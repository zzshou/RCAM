Some analysts said the data indicated that recent measures implemented by the government to boost growth, including lowering interest rates, had started to take effect and that the economy was likely to rebound in the coming months. \"This suggests the effect of policy easing is being transmitted to the economy and reinforces our view that growth has bottomed in second quarter at 7.6% and will rebound in the third quarter to 8.1%,\" said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Nomura.

The HSBC PMI reading has remained below the threshold 50 mark for the past nine months. China's manufacturing sector has been hurt by falling demand from key markets such as the US and eurozone. And as those regions continue to grapple with economic issues and slower growth, there have been concerns that China's manufacturing may slow further. Analysts said that even though the latest data indicated that the pace of contraction had slowed, the sector had yet to fully recover. \"China's manufacturing slowdown momentum has yet to be fully reversed,\" Qu Hongbin, Co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC said in a statement. \"The current PMI reading remains below break-even level.\" As demand from its key overseas markets has declined and the pace of its economic growth slowed, China's policymakers have taken steps to ease monetary policy in a bid to boost domestic demand and sustain growth.

DeGale, 30, suffered damage to his ear drum and teeth during the contest but wanted a rematch with the 33-year-old. \"I thought I'd done enough but it was the knockdown,\" DeGale told Sky Sports. \"I've had 25 fights, I'm going to get better and I want the rematch. \"I'm glad I'm still the champion and I'm coming home with the title but I'm so upset that I didn't come with the WBC belt. The main thing is I didn't lose, I'm still the champion and I can move forward.\" DeGale has now won 23 times, drawn once and lost once as a professional, while Jack failed to win for only the fourth time in his 24-fight career. The British fighter was making the third defence of his IBF belt and made a bright start, knocking Jack down with a straight left inside the opening three minutes. But Jack got back into the contest and had success with a number of body shots in the sixth round, and dislodged DeGale's gumshield with an uppercut in the eighth round, which later led to DeGale losing one of his front teeth. DeGale landed some punches in the 10th, but was floored by a short uppercut in the final round, which ultimately cost him the victory. Former five-weight world champion Mayweather said Jack would not fight DeGale again and would move up a weight instead. \"We don't need to figure it out, I'm the promoter this is my fighter,\" Mayweather said. \"Badou Jack has got too big for 168lbs.

{"id": 36, "article": "Maybe they should be thinking a bit more about SNP supporters too - many of whom are far from convinced about the EU. Polls are indicating that up to a third of SNP supporters could vote to leave. And as about half of the Scottish electorate are now SNP voters, that is a sizeable chunk of votes. Recent messages from the UK wide Remain camp suggest they have not properly considered how their arguments will sound in Scotland. When George Osborne claims that if there is a vote to remain that will take Scottish independence \"off the table\" for a generation does he not understand that he is practically daring voters who support independence to vote to leave? Nicola Sturgeon has said that if the UK votes to leave, but a majority of Scottish voters want to remain, that could provoke a second referendum on Scottish independence. But she is now playing down that possibility, telling voters this referendum is not about Scotland's position within the UK and urging them to vote remain. As she is trying to focus her supporters' minds on the question on the ballot - membership of the EU - she is not helped by English politicians repeatedly bringing up the question of Scotland's future. Last week John Major said a vote to exit the European Union  could \"tear apart the UK\", and could make pressure for a second vote on Scottish independence \"politically irresistible\". He said he hoped voters would hear yet one more reason to stay in the EU. But if your primary political goal is achieving an independent Scotland it sounds more like an invite to vote to leave. This referendum is already very confusing for many Scottish nationalists. Their party's leadership and all its elected politicians are urging a vote remain. Yet some of the arguments for leaving are remarkably similar to their own reasons for wanting Scottish independence. And they hear the remain camp issuing dire warnings about the consequences of separation that are almost exactly the same as the arguments that were deployed against Scottish independence just 20 months ago. One young SNP Remain campaigner told me \"the hardest place to be in politics right now is a nationalist supporting remain\". That may explain why we haven't seen much of Ms Sturgeon out on the stump making the case for a vote to remain. The SNP have been remarkably low key during this referendum. But if other remain campaigners from south of the border hope to rally the SNP vote to their side they might want to think more carefully about the language they use.", "question": "This week the remain campaign is focusing on Labour voters - politicians who want to stay in the EU are worried many them have not been persuaded of the @placeholder of EU membership .", "option_0": "future", "option_1": "importance", "option_2": "merits", "option_3": "challenge", "option_4": "issue"}

More than 200 head teachers in West Yorkshire have attended council-run seminars providing advice on lockdowns. The government said it \"constantly reviewed\" security guidance it issues. The seminars, run in collaboration with police, the fire service and the North East Counter Terrorism Unit, give advice on managing a potentially violent or dangerous event in or around a school. Five have been held since the beginning of 2016, with organisers aiming to have covered every school in West Yorkshire by Easter 2018.

Huddersfield's Reinwood Junior School is one of several in West Yorkshire which carries out lockdown drills, with pupils and staff practising twice a year. After a pre-recorded alarm and message is played from the tannoy, pupils get under tables, teachers lock classroom doors, lights are turned off and window shutters pulled down. Ian Darlington, Year Six teacher at the school, said it was better to practise so that it \"almost becomes second nature\" to the pupils. \"Initially it might appear that we are raising concerns, raising children's fears, but in actual fact they're quite calm doing it now,\" he said. \"They understand the importance of doing it and it doesn't worry them.\" Chris Keates, NASUWT General Secretary, said: \"Responsibility for ensuring security and terrorism preparedness should be the responsibility of the whole governing body. \"It would not be appropriate for the government simply to require schools to have preparedness plans in place and assume that they are able to do this. \"Schools will already have plans in place to respond to a range of emergency scenarios, but it's important that they are given specific advice and support on what additional provisions are considered necessary and the support and advice to implement them.\" A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Schools have a legal responsibility to ensure staff and pupils are safe. \"We provide a range of support for schools and constantly review guidance to ensure it is comprehensive and up to date.\"", "question": "Schools need a @placeholder strategy for lockdown procedures in case of a dangerous event taking place on their premises , a teaching union said .", "option_0": "better", "option_1": "slight", "option_2": "coherent", "option_3": "temporary", "option_4": "special"}

Mr Liu's brother confirmed the Nobel laureate had been diagnosed with cancer on 23 May, his lawyer Mo Shaoping told the South China Morning Post. He was released days later and is now being treated in the northern city of Shenyang. \"He has no special plans. He is just receiving medical treatment for his illness,\" Mo Shaoping told AFP news agency. A statement from the government in Liaoning said Mr Liu had been released on medical parole and was being treated by eight tumour experts. Most people in China have never heard of Liu Xiaobo due to the censorship of discussion about him here. That it could take a month for news of his release to become public gives you an idea of the level of sensitivity. It also shows that his transfer to hospital by no means guarantees his friends and family will be able to visit. After the brutal crackdown in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989 Mr Liu was driven to the front gate of the Australian embassy and an Australian diplomat said that he had to choose in or out. He decided not to leave, believing he could be more effective trying to make change from within. This commitment to a very different China has led to him paying a terrible price. The Nobel committee described Liu Xiaobo as \"the foremost symbol\" of the human rights struggle in China. He never collected his prize and was represented by an empty chair. The Chinese government, which regards him as a criminal, was infuriated by the award. Diplomatic ties with Norway were frozen. Relations were normalised only last December. Mr Liu has three years left to serve of an 11-year sentence for \"inciting subversion\" after drafting Charter 08 - which called for multi-party democracy and respect for human rights in China. Amnesty International said he should never have been jailed. It urged China to ensure he received \"adequate medical care, effective access to his family and that he and all others imprisoned solely for exercising their human rights are immediately and unconditionally released\".", "question": "Chinese Nobel @placeholder laureate Liu Xiaobo has been moved from prison to hospital after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer .", "option_0": "award", "option_1": "peace", "option_2": "literature", "option_3": "lost", "option_4": "hopes"}

The race takes competitors through farm tracks, footpaths, open moorland and tarmac and attracts thousands of spectators. By Friday night 249 runners had registered, and by early Saturday morning there were 100 relay teams of three and 50 horses, although more signed up shortly before the race began. Horses are required to go through three vetting stations - at the start, the midway point and the end of the race and if they fail any checks they are disqualified. The race was affected by heavy showers, and Tony Egan, who organised it for the first time, said that had made the ground \"soft and squidgy in places\". But he said he had spoken to many competitors, who told him how much they enjoyed the challenge. \"They said they had a great time. It's good to see how popular it is,\" he added.

The paper says Portadown is \"reeling\" after the tragic death. It quotes Hilary Woods, the assistant principal at Craigavon Senior High School, who says GCSE exams are ongoing so the school will endeavour to keep operating.

Later in the paper, there's an editorial on sudden deaths. It says that while there has been no confirmation of how the girl died, \"it is important that we continue to emphasise the danger people using these substances are putting themselves in and try to persuade them that the risk is not worth it\". \"Drugs have been responsible for a horrendous toll of carnage in recent weeks and months, particularly among young people,\" it continues.

The Irish FA's Appeals Committee decided the Disciplinary Committee had been too lenient in suspending the two matches for a probationary period of six months. Normally, Hamilton would have got a straight four-match suspension for the comments made to the referee, but at the appeal hearing it was stated that the Disciplinary Committee had some sympathy with the Glenavon player-manager's case. Hamilton, and Glenavon chairman Adrian Teer, spoke at the appeal hearing. In its published findings, the Appeals Committee said Hamilton had shown \"a deplorable lack of respect for the referee\" and that such behaviour would not be tolerated. The Appeal Hearing was told that the two assistant referees and fourth official reported that Hamilton had behaved aggressively in the officials' changing room.

{"id": 57, "article": "And so, this time the tidings are good and arrived over the weekend. Monsoon hits Kerala, India ready to tap it , announced a relieved Business Standard on Saturday. The newspaper said the southwest monsoon, \"the lifeline for millions of farmers across the country\" had hit the southern state on its \"usual onset date\". Even Bollywood's biggest star Amitabh Bachchan joined the celebrations. \"The monsoons have reached Kerala and the Lakshdweep islands... This is a good sign... A week later, traditionally, they should be over Mumbai... This is an indicator of a normal monsoon. We survive and depend on this rain phenomena and much of India's produce depends on its performance - the monsoons I mean,\" the actor wrote on his blog. Monsoon rains are serious business in India. Editorials are written on it, weather experts talk about it on prime time news television, and people send up prayers when it's delayed. Weather insurance policies with built in rainfall insurance are sold to farmers as a hedge against uncertain weather. A good monsoon leads to bountiful crop which raises farm incomes, boosts rural consumption and drives the economy. A weak monsoon - and droughts, in extreme cases - hurts farm workers, raises food prices, encourages hoarders and generally creates havoc in the economy. As early as in 1925, the Royal Commission On Agriculture In India described the Indian economy as a gamble on the monsoon. Some three decades later, in 1953, the prestigious The Economic Weekly in a long editorial simply titled The Monsoon bemoaned the lack of proper meteorological tools to forecast monsoons and said: \"Had the annual rainfall meant as much in the economic life of Europe as it does in this country, it is a permissible guess that some measure would have been found for it ere long\". More than half a century later, the Business Standard reported over the weekend: \"The rains, from June to September, are vital for the 55% of farmland without irrigation in India, one of the world's largest producers and consumers of food.\" Consider the facts and you realise why over a billion people are obsessed with monsoon rains. India's farms are mainly rain-fed. The country receives 75% of its yearly rainfall between June and September. Some 70% of Indians depend directly or indirectly on farming. Farming accounts for 14.5% of India's $1.83 trillion GDP, and though its share is declining, agriculture still accounts for a whopping 58% of the total employment in the country. And then there's the spectre of drought. Some 68% of India, according to the Indian Space Research Organisation, is prone to droughts in varying degrees - a third of this area is actually \"chronically drought prone\". Between 1801 and 2002, according to one estimate, India faced 42 severe droughts, many of them damaging crops and hurting growth. To rely less on the vagaries of the monsoon rains, India, say experts, needs to develop varieties of rice, pulses and oilseeds which are drought resistant, evolve early drought warning systems and improve meteorological tools to provide sharper forecasts. It also needs to ramp up its still scanty water conservation efforts. Too much water gets wasted. India also needs to manage its huge food stocks - over 60 million tonnes at the start of this year - much better. Too much food gets destroyed and damaged. That, many say, is a bigger tragedy than an imprecise monsoon forecast.", "question": "This is possibly the only time of the year in India when over a billion people @placeholder an unusual bit of news with bated breath .", "option_0": "anticipated", "option_1": "deserve", "option_2": "await", "option_3": "heard", "option_4": "enjoy"}

The event at Biggin Hill in south-east London marked 75 years since 18 August 1940, when British and German pilots engaged in the hardest fought day of the Battle of Britain. After taking off just after 13:00 BST, the iconic fighters circled London and then flew to the battle's official memorial at Capel-le-Ferne near the White Cliffs of Dover. On their return they wowed the crowds with multiple flypasts of the airfield - banking, climbing, diving and weaving as they went. Dozens of veterans of the Battle of Britain and other World War Two servicemen and women were also invited to take part in the commemoration. Flying Officer Gerry Abrahams, who flew Lancaster bombers over Germany during the war, said the event was a fantastic opportunity to see a huge number of Spitfires and Hurricanes in one place. \"It's never happened since the war it's incredible.\" He and the other veterans were given a VIP view of the display, a sit-down lunch and dozens of requests from members of the public asking them to accept a handshake to thank them for their service. Once the Hurricanes and Spitfires were finally back on the ground, the spectators were given the opportunity walk among the aircraft. Kevin Wilford, of Caterham, Surrey, said he had brought his grandson Peter to the event because \"you'll never get the opportunity to see this many Spitfires again\". \"It's been fantastic, seeing them flying all round, all over the place was like a trip back in time. \"I've been to airshows before but it's not like this,\" he added.

{"id": 61, "article": "\"French Londoners, France loves you,\" he told a rally, urging them to come home because their country needed their drive and expertise. He cited the frequently aired claim that London was France's sixth-largest city, with an estimated 200,000 French residents. In fact it would rank about 30th. But what drew Mr Macron to the UK was perhaps not so much the number as the type of French people living in its capital. Many are young, educated, upwardly and geographically mobile - exactly the constituency he has galvanised at home. Opinion polls suggest he has a chance of reaching the second-round presidential run-off in May and could even win the presidency. Queuing to hear him speak in Westminster on Tuesday was Elise Siouve, 25, a biotechnology postgraduate at Cambridge University, who felt Mr Macron \"understands the need to adapt to social and economic changes\". Another Cambridge student, Benjamin Vendrand-Maillet, 24, has set up a unit of Macron supporters at the university. For him, the centrist's market-friendly policies would work \"for all French people, whether rich or poor, young or old\" and he was best placed to defeat the populist Front National. The main challenge for French candidates campaigning abroad is that turnout is low among expats. In the UK, it is typically about 30%. Why bother to vote when you have decided to make another country your home? But Mr Macron could benefit from the UK's vote to leave the EU, which he deeply regrets. French residents who may suddenly be unsure of their long-term status in the UK could find renewed interest in politics back home. This is the case for Sylvie, a Macron fan who is studying for a doctorate in Oxford. \"I lost interest in France for four years because I found what was going on there dispiriting,\" she says. \"Since Brexit I've realised that I might have to go back to France, so I'm much more involved now.\" Restating the message he had delivered to UK Prime Minister Theresa May earlier in the day, Mr Macron promised the crowd of about 2,000 that he would attract talent back to France by freeing up the economy and encouraging risk-taking and enterprise. He said he had been shocked when a French person he met on the Eurostar train to London had told him that he had gone to Britain to establish his start-up business because he had found it impossible to do so at home. \"What is at stake in this campaign,\" he said to loud applause, \"is making sure that women and men who are willing to create jobs and wealth, who want to change their own lives and that of others, can never say 'I tried to do it in France but it's better to do it a two-hour Eurostar ride away'. I don't want to hear that ever again.\" Mr Macron is hoping to buck an international trend towards anti-globalisation populism in a country where market reforms have never been popular. The five-horse race for the French presidency remains wide open. In recent weeks polls have consistently placed far-right leader Marine Le Pen ahead in the first round on 23 April. But they have also suggested she would lose the run-off two weeks later. That suggests the top prize in this election could go to the initial runner-up. Mr Macron surged ahead of his rivals in January but his support has wobbled over the past week, following an outcry over his comment that the colonisation of Algeria had been a \"crime against humanity\". Mainstream conservative Francois Fillon appears to be staging a comeback after damaging allegations over payments to his wife. Two left-wing candidates are not far behind. But what is clear is that the winning candidate will be the one most able to mobilise his constituency - hence the potential importance of the expat vote in this race. \"It is too close to call,\" says Benedicte Paviot, London correspondent for France 24 television. \"French presidential candidates can't afford to ignore French nationals abroad.\"", "question": "For France 's centrist presidential hopeful Emmanuel Macron this was the chance to @placeholder close - up with thousands of expat voters .", "option_0": "renew", "option_1": "prevent", "option_2": "engage", "option_3": "do", "option_4": "TRUE"}

The number of pupils who said they had taken illegal drugs also halved. The HSCIC based its figures on a survey of more than 5,000 pupils in England. Young people at 174 schools were questioned in the autumn term of 2013. Health charity Ash said smoking in children had fallen to a record low. The results show that the rates of school pupils drinking, smoking and taking illegal drugs are continuing to decline. Drug use among pupils has stayed stable at 6% for the last few years, but is still half the level it was in 2003. In the 2003 survey, one in four school pupils said they had drunk alcohol in the past week. In 2013, the figure was one in 10. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of health charity Ash, said smoking levels among 15-year-olds were now well below the government target of 12%. She said action taken by the government to ban tobacco advertising, put larger health warnings on packs and make all enclosed public places smoke-free had made a difference. \"But more needs to be done and plain standardised tobacco packs are the obvious next step,\" she said. Fears that electronic cigarettes could become a gateway into smoking for young people have not materialised so far, she added. \"We need to keep monitoring use in young people, and make sure advertising and promotion of electronic cigarettes doesn't glamorise their use.\" The percentage of pupils who said they smoked at least one cigarette a week in 2003 fell by two-thirds, to 3% in 2013.

The limits were put in place after the government-owned People's Daily labelled the game \"poison\" and called for more regulations. Also translated as Kings of Glory, Honour of Kings is a fantasy role-playing \"multiplayer online battle arena\" game. It's very similar to another Tencent game, League of Legends, which is the world's most popular PC game. There are a few differences. Unlike League of Legends, it's based on Chinese historical characters. It's also specifically designed for play on a mobile platform. This is a key reason it's so popular in China, where many gamers don't have access to a games console or PC at home. The app is free to download, but players pay to upgrade their characters or costumes to help them advance to the next level. Estimates about how much an average player spends vary from about $1.50 to $6 a month. That doesn't sound like much, but it all adds up in a game with more than 50 million monthly active users. Parents and teachers worry that children are becoming addicted to the game. While hand-wringing over gaming is nothing new, Honour of Kings has drawn particular scorn from the government-owned People's Daily newspaper, which called it \"poison\" and a \"drug\" that harms teenagers. It also called for tighter regulatory controls of online games. Tencent's revenue model depends on getting existing gamers to spend more time on their products. Its last annual report says its strategy is to turn casual gamers into \"midcore\" or \"hardcore\" gamers. Tencent made $7.2bn in the first quarter of this year, and more than half - about $3.9bn - came from gaming. Two titles dominate its catalogue. League of Legends is its biggest title globally, but in China Honour of Kings is its highest grossing mobile game. Chinese gaming industry database CNG estimates the game generated about $810.5m in the first quarter of this year. That would equate to about 11% of its total revenue. Tencent is a huge company. Besides gaming it's in payment services, social media and messaging apps (notably the phenomenally successful WeChat). The great majority of Tencent's business is in China, so it's vulnerable to regulatory changes there. This could add to investor anxiety. After Tencent brought in the time limits, its shares fell 4%, wiping $12bn off its market value. But shares have rebounded slightly since then. As a whole, the company has grown more than 40% over the past year, and it says the limits won't have much impact on the bottom line, because children under 12 are only a small part of its user base.", "question": "Chinese internet giant Tencent @placeholder its profits wo n't take a hit from a decision to limit the time children can play one of its most popular games .", "option_0": "expects", "option_1": "defended", "option_2": "suffered", "option_3": "offer", "option_4": "insists"}

Sulaiman said some boxing jurisdictions had taken \"steps backwards\" in allowing longer rounds in the women's sport. He said the organisation would \"limit the dehydration and the fatigue elements to lower as much as possible the risk of a tragedy\". Flyweight Adams' next bout in Leeds on 13 May is on the undercard of Josh Warrington's WBC International featherweight title fight with Kiko Martinez. As Adams' fight is not for a WBC title, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) have allowed for the extension of the bout to four three-minute rounds. Ireland's London 2012 Olympic champion Katie Taylor has also called for the move and Adams' management believe it will be the first time a women's bout has featured the same length of rounds as their male counterparts in the UK. \"Female boxing has come a long way since Jane Couch MBE made the sport possible here in the UK in 1998,\" said Adams. \"However, there is still a way to go until both male and female boxers can campaign under the same competition rules.\" Adams is now intent on winning the right for women to wear lighter gloves. The BBBofC's rules specify women must use 10oz gloves, a factor Adams' management believe is even more limiting than round length as gloves become heavier with perspiration as a fight progresses. \"It's great that the BBBofC has supported this first change and hopefully changes to glove sizes will come next,\" said Adams. In the men's game, fighters competing from flyweight to welterweight are allowed to wear 8oz gloves.

There are also concerns that as many as 11 of those set to enter the cabinet of 25 may hold dual citizenship, meaning MPs could veto them under Afghan law. However Ghulam Jilani Popal's decision not to go for the finance portfolio was due to disagreements with the president on a number of unspecified issues, according to an unnamed government official cited by Reuters. The official said Mr Popal was instead being considered for the Independent Directorate of Local Governance, countering the message from the presidential palace that personal reasons were behind his withdrawal. The new nominee for the position of finance minister is expected to be Eklil Ahmad Hakimi, Afghanistan's current ambassador to the United States. The news follows the revelation that President Ghani's nominee for agriculture minister, Mohammad Yaqub Haidari, is on Interpol's most wanted list over allegations of tax evasion in Estonia which date back to 2003. Forming a cabinet has proved difficult due to the current balance of power, with Mr Ghani's opponent in last year's elections, Abdullah Abdullah, holding the position of chief executive. A power vacuum at key ministries has hit the economy and hampered efforts to contain a burgeoning Taliban insurgency, emboldened by the withdrawal of most foreign troops last year. Another controversy, over the issue of dual citizenship, is currently raging ahead of a crucial parliamentary vote of confidence in the new 25-strong cabinet on Friday. Eleven potential cabinet ministers, including Mr Popal, hold dual citizenship according to Abdul Qader Zazai, a member of the committee screening nominees.

Critics fear the referendum will undermine Bosnia's tenuous stability. Of Republika Srpska's 83 MPs, 45 voted in favour of the referendum while 31 abstained and the rest did not take part.

Funding will only be offered to those competitive with the world's best. Coaches rather than cash will be the LTA's main currency in future. The key adjustments include: The philosophy of the LTA started to evolve even before Michael Downey took over as chief executive in January of this year. Funding for elite players had already been reduced from ¡ê12m to ¡ê10m for 2014, and could only be claimed by players under 24 who agreed to pay back 20% of the prize money they earned. The pace of reform has, however, been speeded up dramatically. The LTA is mindful of the need to reduce spending, but is also increasingly of the view that having too much too soon can hinder a player's development. The hope is that if a player has to stay with a host family rather than in a hotel, and cook for themselves rather than eat out, they will more greatly appreciate the value of each ranking point gained and pound earned. 2013 Wimbledon champion Andy Murray benefited from the attention of world-class coaches such as Brad Gilbert and Paul Annacone when they joined the LTA at great expense in 2006.

{"id": 105, "article": "The 28-year-old will sign his contract on Tuesday and will be in place as pre-season training starts on Wednesday. The Scot left Valencia in May but said leaving Champions League football for a club who narrowly avoided Premier League relegation is a positive move. \"It's a forward step to a different type of football. Not stronger or weaker, different,\" he told BBC Sport. Cathro decided in February to vacate his role at Valencia - a position that seems likely to be filled by former Manchester United assistant Phil Neville - partly because he was keen to be closer to his family in Dundee, but also because he was eager to become a manager in his own right. Indeed, he was only dissuaded from doing so a year previously when head coach Nuno Espirito Santo asked his assistant to join him in making the move from Portuguese top flight side Rio Ave to Valencia. But Cathro, who held talks with Rangers before the appointment of Mark Warburton as the Ibrox club's manager, refused to entertain suggestions that accepting a role on the Newcastle staff was at odds with his stated ambitions. \"I wanted a fresh challenge and didn't want to just sit it out over there and wait for the right manager's job to come up,\" he said. \"To come into British football as a manager with no experience of working with English-speaking players is perhaps not advisable anyway so this makes perfect sense.\" Ill-feeling and despair enveloped St James' Park last season, with fans angered by an apparent lack of interest and ambition on the part of owner Mike Ashley. However, Ashley's assurances over his commitment, promise of more investment and the appointment of McClaren have lifted spirits and convinced Cathro of the club's potential. \"Steve coming in has brought a freshness and enthusiasm to get the club back to where it should be and serve the love that exists for it,\" Cathro added. \"I'm convinced that it's a club willing to grow and would be comfortable higher in the league. It's now ready to do that.\" A parallel could be drawn with the Valencia that Cathro discovered upon his arrival. The club were in flux off the pitch and floundering on it, having failed to qualify for European football the previous season. By the time he left 12 months later, the Mestalla outfit were in the Champions League qualifying round. It is a lot to leave behind, but Cathro has no regrets. \"I'm completely comfortable with it,\" he said. \"I'm going to watch Valencia in the Champions League and in La Liga and enjoy them playing in wonderful games in great stadiums. \"But I've no fear of missing out because the intention is to go to that level again. If that was with Newcastle, that would be perfect, but if not I'll certainly be back working abroad in the next five to 10 years.\" Such confidence was partly what attracted Rangers to Cathro during their search for a new manager. It had been suggested that his decision to leave Spain was informed by that interest but the former Dundee United youth coach is adamant that the initial contact and two informal meetings with Ibrox directors Paul Murray and John Gilligan only came after he had decided to return to Scotland. \"I was interested in the uniqueness of the challenge,\" he said. \"And it would be foolish not to talk to them, but it may not have been the correct conditions for me to begin as a manager and perhaps they adopted a similar view. \"It was a positive experience and I'd wish them well because they demonstrated that they were keen to really look at what caused the issues on the football side in the past and build something different.\"", "question": "Ian Cathro will be @placeholder as Steve McClaren 's assistant at Newcastle within the next 48 hours .", "option_0": "assessed", "option_1": "known", "option_2": "offered", "option_3": "reinstated", "option_4": "confirmed"}

The decision to sue the BBC and South Yorkshire Police comes after Sir Cliff was the subject of a long-running police investigation based on allegations dating between 1958 and 1983 made by four men.

{"id": 110, "article": "Once again, many of the main performance targets - including ambulance response times, delays in A&E, and treatment for cancer - have been missed All this against a background of increased attendances, more referrals and GPs being busier than ever So is the NHS is stuck in a never-ending cycle of soaring demand? The kitchen at Stanborough Lodge care home in Welwyn Garden City is part of the NHS frontline in the fight to ease the strain on hospitals. The health service has funded training for staff at more than 20 homes in the area in skills such as nutrition and dementia care, and that has affected day-to-day activities such as encouraging residents to help prepare healthy food. It is one of 50 schemes across England under the \"Vanguard\" programme - to improve care and highlight ways of working efficiently.  There is close support from a GP linked to the home, and a pharmacist, Puja Vyas, who has tackled unnecessary medication. She said: \"They'll be on seven or eight medicines. The most I've seen is 16. There's a lot of things that could have been stopped years ago. \"I've got the time and expertise to go through the medicines they're taking, and say which ones the patient really needs.\" Early results are encouraging. Last month there were no falls. Before the scheme there were about eight a month. Ambulance calls are down more than 30%. The NHS is pinning a lot on these schemes, which are being trialled in a range of settings. Nigel Edwards, from health think-tank the Nuffield Trust, says the initial findings from care home vanguards are encouraging, but some other areas have not fared so well. \"There are 400,000 or so people in care homes who constitute a significant amount of activity in emergency and geriatric medicine so that would definitely help. \"But there's also a big demand from younger patients and patients living at home. That's been harder to deal with.\" So what is fuelling demand on the NHS? As well as a growing and ageing population, Nigel Edwards points to changing expectations and new treatments for patients who previously would have been beyond help. Unless the NHS adapts, he says, in the next five years it will need an extra 16,000 beds. But there is an argument the health service could manage demand comfortably, if it focussed better on patients' real needs. Hamish Dibley is an independent healthcare consultant who has worked for several health service trusts. All too often, he says, they confuse rising activity with demand - which he argues is stable and predictable. \"We've seen everyone who's going to appear in the urgent care system within the first three months of every financial year, and they keep repeating and boomeranging around year on year, until ultimately they die. He says this is entirely avoidable, if the system re-directs its efforts on what he calls the \"vital few\". Seventy-year-old Anthony Rodwell from Berkshire is a classic example of this group. Last autumn he was told he should have an operation to remove a wisdom tooth. Then he learned he needed major heart surgery, and he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Time and again the heart operation has been put back, and the cancer treatment disrupted, because of delays to the tooth procedure. He has been seen at nine different hospitals, culminating in an emergency admission for his heart. \"It seems appalling to me that you'd have to have so many appointments, speak to so many people, travel so many miles to so many different hospitals, to have different tests done. It just seems a terrible waste of resources to me.\" Hamish Dibley says this case shows how a failure to get different parts of the system to pull together for the patient only increases activity. Nigel Edwards argues the challenge for the NHS is not just to curb admissions: the \"bigger win\" is in reducing length of stay. To do that, he says it is vital to invest more in community services and social care so patients can go home promptly. But he is worried. \"The community workforce is ageing. There have been reductions in some areas in numbers of community nurses. \"And I think we're going to have to see the NHS pull its finger out a bit in terms of making those investments.\" Whatever differences there may be about why the NHS is so stretched, there is no denying that with money so tight and performance slipping on many fronts, time to find a solution is running out.", "question": "The latest batch of monthly figures from the NHS in England @placeholder a service that 's struggling to keep up with demand .", "option_0": "devised", "option_1": "offer", "option_2": "suggest", "option_3": "describes", "option_4": "continues"}

{"id": 113, "article": "Experts say it could be better than just checking blood pressure and cholesterol to assess heart risk. So far, they have tested it only on men, but the British Heart Foundation-funded researchers say it should work in women too. The test, called troponin, looks for a protein released when the heart muscle is damaged. Doctors already use the same blood test to help diagnose men and women who they suspect have just had a heart attack. But researchers from Edinburgh and Glasgow universities say it should be used to help patients avoid ever reaching this point. In their study, Prof Nicholas Mills and colleagues found men who had higher levels of troponin in their blood were more likely to have a heart attack or die of heart disease up to 15 years later. But putting some of these high-risk men on preventive treatment, such as cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, lowered their risk as well as their troponin levels. The 3,300 men in the study had high cholesterol but no history of heart disease. The scientists now plan to do more research involving women too. Prof David Newby, one of the authors of the study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said: \"Troponin is almost like a barometer of heart health. If it creeps up, that's bad and your risk of heart problems increases. If it goes down, that's good. \"It also appears to predict who benefits from statins and opens a door to a whole new way of testing.\" He said it could be a useful addition to measures like blood pressure readings and smoking status when building up a picture of someone's heart risk. Prof Mills said: \"Troponin testing will help doctors to identify apparently healthy individuals who have silent heart disease so we can target preventive treatments to those who are likely to benefit most.\" Dr Tim Chico, a cardiologist from Sheffield University, said: \"The problem with heart disease is that it remains very difficult to detect the early signs in people without symptoms, so these findings may provide a way to help identify people at risk. \"Nevertheless, the best way to treat heart disease is to prevent it in the first place, and this is why a healthy diet, regular physical activity, not smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure is so important.\"", "question": "A @placeholder blood test can predict which apparently healthy patients are at high risk of a heart attack .", "option_0": "regular", "option_1": "powerful", "option_2": "special", "option_3": "major", "option_4": "cheap"}

In the same month, he was given a one-match ban for breaking Scottish Football Association rules on gambling. Barton admitted the Scottish FA charge of placing 44 bets between 1 July and 15 September, while he was a player at Ibrox, and his suspension will carry over into his Burnley career. He has until 5 January to respond to the FA charge. Barton can be registered and play for a club while the investigation is ongoing, but will next be available for Burnley in their Premier League home game against Southampton on 14 January. The FA brought in new rules in 2014 which ban players and staff at clubs down as far as the eighth tier of the English men's football pyramid - as well as at clubs in the Women's Super League - from betting on any football match or competition anywhere in the world. Players and staff are also prohibited from betting on football-related matters, such as player transfers, the employment of managers or team selection. That outright ban on football-related betting applies to all involved in the game from Premier League level down to - and including - the Northern Premier, Southern and Isthmian Leagues. Previously, participants were prohibited from betting on a match or competition in which they were involved or could influence. Barton has been charged with offences allegedly committed under both the new and old rules. His Rangers contract was terminated following a training ground row which led to a falling out with manager Mark Warburton and he played just eight games for the club.

He had a loan spell with Marseille in France for 12 months, before joining Burnley for the first time in August 2015. It is understood that the FA was only made aware of the bets by the betting company in the last few months, which led to its investigation.

They will be attached to the seabed by a three-point mooring spread and anchoring system, making them easy to install in deep water.

The turbines will transport electricity via an export cable from the pilot park to the shore at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire just over 15 miles (25km) away. The pilot project is designed to demonstrate the technology on a commercial scale, according to Statoil. Construction is planned to start as early as next year with final commissioning in 2017, according the company. Currently offshore wind turbines are rigidly attached to the seabed which makes them difficult and expensive to install in deep water.

An environmental group has described it as \"too little, too late\". The inquiry confirmed that the damage was consistent with the impact of scallop dredging.

The Loch Carron reef was dredged twice by scallop fisherman in April. Marine conservationists said the reef was \"devastated\" by the dredging and could take decades to recover. SNH sent divers down to the reef to assess and photograph the damage. The site has now been designated as a Marine Protected Area which prevents further dredging. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: \"We take our duty to protect Scotland's rich marine environment extremely seriously and recognise the importance of safeguarding vulnerable habitats like flame shell beds. \"By introducing a Marine Protected Area and putting in place a ban on dredging we hope to ensure the recovery of the flame shell beds in Loch Carron. \"While we recognise there are concerns around scallop dredging in coastal waters, we must balance environmental concerns with the need for legitimate and sustainable fishing.\" The dredger which caused the damage was operating legally when the damage was caused.

Mr Staley asked the bank's security chief, Troels Oerting, to find the author of an anonymous letter. The letter questioned the past conduct of a senior recruit, Tim Main, who was a former colleague of Mr Staley. The Barclays chief executive had worked with Mr Main for several years while they were at the investment bank JP Morgan. Mr Staley has now received a formal reprimand and a personal financial penalty - which could exceed ?¡ê1m - from his own board. Mr Oerting formerly worked for Europol and is more familiar with being asked to tackle issues of fraud, money laundering and cyber crime. As one insider put it: \"He's a former cop - he calls other cops\". The anonymous letter had a US postmark and Mr Oerting contacted US federal law enforcement agencies to help track down its origin. His enquiry has attracted the attention of the Department for Financial Services in the US. He joined Barclays in 2015 after heading up Europol's Cyber Crime Unit. The BBC is awaiting comment from Mr Oerting. The attempt by Mr Staley to identify the person who sent the anonymous letter has been referred to the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Prudential Regulation Authority, as a potential breach of strict new rules concerning the treatment of whistleblowers.

He has apologised to the board and tried to explain himself in a letter to staff.

The BBC understands that the anonymous letter did not raise any issues of which the personnel department at Barclays were unaware before Mr Main was hired. The whole episode is an unusual and unwelcome distraction for a bank that is trying to put reputational problems behind it. The bank's board held a four hour meeting on Sunday to consider the appropriate penalties for Mr Staley - including his potential dismissal. Mr Staley is popular within the firm and with investors.

Under pressure, Hungary eventually relaxed restrictions on the movement of asylum seekers. Buses and coaches have transported thousands of migrants from the Hungarian capital Budapest  to the Austrian border, with others travelling by train. Hungary said on Saturday that its bus service to the border had been a one-off measure, however. When they reached the border, migrants waited to board buses to a train station in the Austrian village of Nickelsdorf.  Hungary has said it is pressing ahead with plans to tighten border controls despite temporarily relaxing the restrictions. Austrian police officers helped people board trains in Nickelsdorf, with some picking up young children. From there, many headed to Vienna. There were large crowds at the western rail station in Vienna as the migrants arrived.  For many, the destination was Munich. When they arrived in Munich on a special train service, they were greeted with cheers and applause by locals who had gathered to greet them. This little boy was given a kiss by a volunteer worker when he arrived in Munich. Many volunteers had brought food and toys for the new arrivals. Some 450 people arrived on the first service into Munich. This man shows his appreciation of Germany's welcome for the migrants as he arrives at the main train station in Munich by holding a picture of Chancellor Angela Merkel. She has said Germany can cope with an influx of newcomers, with her spokesman saying the decision to open borders to asylum seekers was an exceptional case.

The initial deal had been deemed to be too favourable to the left-wing rebels. The new agreement is not expected to be put to another popular vote, but rather submitted to Congress. \"We have reached a new final agreement to end the armed conflict, which incorporates changes, clarifications and some new contributions from various social groups,\" the two sides said in a statement. It was read by diplomats from Cuba and Norway, the mediating countries, in the Cuban capital, Havana. The statement did not give details of the revised agreement but Colombia's lead negotiator, Humberto de la Calle, said it \"resolves many criticisms\" of the previous deal. One new requirement was for the Farc to draw up a complete list of its assets, to be used for victim compensation, he added. Further details are expected to be released over the weekend. However the leader of the \"No\" campaign, former President Alvaro Uribe, said the new proposals did not go far enough. The previous deal was rejected by 50.2% of voters in a vote held on 2 October. Many objected to the lenient sentences given to fighters who confessed to crimes. Some would have avoided serving any time in conventional prisons. Those who opposed the deal also balked at the government's plan to pay demobilised Farc rebels a monthly stipend while offering those wanting to start a business financial help. Polls had initially indicated that the agreement would be approved by a comfortable margin, but opposition to the agreement had been stronger than expected. Despite the rejection of the deal by voters, President Juan Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his part in the negotiations. Farc, Colombia's largest rebel group, was formed in 1964 with the stated intention of overthrowing the government and installing a Marxist regime. After modest beginnings, the group rose to prominence through the 1980s and 1990s as its association with the drugs trade improved its financial standing. At its peak it was the largest and best-equipped guerrilla force in Latin America. But the number of active Farc fighters has diminished from its estimated high of 20,000 to about 7,000 after thousands of guerrilla fighters were demobilised or killed.

Froome was told he had a condition that required a TUE during the 2015 Tour. However, he said: \"I didn't feel having a TUE in the last week of the Tour was something I was prepared to do. It did not sit well morally with me.\" In 2013 Froome's TUE allowed him to use prednisolone for his asthma for a week before winning the Criterium du Dauphine - a week-long race in June which is usually a good indicator of form leading into July's Tour de France - while in 2014 he took it for a week during the Tour de Romandie, as he defended his title. Britain's most decorated Olympian Sir Bradley Wiggins, who retired in December, and Team Sky have come under scrutiny for Wiggins' use of TUEs and the contents of a medical package he received in 2011, after his confidential medical information was leaked by hackers 'Fancy Bears'. TUEs allow the use of otherwise banned substances if athletes have a genuine medical need, and Wiggins, an asthma sufferer, said he sought them to \"put himself back on a level playing field\". Froome told BBC Sport it was \"healthy\" to be asking questions about why Wiggins was granted a TUE to take anti-inflammatory drug triamcinolone before the 2011 Tour de France, his 2012 Tour win and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. There is no suggestion that either Froome, Wiggins, British Cycling or Team Sky have broken any rules. British Cycling has been unable to provide paperwork to prove the contents of a medical package delivered to Sir Bradley Wiggins in France in 2011, according to MP Damian Collins. Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford told MPs earlier in December the package used by Wiggins contained a decongestant but did not have supporting documentary evidence. Froome, who says he is aiming to win a fourth Tour de France title this year, added: \"The fact that we're having that debate about authenticity means there's a problem with the system. \"I think Wada [the World Anti-Doping Agency] need to tighten their regulations around TUEs, so they're not something that we question, their legitimacy. \"It's not good for sport in general,\" he added. \"The fact that we're discussing the validity of results, that brings it back to the authorities, it is something they need to tighten up on so that there aren't questions being asked anymore.\"", "question": "Three - time Tour de France winner Chris Froome rejected a @placeholder use exemption to treat a medical condition during his 2015 win on moral grounds .", "option_0": "rare", "option_1": "legal", "option_2": "remarkable", "option_3": "controversial", "option_4": "therapeutic"}

The song has a long history and can be traced back to a 19th Century hymn. It was later used by the labour movement in the early 20th Century. We Shall Overcome was taken up as a rally cry and was sung at the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama, led by Martin Luther King. The song was popularised in the 1960s by folk musician Pete Seeger and others, which led it to be copyrighted as a \"derivative work\". Seeger's arrangement has since been performed by many artists, including Diana Ross, Bruce Springsteen and Pink Floyd's Roger Waters. The current dispute arose when a California-based group called the We Shall Overcome Foundation sought permission to include the song in a documentary. New York-based publishers the Richmond Organisation and Ludlow Music Inc refused the request and threatened it with a financial penalty if it violated the copyright. Lawyers from Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman have now taken up the case, claiming that licensing fees for We Shall Overcome have been \"unlawfully demanded and extracted\".

However, they worried that saying so could send the wrong message. Overall, officials were confident the US economy was on a strong footing.

However, to reassure markets that the Fed would not deviate from its set course, the central bank decided to keep its \"considerable time\" language in reference to when the Fed would raise its short term interest rate. That interest rate - known as the federal funds rate - has been at 0% since late 2008, when the Fed slashed rates in the wake of the financial crisis. Most observers expect that the bank will begin raising that rate in the middle of 2015, mostly in an effort to keep inflation in check as the US recovery gathers steam. However, US Fed chair Janet Yellen has sought to reassure market participants that the bank will not act in haste and remains willing to change its timeline should economic conditions deteriorate in the US. The minutes also show that the Fed is still concerned about possibly lower-than-expected inflation, particularly as oil prices continue to decline and wage growth remains sluggish. \"Many participants observed the Committee should remain attentive to evidence of a possible down shift in longer-term inflation expectations; some of them noted if such an outcome occurred, it would be even more worrisome if growth faltered,\" they read.

Australia coach Michael Cheika told the team's official website: \"Very few players have the opportunity to play for the Wallabies, let alone at a Rugby World Cup, so I'm really gutted for them. \"They both play important roles in the side and it is disappointing that we need to replace players. \"James and Sam have been part of the team at various stages this season and I am confident they will be able to step up and grasp the opportunity.\" Australia, who comfortably won their opening game against Fiji 28-13, face their first major test on Saturday when they play England at Twickenham in a must-win match for Stuart Lancaster's side. Coach Cheika surprised many by only naming two hookers in his 31-man squad, but has decided not to replace Palu with another back-rower, instead calling on Hanson, who flew out from Australia on Monday. Cheika said Palu's injury meant the 33-year-old had \"likely\" played his final game for the Wallabies as he has signed to play in Japan next season and falls three caps short of Australia's 60-cap threshold for overseas-based internationals. The loss of New South Wales Waratahs player Skelton, who weighing 140kg was the second heaviest player at the tournament, is a significant one for Australia as his ball-carrying ability will be missed. Cheika said unbeaten Wallabies were underdogs for the Twickenham match, which England must win if they are to qualify from Pool A. \"We're playing in the oppositions back yard,\" he said. \"They've been very successful at that ground.

This got the lamb to shimmy further up the pipe, though not quite close enough to be grabbed by the fire fighters.

Harold Crawford said: \"I brought the old dog and the young dog, I brought the old dog for he's a jealous old dog but I thought the young dog would be the better dog, for he's thinner.\" However it transpired that the older dog, Rover, took the main role in the rescue at its own insistence, despite his wider girth. \"Rover, he looked at it, and looked at me and I just said 'away with ye' and away he went.\" Rover and the lamb emerged from the pipe a few seconds later. \"I don't know where he gets his energy from for he'd need to go on a diet,\" added Harold.

The Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, announced the review in December after peers unanimously voted to support a motion stating the size of the House of Lords \"should be reduced, and methods should be explored by which this could be achieved\".

Axel Springer had wooed Pearson for a long time to be in a position to make an offer for the FT, whereas Nikkei only began its courtship five weeks ago, the FT said. In a dramatic last minute flurry, Nikkei managed to clinch the deal in the final 10 minutes of discussions, it added. Nikkei - an abbreviation of \"Nihon Keizai Shinbun\" which means \"Japanese Economic Newspaper\" - is a widely respected Japanese business publication. The broadsheet dominates Japanese-language business media with 3.16-million paid subscribers, of which 430,000 are online. The Japanese newspaper had been trying to break into English-speaking international markets for decades, but had not enjoyed wide success outside of Japan.

She says she supports \"civil unions\" to protect gay couples but opposes gay marriage. But Saturday's Italian newspapers quoted her as saying: \"For once, I would like to see gay associations, instead of 'ghettoising' themselves... say something to condemn the recent spate of killings of women (in Italy)... All they do is defend their own interests.\" Mr Letta's new coalition is proving as fragile as forecast, because old political enemies of left and right are finding it difficult to work together as a team, says the BBC's David Willey in Rome. Mr Berlusconi, who is not a member of the new government, but who remains an influential political player, is trying to dictate terms and conditions under which the new coalition must operate, adds our correspondent. Political observers say at any minute the media mogul could force new elections by withdrawing the support of his party from the hybrid coalition. Friday's swearing-in of the new government at Rome's presidential Quirinale Palace signalled the end of two months of political deadlock. Since February's inconclusive poll there has been political stalemate in Italy, which is still plagued by economic woes after becoming one of the first eurozone victims of the global financial crisis of 2008.", "question": "A junior equal @placeholder minister has resigned the day after being sworn in to Italy 's new coalition , having said gay people invited discrimination by \" ghettoising \" themselves .", "option_0": "protection", "option_1": "enthusiast", "option_2": "special", "option_3": "phenomenon", "option_4": "opportunities"}
{"id": 192, "article": "The race is dominated by Prime Minister Mark Rutte's centre-right party and that of Geert Wilders, running on an anti-immigration platform. Mr Rutte has said the election is an opportunity for voters to \"beat the wrong sort of populism\". Mr Wilders has pledged to take the Netherlands out of the EU, close all mosques and ban the Koran. His Freedom Party had been leading in opinion polls but they have since suggested his support may be slipping. France goes to the polls next month to elect a new president while Germany is due to hold a general election in September. Wednesday's election also comes amid a diplomatic spat between the Netherlands and Turkey. While a populist surge is still possible in the Dutch ballot, a host of other parties could also do well, leaving Dutch politics fragmented, the BBC's Damian Grammaticas reports from The Hague. As parliamentary seats are allocated in exact proportion to a party's vote share and no major party wants to be in a coalition with Mr Wilders, he has little chance of entering government however well he performs, our correspondent says. In the run-up to the vote, party leaders took part in televised debates, with Mr Rutte and Mr Wilders clashing over how to stem immigration. Mr Rutte dismissed Mr Wilders's plan to close borders and mosques and to ban the Koran as \"fake solutions\". Mr Wilders accused Mr Rutte of providing better healthcare for immigrants than for the Dutch themselves. Lodewijk Asscher of the Labour Party, the junior party in Mr Rutte's coalition, called Mr Wilders a man of \"10,000 angry tweets and no solutions\". The row with Turkey followed Mr Rutte's decision to ban two Turkish ministers from addressing rallies in the country.  In response, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused the Netherlands of being \"Nazi remnants\". Mr Wilders described protesters who rioted outside the Turkish consulate in Rotterdam at the weekend as \"scum\". One opinion poll suggested that the spat, and the riots in Rotterdam, had given anti-immigrant parties a boost. Wednesday's election is expected to be followed by protracted coalition talks. Analysts say a strong showing for Mr Wilders could foreshadow next month's presidential election in France, where far-right, anti-EU contender Marine Le Pen has widespread support.

{"id": 195, "article": "In 1666, fires in London were quite common. Homes didn't have electricity, so real flames were used for lighting, cooking, and heating homes. Also buildings were made out of using wooden timbers and were built closely together, so once they'd started it was pretty easy for fires to spread. No fire had ever grown as big as the Great Fire of London before. The summer of 1666 had been particularly dry, with drought making it more likely that fires would spread. It's thought that the fire started in a baker's shop early in the morning. The shop belonged to the king's baker, Thomas Farynor, in Pudding Lane. With strong winds, the fire spread quickly down Pudding Lane, towards the River Thames and London Bridge. As the fire reached the River Thames, it passed over warehouses full of flammable materials like oil, which quickly set on fire. After just a few hours, London Bridge was on fire too. The fire was stopped from reaching the south side of the river because a section of the bridge was missing. Famous buildings including St Paul's Cathedral, The Royal Exchange, and the Guildhall were completely destroyed, as well as 13,200 houses, and 87 parish churches. Firefighting was much more basic in 1666, and people didn't know nearly as much about stopping fires as we do today. Fire brigades used leather buckets, axes and water to try and stop the fire but, unsurprisingly, they didn't work very well. Instead, a plan was suggested to blow up houses in the path of the fire, so that there would be an area with no houses to act as fuel for the fire to keep growing. The Navy used gunpowder to destroy the buildings and by the next morning, the fire had been stopped. Up to a third of the city was destroyed and more than 70 thousand people were made homeless. Six people were recorded to have lost their lives as a result of the fire but it's thought many more could have died.", "question": "The 2 September 2016 marks 350 years since the start of the Great Fire of London , which changed the skyline of the capital city @placeholder .", "option_0": "twice", "option_1": "sharply", "option_2": "extensively", "option_3": "again", "option_4": "forever"}

She had been due to volunteer at Kylie's outdoor concert in Cambridgeshire and was \"devastated\" to miss it, her mother said. The pop star sent a signed photograph and a personalised video message on disc to the 23-year-old's hospital bed. \"The video message said something like 'I will do extra high kicks for you',\" said her mother \"For me it was extremely emotional and I think I cried more than she did.\" Andy Oxborrow, Bryony's partner and a fellow ambulance volunteer, said she had been \"surprisingly cheerful\" since the accident. \"I knew my girlfriend was strong but she really has amazed me. She is so strong,\" he said. Mrs Charles said Bryony's ankle had been pinned in an operation and she will need further surgery on her right leg. Forklift driver Bob Ellis, who needed 24 stitches in his legs after the accident, is \"on the mend and in good spirits\", his wife said.

The 22-year-old had previously been dismissed by the force after he stole uniform and visited schools without authorisation. Richardson, of Salford, was sentenced at Manchester Crown Court. He was also given a sexual harm prevention order and will be on the sex offenders' register for life. He admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child, one of grooming and one of taking indecent photographs of a child. GMP suspended Richardson in January 2014 after finding he had \"used his role inappropriately\" while entering a school without authorisation on an independent patrol. But, after removing his uniform and warrant card from him, Richardson was again found to have gone to a sixth form college while wearing police uniform. On searching his home, officers found a large quantity of police uniform to the value of ?¡ê970 and arrested him on suspicion of theft. Subsequent allegations of inappropriate contact with children prompted a new investigation in September 2015. Richardson's confiscated phone and computer revealed 4,000 messages had been sent to a 14-year-old girl in Essex. She revealed they had met up in a hotel booked by Richardson. He was then charged with a number of sexual offences and remanded in custody before being formally dismissed in April. Supt Mark Kenny said: \"I am pleased that America Luke Richardson is now off the streets and unable to harm any more young girls. \"We are continuing to investigate the possibility that Richardson may have more victims and we are appealing for anyone who may have been approached inappropriately by him online, or in person, to come and speak to police.\"", "question": "A former @placeholder constable who groomed and engaged in sexual activity with a child has been jailed for five years .", "option_0": "notorious", "option_1": "prominent", "option_2": "special", "option_3": "british", "option_4": "social"}

Mr Bozize was president of CAR for 10 years until he fled to neighbouring Cameroon in 2013 when a group of mostly Muslim rebels - called the Seleka - briefly took control of the country. This sparked reprisals from a mainly Christian militia, called the anti-Balaka, who are seen as close to Mr Bozize. Violence between the rival militias has killed thousands and displaced nearly a quarter of the CAR population. Pope Francis recently urged rival factions to stop fighting, when he visited a mosque in the capital, Bangui.

And that means yet another review. And that expansion at Gatwick will not be ruled out. One source told me that keeping both options on the table means that the airport operators can have their feet \"held to the fire\" over dealing with environmental concerns. That may mean demanding that Heathrow bans staff from driving to work. Or saying that all \"airside\" vehicles (that is vehicles that operate within the airport's perimeter) have to be electric. The government also wants to be able to force more money out of Heathrow or Gatwick - if either are given the go-ahead - to pay compensation to local people who are affected. Keeping both options on the table increases the government's leverage. The decision that there will be yet another delay is likely to go down very badly with businesses which have demanded that the government \"get on\" with expanding Britain's aviation capacity. But the politics of this decision appears to have held sway. David Cameron is still concerned that any decision to back Heathrow will put his \"no ifs, no buts\" pledge in 2009 that there will be no third runway at Heathrow in sharp relief. And that he will face a barrage of criticism that he is not a man of his word. Further, if a decision is not taken until next summer, that means it will come after the election for the next mayor of London, which is in May. Which is convenient, given that the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, is implacably opposed to Heathrow expansion. As is the Labour candidate, Sadiq Khan.

Of course, we are still three days away from that committee meeting and, as with all things Heathrow (and, frankly, government on issues of aviation policy) things could change.

Scunthorpe were in the fourth tier of the league when Glanford Park was built, currently play in the third tier and have spent three seasons in the past decade in the Championship, the Football League's second level. It has also submitted outline planning permission for a multi-use arena and outdoor football pitches at the site.

Such reports are issued if it appears there is a risk of other deaths occurring in similar circumstances, but do not necessarily arise from an inquest. It's a bedside crib with an adjustable height so parents can make it the same level as their bed. The side flaps down to open on to the main bed's mattress so that there is no gap between the baby's sleeping area and the main bed. This means the baby cannot slip between the crib and the bed. Many people believe co-sleeping can be dangerous, and parents may be anxious about accidentally rolling on to their baby in their sleep. The Bednest means the baby can sleep close to the parents without actually being in the bed, and the parent can see and reach the baby without the side of a cot in the way. The side of the Bednest had three positions - fully up, fully down and halfway up. Grace was put to bed with the side in the halfway position and with the head end tilted up higher than the feet - which some parents find helps relieve reflux. The tilt should be no more than 5cm, but Grace was tilted 8cm. When her mother checked on her, Grace had managed to move her head over the side of the crib. The weight of her head meant she could not roll free, and she became unable to breathe and died. The company said the crib should only be used with the side fully up or fully down. The current version of the cot has been modified so the side cannot be left in the halfway position. Bednest has also issued a free kit for people who own a pre-modification crib, which can be fitted to make sure the sides are either fully up or down. Advice on its website says the Bednest should never be used with the folding panel in the half-raised position.

This is at the heart of our company's ethos.\" Following Grace's death, the NCT carried out an investigation which identified a \"small but plausible\" safety risk when using the Bednest crib in the halfway folded-down position.

Coroner Penelope Schofield said in 2015 she had \"a number of concerns\". These included: Yes, but only the modified version. If used correctly, the NCT says the Bednest is completely safe.

The manufacturer provides the latest user guides and instructions on its website. The NCT, which formerly sold the Bednest via its website, no longer has an online shopping division.

Clearly incensed at the accusation - which he rejects - Mr Goldsmith has pushed full steam ahead with his claims that the Labour candidate has given \"oxygen to extremists\". Mr Khan, in turn, fiercely denies this. None of the above sounds particularly positive. Ask either of these candidates who is being negative, though, and they will tell you it's the other guy. If a negative election campaign is one that seeks to discredit one's opponent, then both sides have been doing that to varying degrees. Let's start with the language used by the Conservatives: \"radical\", \"divisive\" and a \"dangerous experiment\". That's how Mr Goldsmith has described his opponent. Labour argues this was to plant the false idea in the minds of voters of their man as a radicalised Islamist. The Tories say that Labour has deliberately misinterpreted the word, and they were referring to what they see as Labour's left-wing, radical direction under new leader Jeremy Corbyn. The Conservatives have put out several posters to that effect, presenting Mr Khan as \"Corbyn's man\", which have popped up at Labour events. Just this week Conservative activists were seen waving anti-Khan banners at a Labour campaign visit in Sutton, south-west London. Mr Goldsmith's team would not confirm whether the gatecrashers were part of their campaign. But Labour has been getting in on the negative poster adverts too, such as the one on housing that bore an uncanny resemblance to Conservative posters. Mr Khan too has called his rival \"divisive\" and drew up a mock CV on social media at the start of the year painting the Conservative as \"a serial underachiever\" who wasn't up to the job of mayor. Recently, the criticism has become even more direct. At a debate on Tuesday Mr Khan began by saying he was \"disappointed\" with the strategy used by his opponent - and Mr Goldsmith fought back, telling him: \"I have never referred to you by your religion.\" Neither wants to be presented to potential voters as an Islamophobe or indeed as an Islamist sympathiser, but winners often take no prisoners.

{"id": 281, "article": "But there's the thing. Even if you consider feats of athleticism to be trifling in the grand scheme of things, there is a chance you still find Ali compelling. Because, with Ali, athletic feats were only a part of the whole. Ali created the mould for the modern athlete and promptly broke it. No athlete has been so great in so many different ways since. Here, BBC Sport breaks Ali's greatness into its constituent parts, in an attempt to explain why there has never been anyone greater and probably never will be. Most boxing aficionados will tell you Ali wasn't even the greatest boxer of all time. But with the very next breath, they might tell you he is the greatest sportsman. This is because making comparisons in boxing is a less exact science than making comparisons in other sports. People will tell you Jack Nicklaus is greater than Tiger Woods because he won more majors. They will tell you Sachin Tendulkar is better than Brian Lara because he scored more runs at a higher average. But attempting to compare boxers who fought at different weights in different eras is the way to madness. Still, it is true that Ali didn't fight on the inside, would lean back rather than slip punches, didn't set his feet and was susceptible to left hooks. And old-timers who saw both in action said Sugar Ray Robinson, who lost only one of his first 131 professional fights, was a more complete fighter. \"Robinson,\" said legendary American boxing writer Bert Sugar, \"was the sweetest practitioner of 'The Sweet Science'.\" However, one of the marks of greatness is the ability to perform great feats without the use of a textbook: true greatness comes from within. And just as coaches tell kids the single-handed backhand is redundant, despite the fact Roger Federer has won 17 majors with it, they will also tell kids that to fight like Ali is nuts: \"Gloves up, chin tucked in - and stop mucking about.\" But saying Ali wasn't as good as Robinson is like saying bliss isn't as good as nirvana. And a frightening thing about Ali is we might not have seen the best of him. Exiled from boxing between the ages of 25 and 28, Ali was spreading his anti-war message on the college circuit when he was at his most vital as an athlete. On paper, Ali is the greatest heavyweight in history. The first three-time world champion in boxing's blue riband division - when there was only one heavyweight world champion at any given time - Ali fought all-comers and whupped almost all of 'em. Another mark of greatness is the ability to evolve and in Ali's case there were four distinct ages: Olympic champion Ali, the innocent boy with a grin; pre-exile Ali, when his feet were a whir, his hands were a blur and nothing could touch him; post-exile Ali, a thicker, slower version with courage to burn; fading Ali, an empty shell of a man whom none of us wanted to see. Ali reigned in arguably the most talent-rich era of heavyweight boxing, winning the title from the fearsome Sonny Liston in 1964, winning it again from the even more fearsome George Foreman 10 years later and beating greats such as Floyd Patterson, Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in between. Even Ali Marque 4 had enough to win the title for a third time from a youthful Leon Spinks. Ali gave us the Rumble in the Jungle and the Thrilla in Manila and many iconic moments in sport. But if anyone wants proof that athletic achievement is about more than a win on the record, I suggest they rewind all the way to Ali Marque 2, particularly his fights against Cleveland Williams and Zora Folley. \"Most fight fans would not spend a dime to watch Van Gogh paint Sunflowers,\" wrote Sports Illustrated's Pat Putnam, in reference to Sugar Ray Leonard's \"artistic perfection\". \"But they would fill Yankee Stadium to see him cut off his ear.\" In his pre-exile pomp, Ali gave fight fans both artistry and gore. Boxing allows for greater feats of heroism than other sports. Kicking a ball around with opponents trying to kick you and thousands looking on might get the ticker going, but it's hardly on a par with being attacked by a 17st man with wrecking-ball hands. Like men born at the wrong time and forced into wars, in some respects Ali was an accidental hero. Liston was the most hated heavyweight champion in history and considered almost unbeatable. People genuinely thought Ali might be killed by Foreman. Ali claimed he almost did die in his third fight against Frazier. But accidental or not, heroism garners great respect. Even those that hated him for his political and religious views - and the fact he refused to be forced into a war he never asked for or agreed with - had to admit: \"This black Muslim who talks too much - he sure has got gigantic cojones. I will give him that.\" Heroism and charisma go hand in hand: with less talent and without the great wins over fearsome men, Ali might have been just another loose-lipped, wise-cracking boxer with a couple of mentions in the history books. Indeed, Ali would have been like his younger brother, Rahman, a mediocre fighter with little of importance to say and famous only because of his connection to Ali. Which is not to say all sporting greats have charisma: entering a room full of people and inducing silence simply because you are famous is not the same. Take Sir Donald Bradman, without question the greatest cricketer ever, of whom it was once written: \"One thing I have noticed is that he can sit still.\" Ironically, it was also written of Ali that he was able to sit still: when the cameras were off and the pens were sheathed, he could apparently be a peaceful presence. But other times he was throwing parties for local kids on his front lawn; reciting poetry; baiting opponents; pouring forth on politics and religion. It wasn't always nice and it didn't always make sense, but it was always irresistible. One of the reasons Ali was charismatic was because he was funny. Genuinely funny, not \"presumably this must have been funny back in the day\" funny. \"I saw Sonny Liston a few days ago...,\" goes the interviewer. \"Ain't he ugly?\" deadpans Ali. \"He's too ugly to be the world's champ, the world's champ should be pretty like me.\" He also did slapstick. Later in the build-up to their first fight, cameras caught Ali chasing Liston, \"the big, ugly bear\", down the street with a lasso. When The Beatles came to town, the story goes John Lennon didn't want to be photographed with Ali because he thought he would lose. By the end of the session Ali, who didn't even know who The Beatles were, had the four of them jumping through hoops. In one five-minute interview, Ali could make you laugh more than Tiger Woods, Roger Federer, Lionel Messi and Tom Brady have in their entire careers combined. Actually, make that a five-second interview. Women have always found hard, powerful men appealing. It's just that hard, powerful men aren't normally funny. And they don't normally look like Ali. Ali was wrong: he wasn't pretty, he was knockout beautiful. And women loved him. Here's how Ferdie Pacheco, Ali's personal doctor, described his patient: \"He had huge shoulders and a broad back which tapered to an extraordinarily small waist. [His skin] was very smooth and soft, and was a gorgeous golden colour. \"In the sunlight, covered with sweat, Ali was a photographer's dream.\" There is an old Chinese curse: \"May you live in interesting times.\" It was both Ali's good luck and misfortune to have appeared at one of the most turbulent times in American history. Misfortune in that his rebellious nature made him deeply unpopular with millions, good luck because it magnified his rebelliousness, his courage, his greatness. People listened to what Ali had to say because of what he achieved in the ring. But it helps if you've got something to say. Whereas Ali was a rebel, Michael Jordan was a brand. Whereas Ali set out to influence his times, Jordan remained aloof. \"He's more interested in his image for his shoe deals than he is in helping his own people,\" American football great Jim Brown said of Jordan in 1992, which was pretty much the height of his fame. Ali declared he \"had no quarrel with the Vietcong\" in 1966, a year before the first significant anti-Vietnam War protests. The governor of Illinois called Ali's stance \"disgusting\" and boxing boards banned him. By 1971, only 28% of Americans agreed with their involvement in the conflict. Ali was a radical, which explains why he was so forceful and magnetic, because he was fuelled by his beliefs. What Tiger Woods believes about the world is anybody's guess. He likes golf? Maybe.

Mr Gordhan's sudden dismissal, part of a reshuffle affecting nine ministers, led to a 5% plunge in the value of the currency, the rand. The ruling African National Congress' deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, called it \"totally, totally unacceptable\" and ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe also opposed it. In 2014, the ANC adopted \"radical economic transformation\" policies to boost the economic position of the black majority in the post-apartheid nation. But many in the ruling party believe the process has been \"too slow and in many instances superficial\", said Mr Gigaba, who was previously home affairs minister. \"The ownership of wealth and assets remains concentrated in the hands of a small part of the population,\" he said.

Six is also the magic number when it comes to spacing - gaps of fewer than six inches between people can spark anxiety or stress. But the biggest faux pas of all is the push-in; queue jump at your peril. The report's author, Adrian Furnham, Professor of Psychology at UCL, said the public nature of queuing means that queue jumping sparks a \"huge sense of injustice\" among those in line. He pointed to previous research by Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede, which claimed: \"The British believe that inequalities between people should be minimized, and everyone should have the autonomy to pursue goals with equal opportunity.\" The UCL study was based on a review of academic literature on queuing at banks, cash points and supermarkets. Other queue no-nos include striking up a conversation while queuing and standing on the wrong side of escalators - though this was mainly a complaint of Londoners who feel tourists \"misuse\" the Underground. The report found the most confusing rule for foreigners could be the practice of one person offering their place in the queue to another. Professor Furnham said: \"The British have a well-established culture of queuing and a very specific type of queue conduct, one that has been known to confuse many a foreign visitor. \"In a time when Britain is changing rapidly, and the ways in which we queue are shifting, the psychology behind British queuing is more important than ever - it is one of the keys to unlocking British culture.\"", "question": "A stiff upper lip , a pot of tea and a nice orderly queue .

The Six Nations, summer tour and autumn internationals are different campaigns, and the wildcard selections can differ for each.

She's also had time to consider who should oversee the vital energy portfolio, and who should represent a resurgent Myanmar, also known as Burma, at summits abroad. And after all that time the answer was staring back from the mirror. Aung San Suu Kyi decided that there could be no-one else, and that she would have to directly run three of the most time-consuming ministries. Only time will tell how that works in practice. But given there are only five working days in a week these ministries could well be guided by someone who shows up for just one day in five. Even with the most efficient support team around you, it's hardly a platform to deliver much-needed ambitious change. Fifteen of the names on the ministerial list were chosen by Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate and former political prisoner, and three by the commander-in-chief of the army. Parliament is expected to vote later in the week to confirm the posts. The NLD has a huge majority in both houses of parliament, although the military automatically occupies 25% of seats.

Gaddafi's government began dismantling its stockpile of chemical weapons over a decade ago, with the last destroyed by the new authorities in 2014. But the existence of chemicals which could be turned into weapons remained a concern, particularly as the so-called Islamic State group began to gain a foothold in the African nation. In July, the Libyan Government of National Accord, a United Nations-brokered coalition of two rival factions, asked for international aid in destroying potential ingredients for new chemical weapons. A number of nations including Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States contributed to the operation, which was backed by the UN Security Council.

He said he was told of a cover-up by Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow's anti-doping laboratory. Russia's sports ministry said it was \"certain about transparency of doping control\" in Sochi. Rodchenkov was not interviewed by the programme, which was broadcast on Sunday, but 60 Minutes journalists said they had listened to recordings of him speaking to Stepanov. The BBC has been unable to independently verify the allegations made in the programme. Stepanov said Rodchenkov told him that agents from Russia's security service, the FSB, \"worked as doping controls officers during the Sochi Games\" and \"tried to control every single step of the anti-doping process in Sochi\". He further claimed he had been told four Russian gold medallists at the Games were using steroids. The World Anti-doping Agency (Wada) has said it will investigate the new allegations. Russian athletes have already been banned from international competition by the sport's world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), after a Wada commission report alleged \"state-sponsored\" doping in the country. The same report said Rodchenkov was complicit, asking for and accepting bribes and destroying blood and urine samples. He later resigned from his role as head of the Moscow lab. Stepanov and his wife, banned athlete Yuliya Stepanova, were the main whistleblowers in a series of German television documentaries in 2014 which alleged \"99%\" of Russian athletes were doping. Those claims led to the Wada independent commission being set up. The IAAF is meeting next month to assess whether Russia has done enough to tackle its doping culture before being allowed to take part in August's Olympic Games in Rio. A spokesman for the Russian sports ministry said a full investigation had been carried out into \"all relevant parties\" since Stepanov's original allegations and it had agreed a 'road map' with Wada to \"guarantee the independence and transparency of the doping control in Russia\".

{"id": 327, "article": "He and his fellow fresh-faced apprentices are huddled around a noisy workbench in Berlin. At just 19, he is one of the youngest in his group at this training centre. Rhys, a keen rugby player, says he is settling into the German lifestyle and has even found a rugby club nearby. He is one of just 2,200 young workers chosen from some 45,000 applicants by the electronics and electrical engineering giant Siemens for its pan-European training scheme. Another apprentice, 21-year-old Gabriel from Northampton, says he came to Berlin to learn the German way. \"They are much more precise, they go into detail a lot more,\" he says. \"It helps you understand why all the best engineers and creatives come from here.\" It is a point that was recently made by the British business lobby group, the CBI. It warned that the UK's traditional educational route, of A-levels followed by a university degree, was not the only path to a good job and could help deepen a skills crisis in the UK. The CBI called for more earn-as-you-learn schemes, supported by companies, alongside traditional degrees - and cited Germany as one of the leaders in vocational education. Siemens's trainees have come from all over Europe for the company's three-year programme, that will give them an income while they learn the art of German engineering. \"I know that right now, it's not the best time to find a job. It's why I'm doing this in Germany,\" says 20-year old Miguel from Madrid. He hopes to return to Spain, despite dire employment prospects at home, where one in two young people is out of work. \"Everybody knows what the label 'Made in Germany' means,\" says 22-year-old Vainius from Lithuania. \"This is a perfect example of how they do it. It is an excellent chance for everyone here.\" In Spain, says Miguel, \"we don't have opportunity to study practical and theory at same time.\" In another classroom at the firm's vast training centre, a British girl stumbles over German grammar. Learning to speak German is part of the deal. Apprentices here are encouraged to immerse themselves in the culture, offered help in opening a bank account and in other aspects of living abroad: it is a very German approach. Germany's vocational system has been around for decades and is deeply embedded in society. A university degree does not have quite the same cachet here that it does in many other developed countries. Youngsters who are not qualified for or interested in going to university can join a programme in which they work part of the week for a firm that pays them and teaches them relevant skills. The rest of the time they spend in school. Chambers of commerce and industry bodies are involved, to ensure that the work and the teaching are matched. After their apprenticeships, the trainees often have jobs to walk into, in sectors including electrical engineering, sales and marketing, shipping and agriculture. Roughly two out of three young Germans go through this system. \"It's a very practical, applied approach, where young people are partly hired, partly subsidised in this dual education system,\" says Nora Hesse, a Berlin-based economist at the Open Europe think tank. \"They do receive some money but not too much, and their education is covered by the company that hires them,\" she says. Martin Stoeckmann, who runs Siemens's training centre, says that the apprenticeships are a good investment for both the young people and the companies involved. \"Around 90% of them stay at Siemens after they finish their education. They are loyal and proud to be at the company,\" he says. The company denies claims that schemes like this represent a brain drain, as Germany sucks in the brightest and best youngsters from all over Europe. \"They are all expected to go home - still working for Siemens - but in their homeland,\" says Mr Stoeckmann. Advocates of Germany's vocational training point to the fact that despite the global recession, the number of young Germans out of work remains low. Youth unemployment in Germany is under 8%, compared with 56% in Spain and 38% in Italy. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the number of 15- to 29-year-olds not in education, employment or training has risen in most OECD countries - except in Germany. However, some argue that there are drawbacks to this vocational bias. Countries that combine school and work-based education, such as Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland, may help young people into jobs, but in older age, these workers' skills can become obsolete, says the influential Munich-based Ifo Institute. Knowledge is also limited to the operations of the company that trains them. Yet with a crisis that has hit growth and the job prospects of many young people across Europe, for the apprentices at Siemens, this system offers hope. Rhys says he is confident of his own future, thanks to the technical training he is getting. But he says that back in Britain - where 960,000 people aged 16 to 24 are jobless - many of his friends face an uncertain future. \"I am worried for a lot of other people,\" he says.", "question": "\" I think the apprentices will be @placeholder a job when we go back , so I think we 'll be OK , \" said Rhys from Bristol .", "option_0": "guaranteed", "option_1": "declared", "option_2": "upheld", "option_3": "appointed", "option_4": "developed"}

Leon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, told 5 Live Breakfast: \"The fact that Trading Standards sit within local government means they're often stretched for resources. \"Central government itself does have back up powers to force people into recalls and to take action. So we would call on the government, in particular the Department for Business Innovation and Skills to take action before someone dies.\" He added: \"I think it's indicative of how the UK views consumer issues. Trading standards services have seen cuts of over 50% over the last few years and actually there hasn't been an outcry from the public because a lot of this stuff goes on in the background.\" A spokesman for the Department for Business said: \"People rightly deserve the assurance that if they buy a product that turns out to be unsafe, this can quickly be rectified.

The men's bodies were found in the Spin Tall area of North Waziristan on Thursday morning,  local residents told the BBC. They were members of the Frontier Constabulary, a provincial police force that operates in Pakistan's tribal areas. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told the BBC that the killing of 12 Taliban fighters during an army operation on 31 December in the Khyber tribal district prompted the militants to kill the men they were holding. They had been kidnapped in a Taliban raid on a check post in the town of Tank near North Waziristan a week earlier. The Taliban spokesman added that the government had taken a \"very dangerous, un-Islamic and unethical step\" by capturing the female family members of the militants killed in the 31 December offensive in Khyber. \"We warned them to release them as soon as possible otherwise consequences will be very harsh but unfortunately they turned a deaf ear to our warning,\" he wrote in an email to the BBC. He also warned of further attacks to retaliate against a military operation launched in northern parts of Balochistan province recently.

{"id": 349, "article": "Both the SDLP and Sinn Fein have suggested creating an all Ireland national forum to consider the implications of Brexit. On Saturday, Sinn F??in deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said the Irish government had confirmed such a forum would be set up. Maybe it would lead to something, but unionists would probably shy away and, at first glance, it looks like a talking shop. Stormont and Dublin ministers are discussing Brexit in their North South Council and an early meeting of the East West British Irish Council has been promised. Neither of these spin-offs from the Good Friday Agreement have proved especially dynamic. But if the UK does sever its EU links then their role could become much more important. As Professor Brendan O'Leary recently pointed out in a lecture at Queen's University, the BIC already straddles islands like Jersey Guernsey and the Isle of Man which are not EU members. The Remain camp will no doubt continue to press for Northern Ireland to retain its EU status. However the opposition Nicola Sturgeon ran into in Brussels shows this is likely to prove an uphill struggle, assuming the next UK prime minister doesn't perform a U turn. So how might what Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan described as the \"unique circumstances\" of the island of Ireland be recognised? Both the Irish and British governments have already made it clear they want to preserve the free movement of goods and people - this will require some first class diplomacy if it is to amount to an Irish \"opt-out\" from barriers erected elsewhere. On the ground, perhaps the remainers could turn to the old Europhile John Hume's dictum that \"it's people that have rights not territory\"? Alongside all the various talking shops, might Dublin consider, for example,  setting up an agency to liaise with Irish passport holders resident outside its borders? That could ensure these EU citizens still have access to European programmes like the Erasmus educational exchanges or the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. Whilst the DUP would no doubt oppose any initiative they believe might be aimed at watering down Northern Ireland's constitutional status within the UK, there seems agreement around the executive table about ensuring Northern Ireland gets a \"good deal\". Stormont's leavers and remainers can at least make common cause by lobbying a future prime minister for extra cash funds to replace any European peace or cross border funding which local groups stand to lose. The challenge in the months ahead will be to ensure the big picture divide between the parties over both the future of the EU and the UK doesn't paralyse the task of trying to alleviate the practical impact of Brexit on ordinary citizens.", "question": "Our politicians are embroiled in discussions about the implications of Brexit on both sides of the Irish Sea , but so far not a lot of concrete @placeholder have emerged .", "option_0": "authorities", "option_1": "unrest", "option_2": "ideas", "option_3": "confidence", "option_4": "crisis"}

In all, 111 prisoners died, and prosecutors argued that most of them were shot dead at close range. The officers' lawyers said they would appeal. Three other policemen were acquitted during the trial. The 23 convicted officers - most of whom are now retired - had originally been accused of killing 15 inmates, but two of the victims were later thought to have been killed by fellow prisoners. Dozens more officers are expected to be brought to trial in connection with the case in the coming months. In 2001, Col Ubiratan Guimaraes, who led the police operation to regain control in Carandiru, was convicted of using excessive force. But he was acquitted on appeal in 2006. 'Self-defence' The riot began on 2 October 1992 after an argument between two inmates quickly spread, with rival gangs facing off in what was at the time one of South America's largest prisons, housing 10,000 inmates.

It's a once in a lifetime thing.\" For Calzaghe, who started boxing as a 10-year-old, there was just one dream that eclipsed that of becoming a boxing world champion... emulating his idol Paolo Rossi. Inspired by his soccer-obsessed father Enzo, himself a schoolboy player for Torres FC, Calzaghe was never one for following his local team Cardiff City, or the trendy teams his mates supported, like Liverpool. For Joe, it was always Vecchia Signora, The Old Lady. \"I've supported Juve since I was nine or 10, I remember crying when they lost 1-0 to Hamburg in the European Cup,\" he said. \"I remember players like Rossi, Roberto Bettega, and Platini playing under Dino Zoff, so I have always been a Juve fan, including when we got relegated to Serie B. \"To be at the Champions League final in Cardiff, it is just a dream come true. \"For it to be at the national stadium where I boxed 10 years ago against Mikkel Kessler, you can't make it up. \"So to be in a final at the stadium that means so much to me, in my hometown, is incredible.

A splinter flame was taken to the Stadium in case the delays were not overcome but the opening ceremony ran late and the flame made it on time. A late-finishing ceremony in Stoke Mandeville and the time required for multiple exchanges of the flame between team members were blamed for the timing slipping throughout the relay. Organisers Locog cut down on breaks and reduced the number of photo opportunities and a late-running opening ceremony meant the the flame was used to light the cauldron in the Olympic Stadium. Crowds gathered in the market square in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to watch the start of the relay and thousands more turned out overnight along the route to cheer on the torchbearers. After arriving in London, the flame, which is being carried by 580 torchbearers, was taken up the steps to Britain's first traditional Hindu temple, the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir temple in Brent, where a torch was lit at about 08:30 BST. Barry Gardiner, MP for Brent, took part in a ceremony which involved pulling apart string made up of different threads and colours to \"allow\" the Paralympic torch through. He said: \"It was a very special moment. We have been waiting since 6.30am and the thrill and excitement is just fantastic.

The idea came after zookeepers noticed signs of boredom, which can affect the behaviourally complex animals in captivity. Unlike the zoo's two female elephants, Putra Mas's temperament prevented him from being walked around the grounds.

Cancer charity CLIC Sargent is calling for the government to ensure better training and guidance for professionals who care for children before diagnosis. NHS England said new guidance had lowered the referral threshold for GPS. The research by CLIC Sargent, released to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, is based on a survey of 333 people - 147 young people aged 16-24 and 186 parents. The charity says each year about 3,800 children and young people are diagnosed with cancer in the UK. About 44% of the young people surveyed said they felt they were not taken seriously enough, making multiple trips to the GP or hospital before they were eventually diagnosed. Over half - 53% - of the young people felt they had received a delayed diagnosis. Of these, 93% believed the perceived delay added to their emotional stress. In 2010, I felt some lymph node lumps in my neck and became obsessive about it, I knew something was wrong. I kept going back to the same doctor for six or seven months and he kept telling me that I was fine and there was nothing wrong, I didn't have cancer. My family and friends kept teasing me, they thought I was being a hypochondriac. In January 2011 I saw another GP, who told me to come back in two weeks if things hadn't changed. When they didn't, I was referred to hospital. My diagnosis was sort of a relief more than anything - obviously I knew something was wrong and now it was getting dealt with. Looking back at it now, doctors can't be expected to know everything. Maybe this doctor had not dealt with any young people with cancer, so maybe he just thought it was something innocent. CLIC Sargent wants the NHS to conduct more research into the impact a delayed diagnosis has on a child or young person's health outcome, treatment and survival rate. 63% of parents said the delay had a negative effect on the emotional wellbeing of their child. CLIC Sargent chief executive Kate Lee said: \"It is simply not acceptable that so many of the parents and young people we spoke to felt their GP didn't take their concerns seriously or that their knowledge of their child's health wasn't recognised. \"It is absolutely vital that medical professionals including GPs are confident and skilled in listening and talking to children, young people and parents - and responding to their concerns. That's why we're calling for health education bodies to make this a core element of professional training.\" As part of its research, the charity also commissioned a survey of 1,000 GPs. It found 46% felt more training was needed to help them identify cancer in children and young people, while 50% said more consultation time would be beneficial. Ms Lee added: \"It is striking that so many GPs feel more can be done to help them identify suspected cancer. Cancer in children and young people is thankfully rare so a GP may only have one or two cases in their whole career.\" Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said:  \"Early diagnosis must be of the highest priority for cancer patients of all ages. This report highlights the challenges of identifying cancer in children, and shows the vital need for everyone, including GPs, to be more aware of the early signs. \"NICE guidance has been recently updated to lower the referral threshold for GPs, and we have begun a major programme of work to test innovative ways to diagnose cancer more quickly in all patients.\" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.", "question": "Some 42 % of parents of children diagnosed with cancer felt their concerns about their child 's health were @placeholder by GPs , research suggests .", "option_0": "affected", "option_1": "compromised", "option_2": "addressed", "option_3": "ignored", "option_4": "answered"}

But she fell after a collision with Budd, who was part of the British team. Budd, who was born in South Africa and aged 17 at the time of the race, was later accused of tripping her up. The crowd's hostile reaction after Decker's fall caused Budd, who famously ran barefoot and had been winning the race, to finish seventh. Decker, who had fallen into the infield grass clutching her right thigh, was carried from the track in tears. Budd had already received international attention after her application for British citizenship was fast-tracked earlier in 1984, in time for her to compete at the Los Angeles games. As a South African, Budd would have been ineligible to compete as the country had been banned from international sport because of its policy of apartheid.

It is currently 85,884 - but it is not rising as quickly as predicted a year ago, when the last official population projections were published. It was estimated then that by June this year the population would be between 87,100 and 88,900.  In fact it was around 86,000, which may have given ministers more confidence that their plans can be achieved. The projections said that by 2020 the population could be anything between 81,400 and 98,900, with the \"central scenario\" - the most likely - suggesting it would be 90,200. If the population did edge towards the upper estimates it would be extremely hard for the government's plans to work. They would need to build thousands of extra places, as well as replacing old ones. New prison population forecasts are due to be published this month. As for the closures, it's long been speculated that Pentonville, in north London, might be closed. It was heavily criticised by inspectors earlier this year. Other possible candidates for closure in London include Wormwood Scrubs, Brixton and Wandsworth. Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool are all old prisons, which are known to be very expensive to run. Dartmoor Prison has already been earmarked for closure. As well as Reading - which the Treasury has said will be first to be sold - several jails are currently unused and could also be sold off. They include Dover, which was until recently an immigration removal centre, and Downview Prison, in Surrey, which was a women's prison. But building prisons takes many years. Plans for a new prison in north Wales were first made public in January 2013, but the proposals were under consideration before that. The new jail, in Wrexham, is not due to open until 2017.

He reached his target within days, and now has over 400,000 hits on YouTube. He came to the out-of-court settlement with a host of firms whose software he pirated after being convicted by a Czech court. In return, they agreed not to sue him. The 30-year-old was also given a three-year suspended sentence. The criminal court decided that any financial penalty would have to be decided either in civil proceedings or out of court. The firms, which included Microsoft, HBO Europe, Sony Music and 20th Century Fox, estimated that the financial damage amounted to thousands of pounds, with Microsoft alone valuing its losses at 5.7m Czech Crowns (?¡ê148,000). But the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represented Microsoft, acknowledged that Jakub could not pay that sum. Instead, the companies said they would be happy to receive only a small payment and his co-operation in the production of the video. In order for the firms' promise not to sue to be valid, they said, the video would have to be viewed at least 200,000 times within two months of its publication this week. A spokesman for the BSA told the BBC that the stipulation was to ensure that Jakub would help share it as widely as possible. But, if the video had not reached the target, the spokesman said that - \"in theory\" - the firms would have grounds to bring a civil case for damages. A Czech public relations firm, working for the BSA, set up a website in Jakub's name to host the video. A message from Jakub on the site, written in Czech, read: \"I thought I was not doing anything wrong. I thought it did not hurt the big companiesa€| I was convinced that I was too small a fish.\" In the video, Jakub, who, the BSA accepted, did not pirate the software for financial gain, warned other small-time pirates they too could be caught. Jakub reportedly put copies of Microsoft Windows 7 and 8, as well as other content, on filesharing sites. The film, in which Jakub plays himself, has so far been watched more than 400,000 times.

However, on 25 September 1975, a bomb was placed outside the pub. Only by chance did 19-year-old Sapper David Campbell see the device enabling him to raise the alarm. In the minutes before the explosion, police were called, the pub was cleared, nearby homes were evacuated and roads were sealed off. Residents then heard \"an almighty boom\". Seconds later, Mr Wooster saw glass, wood and debris everywhere, with his destroyed car against the neighbouring prison wall. He remembers a scene of \"absolute devastation\". But, despite a series of false alarms in the months beforehand, Mr Wooster was not unduly alarmed. \"We were scared, of course we were scared. But, being a little pub we only had one door open and we knew all the customers,\" he said. \"So, if anyone came in we would be on them straight away, especially if they were carrying a bag or anything. \"We felt quite happy that no-one was going to come in here and do anything, but as it turned out they didn't have to.\" Because of Mr Campbell's actions, no-one was killed, but two police officers were injured. One of them, Mick Gray, was going to warn a driver and a pedestrian when the bomb went off. \"I just had this voice in my head say 'run',\" he explained. \"I was facing that way and I just ran and I'd only gone a few yards when I was picked up and blown over and all this stuff came at me at the same time.\" The uniform he wore that night is covered in holes where shrapnel penetrated his body. A notebook in his top pocket was the only thing that stopped a shard of metal entering his chest. There were about 20 people in the pub that night. Mr Campbell said it was pure chance he spotted the device, having gone outside to look for someone who had left their coat in the pub. Having served in Northern Ireland, his suspicions were immediately raised on seeing a bag next to the landlord's car. As the area was cleared, police officers shone torches through the gap at the end of the holdall zip and saw batteries, a clock and wires. The bombers were eventually caught after a tip-off, which led to an armed siege in Balcombe Street, London.

{"id": 382, "article": "The council tax has not gone up in Scotland since 2007. The council tax freeze was initially an interim measure but became a major Scottish government policy. In recent years, many councils complained the freeze was adding to the pressure on their finances and leading to more cuts. Meanwhile a more philosophical point was being debated too - whether councils should have more control over their finances, with a greater suite of financial powers. From next April councils will have the power to raise the council tax for everyone by up to 3% again. People in higher band homes - around a quarter of residents -  will automatically see their bills rise because of changes to the band system. All Band E, F, G and H bills will rise but what about everyone else's? Given how some councils have complained about the pressure on their budgets, you might imagine that it would go without saying that all 32 local authorities would put up council tax. Well think again. So far only two have confirmed their intentions - Borders and South Lanarkshire. And in South Lanarkshire's case, the Labour-run council said they intended to keep the freeze for another year. A number of factors will come into the equation as councillors work through their options . For a start the council tax makes up a relatively small proportion of a typical council's finances - around 15%. In some cases, even putting up the council tax by the full 3% would add a relatively modest amount to a council's budget. In the case of Scottish Borders, the rise will only put around ?¡ê1.5m extra into the kitty. Nationally, about ?¡ê70m would be raised if every council opted for a 3% rise. After a 10 year freeze, only those on the tightest incomes would feel much of an impact from a 3% rise - in the Borders, a Band D bill will rise by barely ?¡ê3.25 a month. But this rise - plus the changes to the bands - could mean a more significant increase for people in the more highly banded homes. Yet, most councils are still facing up to cuts and savings. The overall amount of money they will be getting straight from the Scottish government to spend at their discretion is being cut although the government argues there will be more money available for local services overall. The exact figures vary from area to area but the nightmare scenario for some councils is that they will be asking people to pay more in council tax but still offer them fewer local services. \"Pay more, get less\" is hardly a vote-winner, weeks before May's council elections. A council which manages to hold the council tax freeze could present a number of arguments to justify the move: But a further freeze is not without its risks too: The council tax was a hybrid of the old domestic rates system and the hugely controversial community charge or poll tax - the system used from 1989 until 1993. Supporters of the poll tax or community charge argued that the flat rate charge made it easier for voters to weigh up how efficient their council was. That principal of simple accountability was carried over into the council tax in a more subtle form - a bill payer can easily look at their bill and compare the local charge in their band to the fee levied by other councils. From that they may wish to conclude that their council was more or less efficiently run than another. At a guess, the likelihood is only a minority of councils will freeze the council tax again - while some may opt for a rise of less than 3%. But the fact that these options are even a realistic possibility for debate in some areas is hugely significant and will colour the debate on local services ahead of the council elections. The power to put up council tax is one thing. Using that power is quite another.", "question": "Scottish councils will now find it much easier to put up the council tax but do not assume your bill will rise .

Reviews have been positive for The Night Manager, starring Tom Hiddleston as the enigmatic Jonathan Pine, who goes undercover to try to expose the activities of billionaire arms dealer Richard Roper, played by Hugh Laurie. The Daily Telegraph called it \"a superb climax\",  while pointing out that the ending, in which Roper loses his money and his liberty, differed from the novel's, in which \"Corky survived to expose Pine and thrash him to a pulp for days on end\".

That military promotion list was the North Korean leader's major public debut, a sign that he was the anointed one. Very little is really known about his fellow general Mr Hyon, but one clear sign of his growing influence in the final years of Kim Jong-il's rule was that he served on the committee for Kim Jong-il's funeral in December 2011. He rose to sudden prominence when he replaced the powerful former army chief, Ri Yong-ho in the summer of 2012.  Analysts said at the time that the reshuffle appeared to be an attempt by Kim Jong-un to stamp his authority on the army. But it is unclear exactly why Mr Hyon has now been purged like this, as he only made the transition into this position of defence minister in June 2014. Since then, there has been little coverage that would suggest a trajectory out of the ordinary and there is little in his background that provide clues to his downfall. According to DPRK state media, Hyon Yong-chol was born in January 1949 in North Hamgyo'ng Province and joined the military in March 1966.

{"id": 403, "article": "Thousands of living men convicted over consensual same-sex relationships will also be eligible for the pardon. Lib Dem peer Lord Sharkey, who proposed the amendment to the Policing and Crimes Bill, said it was \"momentous\". It follows the pardoning of World War Two code-breaker Alan Turing for gross indecency in 2013. Under the amendment - dubbed \"Turing law\" - deceased people who were convicted of sexual acts that are no longer deemed criminal will receive an automatic pardon. Anyone living who has been convicted of such offences could already apply through the Home Office to have the offence wiped from their criminal records. But now, if the Home Office agrees that the offence is no longer an offence under current law, they will automatically be pardoned. Justice Minister Sam Gyimah said it was \"hugely important that we pardon people convicted of historical sexual offences who would be innocent of any crime today\". Lord Sharkey said he understood why some people may not want a pardon, or may \"feel that it's wrong\". But, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, \"a pardon is probably the best way of acknowledging the real harm done by the unjust and cruel homophobic laws, which thankfully we've now repealed. And I do hope that a lot of people will feel exactly the same way\". He said of the 65,000 men convicted under the laws, 15,000 are still alive. George Montague was convicted in 1974 of gross indecency with a man. He says he wants an apology - not a pardon. \"To accept a pardon means you accept that you were guilty. I was not guilty of anything. I was only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" he told BBC Newsnight. \"I think it was wrong to give Alan Turing - one of the heroes of my life - a pardon. \"What was he guilty of? He was guilty of the same as what they called me guilty of - being born only able to fall in love with another man.\" He added: \"If I get an apology, I will not need a pardon.\" He added that there \"never should have been an offence of gross indecency\". \"It didn't apply to heterosexuals. Heterosexuals could do what they liked, in the doorways, in passageways, the back of their car. \"It only applied to gay men. That's not right, surely?\" The Sexual Offences Act decriminalised private homosexual acts between men aged over 21 in England and Wales, in 1967. The law was not changed in Scotland until 1980, or in Northern Ireland until 1982. Announcing the new plan, Mr Gyimah said the government would support Lord Sharkey's amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill - which would apply to England and Wales, but not Scotland and Northern Ireland as the Justice Department does not cover devolved administrations. In 2013, the posthumous royal pardoning of Turing led to calls for wider pardons, and the launch of a petition in 2015. The petition gathered almost 640,000 signatories, including the actors Stephen Fry and Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Turing in the film about the enigma code, The Imitation Game. The charity Stonewall, which campaigns for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, said it has begun discussions with the Scottish government to allow similar procedures to be introduced in Scotland. In Northern Ireland, the Rainbow Project, also a charity and campaign group, met with the justice minister in August to discuss the law around historical convictions. Turing, the Bletchley Park code-breaker, was convicted in 1952 of gross indecency with a 19-year-old man. He was later chemically castrated and died in 1954 after poisoning himself with cyanide. His pardon, almost 60 years later, followed a Private Member's Bill introduced by Lord Sharkey. The Lib Dem peer said it was \"a momentous day for thousands of families up and down the UK\". He said: \"It is a wonderful thing that we have been able to build on the pardon granted to Alan Turing during the coalition.\" Turing's great niece Rachel Barnes said the moment Turing's family heard he was to receive a pardon was \"absolutely tremendous\". She told the Today programme: \"Alan Turing just so, so deserves this. To think that this is the man who cracked the enigma code and saved countless of millions of lives during World War Two and to think of the treatments that he went through at the hands of the government in 1952 is still unbelievable to us.\" She said that the family has always highlighted his achievements rather than the fact he was a gay man. She added: \"Because we shouldn't be thinking about his sexuality, we should really be focusing on the successes of this incredible man in history who has done so much for the country and for the world\". The government has said it will not be supporting a separate Private Member's Bill on the subject - introduced by SNP MP John Nicolson - which is set to be debated on Friday. Mr Nicolson, the MP for East Dunbartonshire, has proposed a blanket pardon for those still living, without the need to apply for their criminal records to be cleared by the Home Office. Mr Gyimah said such a move could see people claiming pardons for acts that are still illegal. \"This would cause an extraordinary and unnecessary amount of distress to victims,\" he added. Paul Twocock from Stonewall welcomed the announcement but said it supported Mr Nicolson's Private Member's Bill. Mr Twocock said the bill \"explicitly\" excluded pardoning anyone convicted of offences that would still be illegal today, including non-consensual sex and sex with someone under 16.", "question": "Gay and bisexual men convicted of now - @placeholder sexual offences in England and Wales are to receive posthumous pardons , the government has announced .", "option_0": "known", "option_1": "affected", "option_2": "enhancing", "option_3": "abolished", "option_4": "offered"}

He has housed dozens of migrants in caravans on his farm in the Roya valley, in south-east France. In February he received a suspended 3,000 euro (¡ê2,700) fine. Prosecutors had sought an eight-month suspended jail term for Herrou, for helping migrants to slip past police after entering from Italy. Outside the court, Herrou told reporters: \"It's the role of a citizen in a democracy to act when the state is failing.\" \"I'd like the judiciary to recognise what's happening on the ground in the Roya valley, recognise these asylum seekers. What am I to do, really? Kick these people out?\" he added. He said he had \"no regrets\" and \"I won't be stopped by threats - quite the opposite\". Herrou has become a symbol of ordinary Europeans who have taken action to aid migrants fleeing war or poverty in the Middle East and Africa. He has housed teenagers from Eritrea and Sudan on his property, reports say. Last month French President Emmanuel Macron described a plan to set up \"hotspots\" in Libya to process asylum seekers, because so many migrants were still \"taking crazy risks\" crossing the Mediterranean. He said nearly a million migrants were currently in camps in Libya, hoping to reach Europe, but were not eligible for asylum. Most of the migrants rescued from overcrowded boats and brought to Italy this year have been sub-Saharan Africans. Many have suffered violence, including rape, but they do not qualify for asylum if they are not victims of persecution. The UN refugee agency UNHCR says nearly 118,000 have reached southern Europe by sea so far this year, more than 96,500 of whom came ashore in Italy. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

President Castro for his part said that now that diplomatic ties were back in place, the overall normalisation of relations \"will only be achieved with the end of the economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba\".

The authority's provisional 2015-16 budget had included ¡ê1.5m cuts to bus services, and reduced funding for the Citizens' Advice Bureau. Homeless shelters faced possible closure under the plans, and the removal of other funding could have forced some scout groups to shut down. Liberal Democrat leader, Douglas McCall, accused council leaders of refusing to listen to public concerns or engage with opposition parties. He described their approach to a public consultation as \"arrogant\". However, Mr Marland said a record consultation response showed the authority was listening. \"What we couldn't do is persuade enough opposition politicians that what we were doing was ultimately right,\" he said. Former Conservative group leader Andrew Geary said his party had predicted savings for five years and put forward a \"clear strategy\" for delivering them when it was in control. \"You simply can't amend something that is not built on a solid foundation and this budget is built on the sand and it will collapse and it won't deliver.\" The authority is set to meet again next week to discuss the revised proposals. Analysis Paul Scoins, Political reporter, BBC Three Counties After the political grandstanding comes the negotiation. Concessions will be made but the key sticking point of provision for homeless people will remain a subject for debate. The council will then need to agree that budget and, if they fail, the government will step in and act, most likely freezing the budget in its current state. More than ¡ê90m needs to be saved over the next few years and Labour says difficult decisions are inevitable.

The children are trying to annul the marriage on grounds of incapacity - though a fourth is refusing to join the action and has not commented. Ms Monteiro was hired by Mr Marcolino's wife 30 years ago, two years before she died. According to Manuel Marcolino de Jesus, one of three children who have filed the lawsuit, his father's health has sharply deteriorated over the past few years. His father has made several emergency trips to the local hospital, where his files say he suffers dementia and is totally dependent, Manuel Marcolino said. \"They have lived in [Ms Monteiro's] house since he became incapable five years ago, and that is when she started to take over everything,\" he told Portugal's CM Jornal. \"Since then, more than €319,000 has gone missing from one [bank] account and more than €200,000 from another,\" he alleged.

It is a key ally of the US and, together with Egypt, one of only two Arab nations to have made peace with Israel. The desert kingdom emerged out of the post-World War I division of the Middle East by Britain and France. The population at that time was largely made up of tribes which had taken part in the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Today, those original inhabitants - known as East Bank Jordanians - are outnumbered by the descendants of Palestinian refugees from Israel and the West Bank. Country profiles by BBC Monitoring The first ruler of Jordan, the Hashemite Abdullah I, was born in Mecca and played a leading role in the Great Arab Revolt. The death in February 1999 of King Hussein, who ruled for 46 years, left Jordan still struggling for economic and social survival, as well as regional peace. His son, Abdullah II faces the task of maintaining stability while accommodating calls for reform. A blueprint for long-term political, economic and social change - known as the National Agenda - has yet to be implemented, and the Arab Spring popular revolts across the region found some resonance in street protests. Jordan's reputation as one of the region's safest countries was dealt a blow in late 2005 when dozens of people were killed in suicide bomb attacks on hotels in the capital. Iraq-based Islamic militants claimed responsibility. The king said Jordan had been targeted because of its location and its stances. The civil war in neighbouring Syria has seen Jordan play host to some 600,000 Syrian refugees, while the resurgence of Islamic militancy in Iraq also presents security challenges for Amman. Unlike Arab states to the south and east, Jordan has no oil of its own. Its resources are limited to phosphates and agricultural produce. The economy depends largely on services, tourism and foreign aid, of which the US is the main provider. Jordan prides itself on its health service, one of the best in the region.

Kezia Dugdale, Scottish Labour's deputy leader, was invited by the first minister to contemplate her own party's record in such matters.  Cast your mind back, she was challenged, to the first two Holyrood administrations which Labour led. Slightly plaintively, Ms Dugdale replied:  \"I was still at school in 1999.\" Well, gee, thanks, Kez.  Rub it in, why don't you? To be fair, her point was not to emphasise her relative youth but to argue that the political focus should be on the here and now. Harking back to Labour's record might, she said, comfort SNP backbenchers but it would provide minimal succour to anyone who slept on a trolley in hospital last night. Ms Sturgeon tried again.  She was, she insisted, talking about today, talking about her government's record.  Only, she argued, it was instructive to contrast it with what went before.  There were, for example, three times as many A&E consultants as under Labour, she said. The discussions with Ruth Davidson of the Tories also featured a double focus.  The topic was the North Sea oil industry.  The falling oil price, said Ms Davidson, was presenting a big challenge to the industry. However, Ms Davidson was also keen to revert to the past.  Imagine, she said, if Scotland had opted for independence.  There would have been, she averred, a black hole in Scotland's accounts to the tune of ?¡ê18.6bn because of declining duties from the North Sea. Ms Sturgeon insisted that Scotland would be better off taking command of her own resources - and offered an historic swipe of her own, accusing successive Labour and Conservative administrations of squandering Scotland's oil wealth. Ms Davidson then brandished today's edition of The Courier which, together with its sister paper the P&J, featured an interview with Alex Salmond in which he argued that Scotland might press for full control of the economy, with only defence and foreign affairs reserved to Westminster, should there be a substantial phalanx of SNP MPs after May's General Election. That meant, said Ms Davidson, \"tearing up\" the stable tax regime which had benefited the North Sea sector.  Pausing for a moment to snort, faintly, at the thought of tax stability under the UK structure, Ms Sturgeon said:  \"Alex Salmond backs independence?

{"id": 467, "article": "The summit, chaired by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, brought tree health experts together with government and industry officials. Dieback has been confirmed at 115 sites; woods in Norfolk, Kent, Suffolk and Essex are among the worst affected. On Tuesday the disease was reported at seven sites in Scotland. Some scientists warn the outbreak has the potential to devastate the UK's population of 80 million ash trees. The summit considered the findings of a nationwide survey carried out by 500 Forestry Commission staff. The data collected from 2,500 10km x 10km areas aimed to identify how far the disease has spread, and formed the basis of discussions on what steps need to be taken to deal with the dieback outbreak. Dieback, caused by the Chalara fraxinea fungus, was first recorded in eastern Europe in 1992 and spread over two decades to infect most of the continent. The key ideas to tackle Chalara identified at the summit, include: These, together with other proposals will be considered for possible inclusion in a Chalara action plan to be published on Friday 9 November. The first confirmed case in the UK was recorded at a nursery in Buckinghamshire back in March 2012. A ban on ash imports and the movement of trees from areas with confirmed cases of dieback came into force on 29 October, just days after government scientists confirmed that the disease had reached the UK's natural environment - at sites in East Anglia. By Mark KinverEnvironment reporter, BBC News Known as the common or European ash, the tree - the UK's only native ash species - is scientifically known as Fraxinus excelsior. It is the UK's third most abundant species of broadleaf tree (after oak and birch), covering 129,000 hectares of woodland. Ash is deemed to be a very important species within the UK's hedgerows and accounts for about for about 10% of the nation's estimated 123 million \"non-woodland\" trees. The common ash is a large deciduous tree that can reach heights in excess of 40 metres (130ft). It can live up to 400 years but coppiced trees can live for centuries longer. The species is wind-pollinated, and the seeds (known as keys) are primarily dispersed by the wind. As the species is long-lived, it is important for wildlife. It supports specialist deadwood species such as the lesser stag beetle and hole-nesting birds including owls and woodpeckers. Ash woodlands have light, open canopies, so are an important habitat for flora such as bluebells and ramsoms. Birds such as bullfinches feed on the trees' seeds. Also, ash provides an important habitat for more than a quarter of Britain's lichen, including nearly 14% of the nationally rare/scarce species. Upland mixed ash woodlands are listed as a priority habitat under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. Farming Today: Ash dieback Researchers said the affected trees in woodlands in Norfolk and Suffolk were likely to have become infected as a result of coming into contact with Chalara fraxinea spores that had been blown over from mainland Europe. The majority of confirmed cases have been recorded at nurseries or sites where young ash trees had been recently planted. The Forestry Commission has issued guidance on how to identify the disease. The Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) has been critical of the government, saying it first alerted officials of the threat back in 2009. On Monday, a nursery forced to destroy 50,000 ash trees after the disease was found in its tree stock said it was considering taking legal action against the government for failing to block imports sooner. The official spokesman for the prime minister said the issue of compensating affected horticultural businesses would be \"dealt with ultimately by the courts\". A Defra spokesman told BBC News that the decision to convene a Cobra meeting last week and hold Wednesday's emergency summit on Chalara ash dieback was to show that the government wanted to take action \"and is taking the matter very seriously\". Woodland Trust policy director Hilary Allison, who attended the summit, said the discovery of dieback in UK woodlands was very worrying. \"Unfortunately, it is often the case that until a tragedy such as ash dieback becomes a reality, it is very difficult to impress upon people the importance of protecting the UK's trees and the need to enforce stricter controls to prevent new pests and diseases entering the country,\" she told BBC News. She added: \"The Woodland Trust is pleased that Defra has been listening to its call for an emergency summit on ash dieback, but we want to stress that this situation only serves to highlight the consequences of leaving decisions affecting the security of our woodland to the 11th hour.\"", "question": "A summit on ash dieback has proposed @placeholder on newly planted trees and better surveillance to tackle the disease .", "option_0": "imposed", "option_1": "relied", "option_2": "focusing", "option_3": "boasted", "option_4": "flourished"}

Djibouti's location is the main economic asset of a country that is mostly barren. The capital, Djibouti city, handles Ethiopian imports and exports. Its transport facilities are used by several landlocked African countries to fly in their goods for re-export. This earns Djibouti much-needed transit taxes and harbour fees. After independence from France in 1977, Djibouti was left with a government which enjoyed a balance between the two main ethnic groups, the Issa of Somali origin and the Afar of Ethiopian origin.

Afar resentment erupted into a civil war in the early 1990s, and though Mr Gouled, under French pressure, introduced a limited multi-party system in 1992, the rebels from the Afar party, the Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy (Frud), were excluded. Thus, Mr Gouled's Popular Rally for Progress party won every seat and the war went on. It ended in 1994 with a power-sharing deal which brought the main faction of Frud into government. A splinter, radical faction continued to fight until 2000, when it too signed a peace deal with the government of Gouled's successor, Ismael Omar Guelleh.

The other two dismissals were less controversial, Roberto committing a daft foul when already on a caution, just as Aleix Vidal was being readied to replace the right-back on 57 minutes. Carrasco's second clumsy foul 12 minutes later was similarly ill-advised, opening up the game and leaving Atletico vulnerable to a Barcelona side previously in retreat. Yet even with Carrasco's dismissal, the visitors will feel they squandered plenty of clear opportunities to take Barcelona to extra time or even completely overturn the 2-1 first-leg deficit. They dominated the early stages, playing with an intensity that rattled the hosts, and Carrasco and Savic both missed decent chances before keeper Miguel Angel Moya parried Messi's effort straight into Suarez's path for the opener. Barcelona were then able to slow the pace of the game to suit their style, with Atletico unable to trouble them for long periods before a remarkable final half-hour. Gameiro struck a poor penalty attempt against the bar, before tapping in Griezmann's squared pass for the equaliser minutes later. And although Atletico will point to the incorrect decision to rule out Griezmann's fine finish, Barcelona ultimately showed enough resolve to progress as they attempt to win a third straight Copa del Rey.", "question": "Luis Suarez scored and was sent off as nine - man Barcelona held on to reach the Copa del Rey final with a thrilling @placeholder victory over 10 - man Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp .", "option_0": "aggregate", "option_1": "upset", "option_2": "comeback", "option_3": "major", "option_4": "special"}

He added that had it been on the agenda it is unlikely it would have been resolved. Mr Straw was giving evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. The committee is examining the government's role in seeking compensation for IRA victims who suffered because of explosives supplied by Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The  former foreign secretary who was involved in a peace deal with Libya in 2003,  said there was no suggestion the victims of IRA violence were at the back of the queue. \"The issue of compensation for victims of PIRA (Provisional IRA) terrorism was not raised with me, so far as I can recall and I know the Foreign Office can find no record suggesting it was raised,\" he said. \"When you are involved in negotiations of this kind to deal with a very serious and continuing danger that the Gaddafi regime had caused over many years, you have got to make a decision over what you are going to concentrate on. If the issue of PIRA had been raised we would have taken it into account, it was not raised.\" \"Even if we put it on the agenda we didn't believe it should get in the way of the agreement as had we refused an agreement on the WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) agenda with Libyans, it wouldn't have helped the victims of IRA bombings for a second,\" he said. It simply would have meant that Libya would have continued to be dangerous,\" he added. Members of the committee also asked Mr Straw to explain why the families of those killed in the Lockerbie bombing received compensation but those who suffered at the hands of Libyan supplied explosives to the IRA did not. \"Libya under a United Nations Security resolution accepted responsibility for the  Lockerbie attack and agreed to pay compensation,\" he said. \"There was no such  UN Security Council which bonded Libya to pay compensation to the victims of its support for the IRA, that was the difference,\" he said. Mr Straw also revealed that he too had suffered at the hands of the IRA. He told the committee how he had been hit by flying glass when a car bomb exploded outside the Old Bailey in 1973. He added that he later had to sign the release papers for some of those involved in the bombing as part of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations.

{"id": 516, "article": "New rules come in on 1 January, which will reduce compensation to ¡ê75,000 per person, per institution. Previously the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protected savings of up to ¡ê85,000 per account. Joint accounts will see protection cut from ¡ê170,000 to ¡ê150,000. The maximum compensation across the European Union is set at €100,000, and the British level was reduced as a result of the pound gaining strength against the euro. The precise rate was set on 3 July 2015. At the time, one senior Tory MP described the change as \"defective\". Although 95% of savers will still be protected, as many as 2.5 million people may not be, according to the FSCS. It is advising savers who have more than ¡ê75,000 in one account, or in one institution, to move their money if necessary. The situation is further complicated by the fact that some registered banks and building societies operate under more than one brand. So it you had ¡ê75,000 savings with HSBC, for example, any additional savings in First Direct would not be protected, as both banks have a joint licence. Savers using Bank of Scotland and Halifax are in the same position. But Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest - although they are sister banks - are both registered separately. So savers could safely have up to ¡ê75,000 in accounts with both banks. \"While this should be quite simple to navigate, it's made complicated by the fact that FSCS cover is shared between banks that operate under the same licence,\" said Hannah Maundrell, editor in chief of money.co.uk. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) publishes a full list of registered banks, and which brands come under the same umbrella. Under the new rules, savers who have up to ¡ê1m in their accounts temporarily - as a result of selling a house, or being made redundant, for example - are also protected. To receive compensation, they cannot have had that cash in their accounts for more than six months. A further warning comes in relation to some foreign banks which trade in the UK, but are registered within the eurozone, such as Germany's Fidor Bank, or Sweden's Handelsbanken. Handelsbanken confirmed that the level of compensation would depend on the exchange rate at the time. So depending on how much €100,000 is worth in pounds, savers may get more or less than ¡ê75,000 protection. At the time of writing, that amount is worth less than ¡ê74,000. \"With an increasing number of European banks now offering competitive rates, customers need to be aware that not all savings accounts offered in the UK are covered by the UK compensation scheme,\" said Rachel Thrussell, savings insight manager at Moneyfacts.co.uk.", "question": "Millions of savers are being reminded that they may need to move some of their cash , to @placeholder it will be fully protected in the event of their bank going bust .", "option_0": "suggests", "option_1": "prove", "option_2": "prevent", "option_3": "guarantee", "option_4": "confirm"}

It said clinicians and service providers were working \"against the odds\" to address needs. Health Minister Mark Drakeford is attending an event in the Senedd on Tuesday to launch the report. About 1,054 children and young people required palliative care services in Wales in 2014. Of these, it is estimated 10% died during the year. One difficulty identified in the report was that children's palliative care services sometimes came under adult palliative care when decisions were made. The report said much of children's palliative care is not about the final period of life but about helping children and families cope better with a series of conditions which may last many years. The focus on end-of-life care means services are not sufficiently supporting the 90% of children requiring ongoing help, it said. The University of South Wales report, commissioned by Welsh children's hospice Ty Hafan, makes recommendations including giving paediatric palliative care the same status as that for adults. It also calls for a 24/7 telephone advice service for health professionals and to establish child-focused performance measures. Though \"considerable progress\" has been made in recent years, the report claims progress now \"seems to have stalled and needs new impetus\".

About 18,000 people have been besieged since last July. Rights groups say more than 100 people have starved to death. Syria has been engulfed in a bloody conflict between government and rebel forces over the past three years. The ceasefire is said to include the Syrian regime, rebel groups based in Yarmouk and many Palestinian factions, Sana news agency reports. It is not clear when the truce will begin. Previous truces have been broken. Both food and medicine are in scarce supply in Yarmouk and large parts of the suburb lie in utter ruin, the BBC's chief international correspondent Lyse Doucet reports. For the last two weeks, United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has been unable to distribute food because of continued clashes and shelling, our correspondent adds. Yarmouk has become a symbol of suffering in Syria. This once vibrant Palestinian community has been targeted by a punishing government siege, and rivalry among numerous Syrian and Palestinian armed groups. We saw, on the two occasions this year we managed to enter the besieged area, how desperate conditions are. Nearly 18,000 people are struggling to survive, without basic necessities, under constant shelling and sniper fire. On our last visit in May, Syrian military officers told us they expected to reach an agreement soon. UN officials also spoke of possible positive change. It's taken weeks longer than expected.

{"id": 528, "article": "Mutations of the NR5A1 gene were found in a small percentage of infertile men, reports the American Journal of Human Genetics. Scientists from the Pasteur Institute in France and University College London said it could help doctors investigating men with the condition. A UK expert said he hoped that further gene defects could be found. In the majority of cases, doctors can find no cause for male infertility, despite it accounting for up to half of cases in which couples have difficulty conceiving. Male infertility appears to be more common within certain families, and this leads scientists to believe that there may be a genetic root for some cases, but only a handful of gene mutations which might be responsible have actually been found. The latest research looks at a gene already known to be involved in sexual development in both men and women - defects in NR5A1 have been linked to physical defects in the development of the testicles or ovaries. Their findings suggest that, even where there is no physical evidence of a problem, defects in the gene may be hampering the ability to make sperm. They looked at the gene in 315 apparently healthy men who had an unexplained inability to produce sperm.

The former Central Intelligence Agency technical worker is the source of some of the biggest information leaks in US history. A number of US allies, including Germany, have already expressed anger over Snowden-based spying allegations. The Spiegel article claims that the NSA ( National Security Agency) and the UK's GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters) are able to eavesdrop on telecom companies such as Deutsche Telekom, Netcologne, Stellar and Cetel. The Treasure Map programme, which the newspaper calls \"the Google Earth of the Internet,\" is said to give the agencies access to data about the network structure and also through individual routers to subscribers' personal devices. Der Spiegel warns that the information obtained could be used for planning sophisticated cyber-attacks. The Treasure map was first mentioned last year by the New York Times, which says the programme collects Wifi network and geo-location data, as well as between 30 and 50 million unique internet provider addresses a€¡± information that can reveal the owner and location of a computer or mobile device.

It also noted that all parties named in the article had been given a right of reply prior to publication, and readers had the opportunity to respond in subsequent issues.

But it is controversial because in such cases, there is no need to prove a member of the group intended to kill. Campaigners say up to 600 people are serving life for murder as a result of unjust joint enterprise convictions. To be guilty of murder, the prosecution need only show that someone foresaw the person they were with \"might\" kill or inflict serious harm, said BBC legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman. He said the \"unprecedented\" hearing will \"scrutinise the contentious 'foresight' test at the heart of joint enterprise, and could change it\". Our correspondent said: \"The test at the heart of joint enterprise is one of foresight and possibility, and many believe that lowers the burden on the prosecution and allows those who are simply too morally remote from the crime, bit-part players or not even players at all, to be swept up in a prosecution and convicted on the basis that they were all 'in it together'. \"If the test is passed and a person is convicted of murder, they will receive the mandatory life sentence.\" Concern about the use of joint enterprise has also been raised in the past by former President of the Supreme Court Lord Phillips, who said it is \"capable of producing injustice, undoubtedly\". In December 2014, the House of Commons Justice Committee called for an urgent review into its use to prevent overcharging.  Its report noted that a large proportion of those convicted were young black and mixed race men.

Teachers allowed off the 'naughty step' However, the education minister has decided against re-introducing a common, department-run 11-plus test, admitting there was not enough political support to bring back an official exam. \"I have been resolutely supportive of academic selection and, indeed,  the right of people to have academic selection,\" Mr Weir told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. \"This is actually about providing freedom to schools.

However, Mr Weir said no school would be \"compelled\" to carry out the preparation. The 11-plus exam, which used to determine entry into grammar schools, was abolished in 2008. Unofficial exams have been used by many grammar schools to decide which pupils to admit since then, but primary schools were not allowed to help pupils to prepare for those. Previous departmental guidance said that primary schools \"should not facilitate unregulated entrance test arrangements in any way\". They were therefore prohibited from \"supplying support materials, carrying out any preparation for unregulated tests during core teaching hours, offering afternoon coaching in exam technique, or providing familiarisation with a test environment\". Mr Weir has now changed that, meaning primary schools can help pupils prepare for the AQE and GL Assessment tests if they wish.

Noye, who is in Wayland Prison, Norfolk, was due to be granted hearings earlier this year but they were cancelled. In February, the victim's mother, Toni Cameron, described Noye as a lifelong \"villain\" who should never be let out of jail. \"We just feel that it's not fair that he should come out and have parole. He's a villain and he always has been. His whole life is criminality,\" she said. Noye was involved in the ¡ê26m Brinks Mat raid in 1983 - one of the UK's biggest robberies - when six armed men posed as security guards and stole 6,800 gold bars from a warehouse at Heathrow Airport. During the police investigation in 1985, Noye stabbed to death undercover officer Det Con John Fordham in the grounds of his mansion in West Kingsdown, Kent. He admitted killing the detective in self-defence when he found him in shrubbery at his home. Noye was cleared of murder but jailed for 14 years for handling stolen bullion. Two years after his release, he murdered Mr Cameron during the M25 slip road fight with a knife he kept in his car.

Many of the first settlers were convicts, but freemen started to arrive in increasing numbers after the discovery of gold in the mid-19th century. Aboriginal Australians, who had inhabited the continent for tens of thousands of years prior to British colonisation, numbered a few hundred thousand. Two centuries of discrimination and expropriation cut their population drastically, and now they make up less than 3% of Australia's approximately 23 million people. Australia's politicians at first looked to Europe and the US in foreign policy, but in the past 20 years or so they have made East Asia the priority, in particular Indonesia and China. The government formally apologised in 2008 for the past wrongs committed against the indigenous Australians, who still suffer from high rates of unemployment, imprisonment and drug abuse. Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring The gradual dismantling of the \"White Australia\" immigration policy in the decades after World War II heralded an increase in the number of non-European arrivals, and migration remains a politically-sensitive issue. Originally composed of six separate colonies of the British Empire, Australia's path to independent statehood began with the formation of a federal state in 1901 and was largely complete by World War II. The last few remaining constitutional links with the United Kingdom were severed in 1986, although Australia remains part of the Commonwealth, and The Queen is the head of state, represented by a governor-general. The future of the monarchy is a recurring issue in politics. In a 1999 referendum nearly 55% of Australians voted against becoming a republic.

HM Revenue & Customs said the data it gleaned would be compared with its existing computerised records for income tax paid under self-assessment or PAYE, tax credits and national insurance. \"It shines a light onto previously hidden relationships, uncovering anomalies between such elements as bank interest, property income and lifestyle indicators before homing in on unexplained inconsistencies,\" an HMRC spokesman said.

Below are some of the key dates from the investigations into both men published in the Intelligence and Security Committee's report. May 2008: First identified by MI5. An \"investigative record\" was opened. 2009-10: Occasional indirect coverage of Adebolajo as a result of his contact with another person of interest to MI5. 21 November 2010: Arrested in Kenya by Kenyan authorities with a group of other individuals, assessed to have been attempting to travel to Somalia to join Islamist militant group al-Shabab. MI5 opened a trace on him when informed of the arrest the next day. 25 November 2010: Adebolajo arrived back in the UK, having left Kenya voluntarily, and was interviewed by SO15 - the Met Police's counter terrorism unit - under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. April 2011: Operation created to focus on Adebolajo's involvement in extremist activity. Initial inquiries made to confirm where he was living. 14 April 2011: MI5 linked Adebolajo to a GCHQ report from January 2010 which listed the historic contacts (between 2008 and 2009) of an individual of interest who later became a high profile and senior figure from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The content of this communication was not sought. 9 May 2011: Urgent application made for further \"intrusive\" coverage, such as intercepting phone calls, against Adebolajo. 21 July 2011: Surveillance indicated that Adebolajo had met a subject of interest investigated for radicalising UK-based individuals and facilitating their travel overseas. August 2011: MI5 passed intelligence to the police regarding Adebolajo's possible intention to be involved in the London riots. In the event, Adebolajo was not arrested. MI5 also contacted the National Terrorist Financial Investigative Unit, suspecting Adebolajo was engaged in fraudulent activity. No evidence of fraud was discovered. September 2011 - October 2012: MI5 commissioned an internal report to summarise what was known about Adebolajo's activities. This noted there was no indication he was currently involved in extremist activities. MI5 cancelled their coverage and planned to close the investigation. November 2012 - May 2013: \"Intrusive\" coverage of Adebolajo reinstated. But no security threat was identified, and investigations indicated that Adebolajo was spending most of his time involved in drug dealing. February - April 2013: MI5 notify SO15 of their belief that Adebolajo was involved in drug dealing. They in turn channelled this information to the local police. However, the house number was accidentally omitted and no further action was taken. 11 April 2013: \"Intrusive\" coverage of Adebolajo cancelled. 22 May 2013: Fusilier Lee Rigby murdered. August 2011: Adebowale identified by GCHQ as having shown an interest in extremist material online. April 2012: An \"investigative record\" is opened. Telephone analysis showed that Adebowale had been in contact with subjects of interest. Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) and the Welsh Extremism and Counter-Terrorism Unit conducted enquiries into Adebowale. No trace of current involvement in extremist activity was found. June 2012: MI5 closed its investigation into Adebowale. It assessed he did not pose a current threat to UK national security. September 2012: Adebowale identified by GCHQ as having been referred to as a \"lone wolf\" in monitored online comments. 25 January 2013: Decision to create investigation into Adebowale was endorsed by MI5 management team. January-February 2013: Adebowale's online activity was reviewed and revealed he had been in contact with another person of interest. 13 March 2013: Intelligence indicated Adebowale had sought to disseminate extremist material. This was a possible offence; potential executive action was considered. 19 April 2013: MI5 and SO15 agreed to build further coverage of Adebowale in order to form a better assessment of how to disrupt him and manage any risk. 26 April 2013: Application drafted for further \"intrusive\" techniques against Adebowale. Several revisions to the draft were subsequently discussed and made in order to meet statutory and policy requirements. 21 May 2013: Revised application was approved by a senior manager and MI5's deputy director general. Final draft sent to the Home Office as a routine application. 22 May 2013: Fusilier Lee Rigby murdered.

The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) said a barge ferried the expedition members to the Mawson research station after weather conditions improved. Thirty-one crew members remain onboard to refloat the vessel. The AAD said the refloating process, where the crew will attempt to move the ship off the rocks, would take several hours, and that afterwards the ship would be taken to a nearby sheltered area for inspections. The vessel incurred a small breach in the hull when it ran aground, which the AAD said poses no risk to the ship's stability or to the environment. It added there was no fuel spilled so far. The Aurora Australis left Hobart in Tasmania on 11 January and carried out marine science research around the Kerguelen Plateau, a submerged continent that extends for 2,200km (1,365 miles), before arriving at Mawson on Saturday. It broke free of mooring lines at 09:15 local time (04:15 GMT) on Wednesday, amid winds of more than 130kph (80mph), and ran aground at West Arm in Horseshoe Harbour. It was also scheduled to pick up another group of expedition members from Davis research station. The AAD said on Friday that this group would now be flown to Casey research station, and then flown home in coming days. The Aurora Australis, which is 95m long and weighs 3,911 tonnes, was launched in 1989 and is capable of breaking ice that is up to 1.2m thick.

{"id": 585, "article": "It followed US President Donald Trump's comment, as part of his broad-ranging New York Times interview, that the wife of the Japanese prime minister, Akie Abe, cannot speak any English. When netizens discovered the YouTube video of her giving a speech in English, however, they went on to speculate that she must have pretended to not know the language to avoid having a conversation with Mr Trump. His critics treated her as their hero and American media have taken an intense interest in the story. But the truth may not be as black and white. While the president's remark that she cannot even say \"hello\" may be an exaggeration, being able to read a scripted English speech does not mean that one is capable of having a spontaneous conversation over dinner. Her previous diplomatic encounters have almost always been through an interpreter and when the BBC requested an interview with her in the past, they said she would only accept if it is conducted in Japanese. Responding to the uproar over Mr Trump's re-telling of his encounter with Akie Abe at the G20 summit, Japan's foreign ministry spokesman told the BBC there would be no official comment, as it was a private conversation. \"In the meantime, we acknowledge in that interview that President Trump stated that he enjoyed the evening with her [Mrs Abe], and she is really a lovely woman,\" the ministry added. But Japanese people have been weighing into the debate, and they divide broadly into three camps. The editor of the Huffington Post Japan, Tomoko Nagano, asked if Mr Trump could say hello in Japanese while one Twitter user, @cevicherohack, said he finds it annoying that English speakers assume everyone should be able to speak their language. @hidezumi thought the president was impolite not to have led the conversation while New York Times reporter Hiroko Tabuchi said the issue may be Mr Trump's conversational skills, not Mrs Abe's. As a non-native English speaker myself, it took me years before feeling comfortable enough to start a conversation at a dinner party. @Riepyan agreed that it is a mistake to assume everyone would be friendly and speak to you in simple English. Japanese media have so far been neutral on the topic and just reported what has been said in American media. It may be partly because she remains a controversial figure, being in the spotlight for her role in the ongoing scandal over nationalistic schools.

{"id": 586, "article": "Large parts of health board and council budgets are being merged in a bid to cut bed-blocking and aid the transition to nursing home care or home care. People with long-term conditions, disabilities and the elderly are expected to see the greatest benefit. The Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act has been described as the most substantial reform to the NHS in a generation. It forces councils and the NHS to work together to provide more streamlined services. The two organisations have to decide which one of them is going to take the lead in decision-making, or delegate those decisions to a separate body. There is some evidence that co-ordinating care can have a significant effect on the quality of life of frail older people and people with long-term conditions. It is also associated with lower costs. The Scottish government hopes it will ease the pressure on hospitals by speeding up the journey of patients. In order to drive improvements, a new target is being set for delayed discharges. From 1 April, no-one should wait more than 14 days to be discharged from hospital into more appropriate care. The current target is four weeks. In March it was announced that health and social care partnerships would be piloted in 29 areas in England, although so far only Greater Manchester has gone as far pooling its entire health and care budget. In Scotland, it is estimated that at least 60% of health board budgets and 72% of local authority social care budgets will be handed over to the new \"integration authorities\". In Wales an \"integrated care framework\" was published by the government last year, promising closer working between local government, health, housing and the voluntary sector. Northern Ireland has had an integrated health and social care system since the early 1970s with its five health and social care trusts. The Highlands of Scotland have had merged health and social care budgets since 2012. The NHS became the lead agency for adult care, while the council took over responsibility for children's services. However, it has not proved a magic bullet. NHS Highland experienced difficulties with blocked beds this winter, which was blamed on a lack of care home places and support packages for elderly patients to return home. Last year, just under 150, 000 people received some form of social care at home.

The news that Leicester's unit may have turned down kidneys that might have been used locally, will not sit well with people waiting for that phone call. People die waiting for a kidney. The decision on whether or not to accept an organ for transplant can be a tricky one for surgeons and sometimes they might think it's worth waiting for a better match. The review team visited last week to speak to staff, examine paperwork and patients' outcomes. It found no patients had been harmed, the trust said, but it raised questions about the \"policies, processes and guidelines\" and also the way the team worked together. Andrew Furlong, the trust's deputy medical director, said it was \"incredibly disappointing\". He added: \"We have decided to pause the surgery because for this, or any other kind of complex surgical procedure, we have to have cast iron processes, policies and procedures underpinning the surgery itself and good team working between the clinicians, until it can be independently verified that these are in place we would prefer to err on the side of caution.\" The review team will return in two weeks and will make further recommendations including whether kidney transplants should resume. Three patients were due to have live transplants in the next two weeks with a further four estimated to receive kidneys from dead donors. These may all now move to Nottingham.

The white-ball teams, led by Eoin Morgan, play three one-day internationals and three Twenty20s, the last of which is on 1 February.

The opening batsman was sacked as one-day captain in 2015, but is unlikely to face a similar situation if he wishes to remain as Test skipper. Speculation over how long he might remain as leader first arose before the tour of India, when Cook said he was looking forward to a time when he was no longer captain. Though England gained a creditable draw in the first Test, their performances deteriorated. In the fourth Test they became only the third side to lose by an innings after making 400 or more batting first, a result that sealed a series defeat and after which Cook said he thought vice-captain Joe Root was \"ready\" to lead.

Analysts say the voice appears to be Baghdadi's but this is not verified. Baghdadi's fate has been unclear amid reports of air strikes by the US-led coalition that is opposing IS. The message came as IS advanced to within 2km (1.2 miles) of the Unesco World Heritage site of Palmyra, one of the archaeological jewels of the Middle East. Syria's antiquities chief warned that if IS seized Palmyra it would destroy everything that exists there. The latest message was released by the group's al-Furqan media outlet and appeared on several websites. Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The voice on the audio recording is clear, assured and, in places, almost melodic. If it is indeed, as is claimed, the voice of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, then it will put paid to previous rumours of his death. Since we don't actually see him he could, of course, be physically incapacitated. But the lengthy, 33-minute speech does not sound like one made by someone in failing health. The speaker, who makes continual use of religious quotations, exhorts Muslims around the world to join forces with his group. Most significantly, he mentions the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen which began on 26 March, meaning this recording can be no more than seven weeks old. US government linguistic experts will have doubtless been quick to analyse the voice patterns on the tape to see if they match earlier recordings of Baghdadi when he appeared in vision last year. The speaker says: \"There is no excuse for any Muslim not to migrate to the Islamic State... joining [its fight] is a duty on every Muslim. We are calling on you either to join or carry weapons [to fight] wherever you are.\" He adds: \"Islam was never a religion of peace. Islam is the religion of fighting. No-one should believe that the war that we are waging is the war of the Islamic State. It is the war of all Muslims, but the Islamic State is spearheading it. It is the war of Muslims against infidels.\" IS declared a \"caliphate\" over parts of Iraq and Syria in June 2014. The speaker in the message says: \"There is no might nor honour nor safety nor rights for you except in the shade of the caliphate.\" The speaker also makes references to the recent Saudi-led air campaign against Shia rebels in Yemen, which began on 26 March. He condemns the Saudi royal family and says the conflict in Yemen will lead to the end of its rule. Baghdadi's last message was in November. His only public appearance was to deliver a sermon in Mosul in Iraq after IS took the city last July. An Iraqi interior ministry spokesman said in April that Baghdadi had been seriously wounded in a coalition air strike in March. However, the Pentagon said it had no information on that, and other reports last year of him being injured proved to be inaccurate.

{"id": 602, "article": "They openly admit Europe has lost control of the migrant crisis, and they fear for the future of the European project itself. Certainly, the Schengen agreement - which guarantees freedom of movement and is one of the pillars of European unity - is being widely ignored as fences go up and border controls reappear. On Monday Greece was even warned that it could find itself excluded from the Schengen area if the flow of migrants is not stemmed. But do these leaders really believe the European Union itself is at risk? It strains credibility to believe the single market is at risk and European project could fall apart in months. But there is an element of fear seeping through the corridors of the Berlaymont building in Brussels and the Bundestag in Berlin. At the heart of the crisis, the problem is simple: \"We cannot cope,\" Mr Rutte said, \"with the numbers any longer.\" In 2015, 1.83 million migrants came to Europe, of which 1.1 million sought asylum in Germany. More than 35,000 have crossed from Turkey into Greece since the start of the year. German leaders have repeatedly said migrants are a European problem, but that analysis is not universally shared. Many politicians in Eastern and Central Europe incline to a different script: that Mrs Merkel encouraged large numbers of migrants by essentially laying out a welcome mat. The Germans, according to this narrative, provided the pull factor but are insisting others share the burden of dealing with the crisis. So there are divisions and mistrust. The European Commission believed the answer lay in sharing out the refugees between countries. It was agreed 160,000 migrants would be resettled across Europe. Only 331 have been moved so far. Countries - irritated by majority voting - have simply ignored the plan. Mrs Merkel made a big bet on Turkey: that in exchange for a??3bn and the offer of visa-free travel, Turkey would slow the numbers crossing the narrow straits to Greece. But not all the funds have been forthcoming, and Turkey has frustrated Europe's leaders with its lack of action. In the meantime, countries began implementing their own measures. Hungary built a fence. Germany, Austria,France, Denmark, Sweden and Norway all began introducing checks at their borders. It amounted to a suspension of the Schengen agreement. They insisted the controls were temporary, but they are looking to extend them. Further plans have continued to cascade out of the commission's meetings. There would be a compulsory sharing out of refugees across the EU - even though it has shown little evidence of this working so far. Secondly, Greece and Italy - the two countries where most of the migrants first arrived - would create hotspots, or reception camps, where people would be registered. Those who did not qualify for asylum would be turned around. But in Greece, only one out of five planned camps has been built. And if the migrants are refused asylum, it is unclear which force will physically remove them from Europe and where they will go. German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel hinted aid would be withdrawn from North African countries if they did not take back rejected asylum seekers. Many of Europe's leaders believe it will be impossible to save Schengen if Europe's external borders are not secured allowing potential refugees to be screened and processed and not just waved through to Austria and Germany. But they have lost faith in Greece's ability to do this, so the commission has proposed a European Border and Coast Guard force, which in an emergency could overrule national governments. Such a force would impinge on sovereignty. Arguments are likely to be fierce before it is operational, and it is unclear what would happen if governments objected. Pressure is growing on Greece to cooperate. There is talk of Greece having to leave Schengen if it does not agree to take the border guards, or that the Schengen border could be moved  - maybe to Slovenia - so Greece no longer forms part of the EU's external frontier. But it is not just a case of Greece being awkward. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras fears if Greece starts processing all the migrants and denying some of them asylum, the country could become \"a massive refugee camp\". And if the border moved to a country such as Slovenia, then there too a no-man's land for stranded refugees could develop. In the meantime, countries act unilaterally. Macedonia, on Greece's northern border, is building a 10ft (3m) razor-wire fence. Austria has decided to cap the number of asylum seekers it will accept in 2016, at 37,500. All the time, the pressure grows on Mrs Merkel to cap the number Germany will accept. She continues to refuse. Not only would it be an acceptance her policy had failed - but she fears the refugee problem would be pushed back into Eastern Europe and the Balkans, further undermining the Schengen agreement. The pressure the German chancellor is under was reflected in the words of the German President Joachim Gauck, who said refugee quotas might be \"morally and politically necessary\". Even in the winter months the numbers of migrants has not subsided. Some 2,000 are continuing to arrive each day, which - some of Europe's leaders insist - is unsustainable. What this chapter of events underlines is how difficult it has been to forge a European response to the crisis. It raises questions about German leadership. It reflects the pressure on politicians to look after their own national interests by slowing down migrant numbers. It has exposed divisions between Eastern Europe and the northern countries. It reflects different values, a resistance in the East to embrace a multicultural society they have little experience of. And that clash of values is also evident in Germany, where the Bavarian leader Horst Seehofer - an ally of Mrs Merkel - questions what more refugees will do to the country. \"That is then a different society. And the people don't want Germany or Bavaria to become a different society,\" he said. So what will happen? The answer almost certainly does not lie in the commission's plans. EU countries will have to use their financial power to persuade other countries to take back failed asylum seekers. A huge investment - as the German Finance Minister has suggested - will have to be made in countries such as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon to persuade them to keep people in camps but in much better conditions than they are at present. In the longer term, it will probably require some sort of Marshall plan to prevent people fleeing the countries on the rim of the Mediterranean. It may be that, like Canada, the EU will take only refugee families from Syria, rather than young men. And it may be, as some politicians are suggesting, the EU will have to demonstrate a greater willingness to deport failed seekers of asylum. The EU's immense achievement of helping to sow peace in Europe and spread democracy is not at risk - but the migrant crisis is tearing at the fabric of a community of shared values.", "question": "For the past 10 days , Europe 's leaders have been @placeholder in a bout of gloom .", "option_0": "confirmed", "option_1": "engaged", "option_2": "rediscovered", "option_3": "enveloped", "option_4": "stuck"}

{"id": 604, "article": "So pledges being made this week on fares by the 2016 mayoral contenders are worth examining closely. Mind you, how far such retail offers affect voting intentions is a difficult one. In 2012 Ken Livingstone pledged to cut fares and opinion polling suggested it was popular. But it wasn't enough to return him to City Hall. Yet Boris Johnson was definitely worried by the Livingstone pledge and knew he had to pull out the stops to counter it. It clearly affected his thinking. In 2008 Johnson had promised to deliver consistent annual fare rises of two per cent above inflation to allow TfL's business plan to be fulfilled and maintain levels of investment. He explicitly ruled out stop-go fare decisions. But two years into his second term - and with a general election looming - he and the Conservatives too succumbed. For three years now, fare increases have been pegged to the rate of inflation only. Now Labour's Sadiq Khan is promising a four-year freeze in cash terms - in other words, not even allowing them to go up in line with inflation. He claims this will cost ¡ê450 million a year, which he says will be compensated for by efficiencies and better property deals. Caroline Pidgeon - if Liberal Democrat mayor - would introduce half-price fares before 7.30am at a cost, she estimates, of ¡ê30m a year. The Greens' Sian Berry promises a flat fare and the abolition of zones which, taken together with other measures, would cost about ¡ê260m a year. With all the pledges, the big unknown is how much extra income might be generated from a resultant increase in ridership. The Conservative Zac Goldsmith has said that it is rash to promise fare freezes, not least when the Chancellor is turning off the grant tap - cutting ¡ê2.8bn over the next four years. This will all revive the debate about whether over these last few years Londoners have been paying fairly today for improvements tomorrow. And whether the burden has been shared reasonably - with taxpayers across the country - of  modernizing the transport system of the \"engine-room\" of the UK economy.

Corning said Gorilla Glass 5 could survive more than 80% of drops from as high as 1.6m (5ft). Shattered or cracked screens are the number one cause of smartphone repairs and customer complaints globally. The new glass was tested on rough surfaces - a demo for journalists showed dummy phones being dropped from a height of 1.6m on to a sheet of sandpaper. Some of the phones tested survived over 20 hard drops in the lab. Typically, most phone drops are from between waist and shoulder height. As well as drops, the company said it was twice at good at resisting scratches and other damage compared to what's currently on the market. Device manufacturers are expected to unveil products with the new glass within the next few months. \"We've been working with our closest customers for quite some time now,\" Corning's vice president and general manager John Bayne told the BBC. \"And there's tremendous interest in this product for obvious reasons.\" However, he warned that Corning had no control over eventual smartphone designs, meaning some models could be slightly weaker depending on the manufacture and design of the device. Corning's statistics were based instead on controlled lab conditions. The company would not let the BBC test the glass outside of the lab. Corning's work in specialist glass dates back to 1879, when it produced the glass used in the iconic Edison lightbulb. By 2016, more than 4.5 billion devices use Gorilla Glass, which is created using a technique known as fusion forming. It involves placing the raw materials - sand and \"other inorganic material\" - into a melting pot. It is then transferred to an isopipe, essentially a small trough, which is intentionally overfilled. The melted material spills out over both sides and combines underneath to form the sheet of glass. This technique means there is no human contact needed in creating the glass, eliminating defects and removing the need to treat the glass afterwards.

He added: \"I hope this doesn't become a moment when we turn our back on all of the world's problems.\" Defence Secretary Philip Hammond had told BBC's Newsnight programme that he and the prime minister were \"disappointed\" with the result, saying it would harm Britain's \"special relationship\" with Washington. But he said he did not expect Britain's decision to \"stop any action\" by other countries. Labour leader Ed Miliband said on Friday that the House of Commons had spoken \"for the people of Britain\". \"People are deeply concerned about the chemical weapons attacks in Syria, but they want us to learn the lessons of Iraq,\" he said. \"They don't want a rush to war. They want things done in the right way, working with the international community.\" He said Britain \"doesn't need reckless and impulsive leadership, it needs calm and measured leadership\". Mr Miliband said Britain's relationship with the US \"remains strong\" despite the vote. He said there is a lesson that Britain must do what is in its national interest, even if that means doing something different to America. He also said that Mr Cameron must \"find other ways\" to put pressure on Mr Assad. The result of the vote was condemned by former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown, who tweeted that in \"50 years trying to serve my country I have never felt so depressed [or] ashamed\". He later told the BBC that by doing nothing President Assad will use chemical weapons more \"those weapons will become more commonplace in the Middle East battlefield\" and \"we will feel the effects of that as well\". Thirty Conservative and nine Liberal Democrat MPs voted against the government's motion. The defeat comes as a potential blow to the authority of Mr Cameron, who had already watered down a government motion proposing military action, in response to Labour's demands for more evidence of President Assad's guilt. The BBC's political editor Nick Robinson said the prime minister had now lost control of his own foreign and defence policy, and as a result he will cut a diminished figure on the international stage. He added that some strong advocates of the transatlantic relationship were worried that America may now question the value and reliability of Britain as an ally. During the debate, Labour had seen its own amendment - calling for \"compelling\" evidence that the regime was responsible for chemical attacks - rejected by MPs by 114 votes. But, unexpectedly, MPs also rejected the government's motion. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said the government defeat was down to the \"fatally flawed\" case put to MPs by Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, claiming the pair's credibility was now diminished. Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said so many of Mr Cameron's own MPs had voted with Labour because they were now \"unwilling to take him at his word\". Conservative rebel Crispin Blunt said he hoped the vote would \"relieve ourselves of some of this imperial pretension that a country of our size can seek to be involved in every conceivable conflict that's going on around the world\". In other developments: In a statement, the White House said President Obama believed \"that there are core interests at stake for the United States and that countries who violate international norms regarding chemical weapons need to be held accountable\". Obama administration officials on Thursday told a group of US lawmakers in a conference call that it was \"beyond a doubt that chemical weapons were used, and used intentionally by the Assad regime,\" said Eliot Engel, the senior Democratic member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the US would \"continue to work with Britain and consult with Britain as we are with all our allies\". On Friday French President Francois Hollande told the newspaper Le Monde that he would still be willing to take action without Britain's involvement. He said he supported taking \"firm\" punitive action over an attack he said had caused \"irreparable\" harm to the Syrian people. Germany, however, has ruled out taking part. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told the Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper that \"such participation has not been sought nor is it being considered by us\". Meanwhile, Mr Assad told a group of Yemeni MPs on Thursday that Syria would defend itself against any aggression, according to Syria's Sana news agency. \"Syria, with its steadfast people and brave army, will continue eliminating terrorism, which is utilised by Israel and Western countries to serve their interests in fragmenting the region,\" he said.", "question": "MPs have rejected possible UK military action against Syrian President Bashar al - Assad 's government to @placeholder the use of chemical weapons .", "option_0": "resolve", "option_1": "deter", "option_2": "improve", "option_3": "ban", "option_4": "investigate"}

{"id": 621, "article": "HM Inspectorate of Probation found delays in getting offenders to start their work, and said too many were let off if they did not attend. In one case, an offender had completed just 16 hours in the 17 months since he had been sentenced. The Ministry of Justice said it was acting on the report's recommendations. Anything from 40 to 300 hours of unpaid work - or \"community payback\" - may be given for offences like shoplifting, theft, drug offences, or criminal damage. Some 70,000 offenders were ordered to do unpaid work such as garden maintenance, decorating or litter-picking in 2014. Inspectors looked at 100 cases and interviewed 86 offenders from different probation divisions for their report. The report outlined 15 recommendations for improvement. Some of the problems identified were: Seven years ago the government, then led by Gordon Brown, placed an order for 10,000 orange bibs. They were to be worn by offenders doing unpaid work under a re-branded scheme known as \"community payback\". It was intended to give the public confidence that community sentences, involving clearing communal paths and gardens, picking up litter and painting over graffiti, were a \"tough\" alternative to imprisonment. When the coalition came to power in 2010 it promised to make unpaid work more physical and intense, with unemployed offenders required to complete their sentences more quickly. The difficulty has always been organisation. Getting people who lead chaotic lives - many of them with drink or drug problems - to work on time is a task in itself. If sanctions are applied, they will end up in prison; if not, the sentence cannot be enforced. As the inspection report reveals, it is a problem the authorities still have not solved. Inspectors did praise instances of high-quality work, and cases where offenders believed they had gained skills from using good tools and equipment. They also highlighted that many offenders viewed their sentence positively and \"were determined to... desist from future offending\". Among its recommendations were that community rehabilitation companies should reduce how often offenders are turned away from work when they have reported on time, and to try to create objectives for unpaid work that \"match the circumstances of the offender\". The chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, said it appeared in most cases that unpaid work was viewed simply as a punishment, which was a \"wasted opportunity\". \"Although we found some high-quality management and delivery, much of it was simply not good enough, lacking in focus on the basic requirement to deliver and enforce the sentence of the court.\" He called for \"urgent remedial action\". A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said it wanted \"much more effective rehabilitation\" - which had to start with making sure offenders turned up on time and faced consequences if they did not. \"It's totally unacceptable for offenders to skip work enforced by the courts. \"We accept all the recommendations for the Ministry of Justice in this report and are already taking action to implement them.\"", "question": "The way that offenders sentenced to unpaid community work in England and Wales are @placeholder and supervised has been criticised by inspectors .", "option_0": "punished", "option_1": "managed", "option_2": "free", "option_3": "housed", "option_4": "treated"}
{"id": 622, "article": "But, battling waves as big as houses, the crews of the Holyhead and Moelfre lifeboats made it to the stricken ship. Now, 50 years on the RNLI marked one of the most remarkable rescues in its 192-year history. Crew members reunited at an event on Friday to remember the rescue. Graham Drinkwater, Eric Jones, Jackie Hughes, Will Jones and Brian Stewart - five of the Anglesey crew who braved the conditions back on 2 December, 1966 - were guests of honour at the event in Holyhead. In a video message played to them, one of the rescued Greek sailors gave thanks to the rescuers for saving his life. The Nafsiporos' Second Officer Anestis Rokopoulos, now 73, said: \"My only message is 'thank you'. I am alive only because of these people. I make a family and I make grandchildren only because of these people.\" \"We had no control and no steering. The rocks looked like knives. Then from the depths of the sea came these boats and we said, 'They have come for us',\" he said. All 17 crew on board the Holyhead and Moelfre lifeboats were awarded rare medals for gallantry, in an operation that involved three lifeboats over 24 hours. First to the rescue was the Douglas RNLI lifeboat, under Coxswain Robert Lee, which launched at 08:30 GMT to chase the Nafsiporos as the storm drove her across the sea. Although a Shackleton aircraft circling above the ship was able to give its position, volunteers on the Douglas boat never saw the vessel, as the bad weather reduced visibility to less than 460m (1,500ft). Meanwhile, Lt Comm Harold Harvey, RNLI North West's lifeboats inspector, volunteered his services and the Holyhead lifeboat St Cybi was launched at 10:30. After three hours of searching, the Holyhead crew reached the stricken freighter, which was just eight miles (13km) from the Anglesey coast. The waves were 10m (35ft) high and the Nafsiporos was rolling and being lifted high in the sea, its huge propellers churning in the air above the heads of the lifeboat crew. Holyhead crewman Graham Drinkwater was just 19 at the time. \"I always remember the first moment we launched because that was my first time down the slipway,\" he said. \"Then the actual trip out from the lifeboat station to the area of the casualty was fantastic. Talk about a rollercoaster. I mean, you haven't seen anything 'til you've been out on that.\" Mr Drinkwater, who went on to become lifeboat operations manager at Holyhead, added: \"I remember the first moment I saw the ship. It was so massive compared to our boat. I got a bit apprehensive at that moment. \"We missed the first time, went round again, had a massive collision with the side of the Nafsiporos and then we were alongside.\" It was now gone 16:00 and the sun had set. One of the freighter's lifeboats had come loose and was swinging, making it difficult for her rescuers to get anywhere near her. The Greek crewmen on board had to climb down a ladder on the side of the ship, dodging the swinging pendulum of their own lifeboat, and then leap to the RNLI boat, which was also being lifted and dropped by the sea. Holyhead Second Coxswain William Jones said: \"The rise and fall between the ship and lifeboat was enormous. One moment we were looking up at her and the next we were in line with her deck, a matter of around 20 feet or more.\" Five crewmen made it to safety, but then the Nafsiporos' lifeboat fell crashing on to the Holyhead boat, damaging it and forcing the crew to withdraw. The Moelfre lifeboat had already been out since 07:00, assisting two other vessels struggling in the storm. The crew had barely got back to the station when they were asked to launch again to go to the aid of the Nafisiporos. Coxswain Dic Evans, who died in 2001, managed to manoeuvre his lifeboat alongside the Nafsiporos. He pulled another 10 of the Nafsiporos' crew on to the lifeboat's deck, while four refused to abandon ship. Survivor John Patsoulas later remembered the Moelfre lifeboat crew standing in formation on the lifeboat's decks, linking their arms shoulder to shoulder, waiting to receive the sailors. He and the other men rescued recalled lifeboatman David Evans, Coxswain Evans' son, as a \"bear of a mana€| big, strong and powerful\", who grabbed the sailors and tossed them into the lifeboat \"like sacks of corn\". The Moelfre boat was badly damaged and without electrics and lighting, but set course for Holyhead to bring the 10 survivors to shore. By the time they arrived on land, Coxswain Evans, then aged 61, had been at an open wheel exposed to the hurricane conditions for nearly 13 hours without a break. The Holyhead crew paused only to have a cup of tea, then launched again to stand by the Nafsiporos through the night until a Dutch tug towed it, and its remaining crew, back to Liverpool the following morning. Despite the dangerous conditions and near-misses, there were no fatalities or casualties. Mr Harvey said: \"We were all exhausted after 22 hours at sea, and during the night following the rescue many thoughts and silent prayers occupied our minds. \"Once ashore, the rum came out. We were all proud and grateful men, speaking little and bound by the experience of such extreme lifeboat drama and action.\"", "question": "As a storm raged , their engine failed , and they drifted dangerously towards the rocks of north Anglesey , the crew of the Nafsiporos Greek cargo ship were @placeholder hope of ever surviving .", "option_0": "denied", "option_1": "declared", "option_2": "losing", "option_3": "rendered", "option_4": "unleashed"}

They said it could exert a pressure up to 11.5 tonnes. That is 20 times the strength of a white shark's bite. Tito Aureliano, one of the co-authors of the study, said the animal's head was better structured for biting than that of the T-Rex. The Purussaurus's stout and robust skull with conical teeth were made for gripping large prey. The findings by the team drawn from a number of research and academic institutions were published in the online Plos One journal. Purussaurus brasiliensis could reach a length of more than 12.5m (41ft), longer than a London bus, and was an unrivalled predator in its wetland habitat, the researchers said. \"The Purussaurus and the Tyrannosaurus lived in different ages but there is no doubt that the Purussaurus would have won a fight between the two of them,\" Aline Ghilardi, one of the co-authors of the study, told BBC Brasil. The paleontologist from Rio de Janeiro's Federal University said that while the Purussaurus was discovered in the 19th Century, it had been not been the focus of much scientific study despite its dominance in the Amazon region during its heyday. Ms Ghilardi said that while it may have had no natural predators, the Purussaurus fell victim to the geological movements that led to the rise of the Andes mountain range. \"The rise of the Andes changed everything for the Purossaurus, which previously thrived on the presence of huge mammals in the regions,\" she said.

As he was taken from the court, the defendant turned to the Magee family and said: \"I am sorry for your loss\". Mr Magee was found stabbed to death just outside the home of his girlfriend, Courtney Ward, in the Summerhill Park area of Twinbrook in May 2015. Ms Ward had been married to Koca, and they had three children together. A prosecution barrister said that Koca had recently separated from Ms Ward and had searched social media for evidence that she was seeing other men, confronting her on occasions. The barrister said Koca was \"an aggressive man in that context\". An examination of Koca's phone had shown that he had saved copies of Facebook photographs of Ms Ward with her boss at work, and also with Mr Magee, with whom she had formed a new relationship after they met at a local gym. Mr Magee went outside Ms Ward's home early on  30 May 2015 to look for a delayed pizza delivery man when he was attacked and murdered by Koca. The court heard that Mr Magee died as a result of six stab wounds to his chest, abdomen and thighs, described as \"multiple and significant injuries\". A defence barrister told the court that Koca's eventual guilty plea was motivated by the recognition of the \"undoubted and overwhelming tragedy he has visited on the family of Mr Magee\".

Nuclear inspectors will want to verify Iran's compliance with the terms of the deal before lifting sanctions, but the country's Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh is confident the country can reach full capacity quickly. Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer specialising in sanctions, said there was huge excitement, despite the potential problems ahead. \"Sanctions have crippled Iran's oil production, halving oil exports and severely limiting new development projects. \"Foreign trade and investment will allow Iran to make huge efficiencies and drive down the cost of production.\" Edward Morse, global head of commodities research at Citi in New York, said that after years of underinvestment there would be a long delay before exports reached their full potential. \"Sanctions have clearly impaired Iran's ability to maintain its mostly mature oilfields, let alone develop new projects,\" he said.

Now, after Hull claimed the process was flawed, an independent panel has ruled the decision \"cannot stand\" and told the club they can try again. In its judgment, the panel found that the original ruling had placed too much weight on objections from supporters. Hull owner Assem Allam had said he would not continue to invest in the Premier League club if the change was rejected. The 75-year-old businessman, who took over City in 2010, believes switching to Hull Tigers will help the club's \"global\" appeal. Following the panel's ruling, Hull, who are 15th in the table, issued a statement, claiming victory after proving that \"the process adopted by the FA was unfair and biased\". It added: \"The ball is now in the FA's possession, with the club seeking clarification on how the FA will proceed in a fair and unbiased manner.\" The tribunal was especially critical of Football Supporters' Federation chairman Malcolm Clarke, a member of the FA Council. It accused Clarke of \"bias\" and using his influence to effectively - and wrongly - delegate the council's decision to fans. \"Rather than take account of all the matters that were relevant to the decision, he decided in advance to base his decision on one, namely the support of the club's supporters,\" read a statement.

There is no way that I won't be.\" Mr Sanders has come under pressure to bow out since Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee. But the Vermont Senator has vowed to fight until the party convention. Mrs Clinton holds a commanding lead in the delegate count. Democratic leaders are concerned about party unity after a clash between officials and Sanders supporters at a party convention in Nevada over the weekend. Sanders supporters yelled at party officials and picked up chairs. The state's party chairwoman later received death threats. Hillary Clinton's insistence that the race for the Democratic nomination is effectively over is supported by delegate maths, but it will do little to quell the growing acrimony between her supporters and those of Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator continues to insist that he has a narrow path to the nomination and will fight for every last delegate. Mrs Clinton has tried ignoring these claims. Now she's addressing them head-on, perhaps hoping it will allow her to shift focus onto Donald Trump. Over the coming weeks she will likely test out a variety of possible lines of attack against the Republican, including the charge that he is too risky to put in the Oval Office. This critique echoes concerns I encountered numerous time on the campaign trail among those who supported Mr Trump's Republican opponents. Mrs Clinton may be hoping that a campaign crafted around national security could win over independents and moderate Republicans who are uneasy with Mr Trump's brash style and foreign policy inexperience. It may be an effective strategy - but it's one made more difficult as long as Mr Sanders continues to act as a thorn in Mrs Clinton's left flank. Senator Minority Leader Harry Reid said Mr Sanders had not done enough to rein in his supporters. The Sanders campaign has sought to downplay the Nevada incident. Also in the interview, Mrs Clinton said Mr Trump, her likely general election opponent, is not qualified to be president. Her reasons included Mr Trump's plan to bar Muslims from travelling to the US, his call to step back from Nato and his negative comments about the UK government, which she called America's \"closest ally\".

Microsoft said the vulnerability in its code allowed attackers to \"install programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights\". \"This vulnerability is related to the Duqu malware,\" it said. Microsoft said the full update would not be ready this month, and did not provide a target release date. In the meantime it said that the workaround will cause some documents to \"fail to display properly\". The firm's security warning follows an investigation by the Laboratory of Cryptography and Systems Security (Crysys) at Budapest University. Earlier this week it revealed that the malware had been spread using a previously unknown vulnerability embedded in a Microsoft Word document. Internet security firm, Symantec, confirmed that Microsoft had identified the same bit of code. \"It is a link point between Microsoft Word and the system software,\" said Greg Day, Symantec's director of security strategy. \"This takes what you type in and turns it into what comes up on the screen.\" The security firm has confirmed Duqu infections at six different computer networks belonging to unidentified organisations across a total of eight countries. Microsoft's security report noted that the success of the attacks depended on users opening email attachments. \"We have taught people for years that clicking on executable files from unknown sources is not sensible, but clicking on a Word document is a normal business practice,\" Mr Day told the BBC. \"Since we think the Duqu attackers do reconnaissance beforehand they might have been able to exploit this to make people more likely to have opened the documents, either by having built up a relationship with them or having used an existing one to gain trust.\" Mr Day said the lessons for business were to ensure that their security software is up to date and that they have educated their employees to question whether an attachment comes from a trustworthy source.", "question": "Microsoft has released a @placeholder \" fix \" for a software vulnerability that left computer systems exposed to the Duqu infection .", "option_0": "smart", "option_1": "comprehensive", "option_2": "fresh", "option_3": "temporary", "option_4": "revised"}

A transaction tax could raise ?¡ê20bn a year for the Exchequer and help stabilise markets, the Green Party said. The idea of taxing financial transactions is not new. Sweden introduced a similar tax in the mid-1980s but subsequently abandoned the measure after many trading companies left the country. The European Commission tried to introduce a transaction tax in 2011 but failed in the face of opposition from several EU countries, including the UK. A smaller group of member states - including Germany, France, Spain and Italy - is trying to take the project forward among themselves but have not yet reached an agreement. A transaction tax could raise considerable amounts of money and some say it has the potential to make financial markets less volatile because, for example, it might deter high-volume, short-term, speculative trading. It's also been argued the City should pay more following its role in the financial crisis. Opponents say that the tax could threaten London's success as a financial hub, as companies would relocate elsewhere to avoid higher charges. And there are fears that any additional costs to financial companies would be passed onto consumers. There is also a view that any financial benefits would be dwarfed by the costs of a weaker economy that could result. When the measure was put forward at an EU level, the UK was part of a vanguard of countries to defeat the motion. Britain even took the European Commission to court to challenge the legality of such a tax, although it was unsuccessful. We have yet to see any detail about the Greens' proposed measure. While there are precedents that could help policymakers looking to develop a transaction tax, a UK government seeking to do so would face strong resistance.

{"id": 678, "article": "Sales growth in their home market slowed to a virtual trickle last year, at least when compared with the ballooning market a couple of years back, and it is set to remain relatively weak throughout 2012. So Chinese carmakers, which have long fought tough rivals from well-established non-Chinese manufacturers, are looking to diversify abroad. Many of the new Chinese cars displayed at Auto China 2012 are expected to be exported to Europe. Some Chinese carmakers have entered Europe, already, of course, mainly through acquisitions. Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) owns MG in the UK. Geely owns Volvo and has a stake in Manganese Bronze, the maker of London's black cabs. Others are even gearing up for direct investments in the mass-production of their own marques within the European Union. Great Wall Motors was the first to arrive with The Steed, a small pickup truck that will be produced in its recently opened factory in Bulgaria. Others are sure to follow as cash-rich Chinese companies target parts of the world where local investment has dried up because of the financial crisis. \"Just as the Japanese and Koreans did decades ago, Chinese carmakers are hoping to gain strong positions in the longer term in the Western European and US markets,\" observes the German magazine Der Spiegel. Great Wall's Bulgarian factory, in the village of Bahovitsa, near the town of Lovech, is not the first car plant in the area. Bulgarians used to assemble the infamous Soviet Moskvich here during communist times, and this was where Rover's plans to produce its old Maestro model flopped some 17 years ago. Great Wall's joint venture with Bulgaria's Litex Motors comes across as much more ambitious than either of those, however. Though initially no more than 120 people will work here, European Whole Vehicle Type Approval has already been granted for several models, and the plan is to expand the workforce to 2,000 people and produce 50,000 cars a year for the European market. \"Bulgaria is an excellent starting point for our entry into the European markets,\" Great Wall's president Wang Fengying said after opening the plant in February. \"In the next three to five years, we will have a great variety of car brands, which will be sold in all European countries,\" she said, according to an exuberant Bulgarian media. \"Bulgaria will flood the rest of Europe with cars made in Lovech,\" exclaimed the daily newspaper Standart, \"just as the Japanese and Koreans.\" Others were more guarded, pointing out that Chinese cars have yet to establish a reputation of quality and reliability in Europe. Bulgaria might one day be remembered as \"the place where the Chinese car expansion into Europe started\", observed weekly magazine Kapital. \"The only question is, what cars will the plant produce, and who is going to buy them?\" Bulgarian-produced Chinese cars will go head-to-head with the Dacia brand, which is built at Pitesti in neighbouring Romania. The Pitesti plant, owned by the French carmaker Renault, produces affordable cars that also rely on an \"inexpensive but reliable\" marketing strategy. But Dacia and Renault are far from worried. According to the Romanian website Ziare, Great Wall's cars will be more expensive than Dacia's, as well as inferior because of the company's lack of experience. Great Wall's president acknowledges that the carmaker has much to learn. \"We realise that we have a long way to go to achieve some of the standards that German cars have,\" she told Bulgarian daily Dnevnik. \"But from a market point of view, we know that there are also people in Germany who would like to buy a quality car at a reasonable price. \"This is our chance to establish a presence in Germany.\" Henry Li, general manager of BYD Auto's export division, agrees. \"In the short term, competition will be more fierce, especially when international brands are launching low-cost vehicles,\" he says. \"We try to create our own competitive edge. We are not only staying in a low segment, but are creating new technologies and improving quality.\" Chinese ambitions in Europe are not limited to the motor industry, however. \"China is buying up Europe,\" the European Council on Foreign Relations notes in a current policy brief. \"Its automobile manufacturers have bought MG and Volvo. Its transportation firms are acquiring, leasing or managing harbours, airports, and logistical and assembly bases across the continent. Its development bank is financing projects in Europe's periphery, much like it does in Africa.\" China has been actively seeking business opportunities in the Balkan region, \"especially in Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria\", according to Prague-based website Transitions Online. In October last year, for instance, Guangdong Nuclear Power Group said it might take part in efforts to build two new reactors at the Cernavoda nuclear power plant in Romania. In Serbia, a consortium of Chinese companies is investing some 2bn euros in the country's EPS power utility. Another Chinese company is building a 1,500m bridge over the Danube near Belgrade. Similar stories are emerging across Europe, which last year attracted more investment from China than the rest of Asia or North America did. \"In 2011, for the first time since Chinese companies started heading abroad, Europe became their favoured destination,\" according to the French newspaper Les Echos. As yet, China's non-financial investment in the 27 European Union member states totals just $15bn, or less than 0.2% of all foreign investment in Europe, according to the consultancy Rhodium Group.

They were made while Freud was living in Germany, before his family fled to England in 1933 as Hitler came to power, and saved and dated by his mother. The National Portrait Gallery said the archive would \"give added context\" to the two works housed in the gallery's collection - a self-portrait in oils and a charcoal drawing of Lord Goodman from 1985. Several drawings in the sketchbooks show the beginnings of portraits, including Lord Goodman's, starting with the nose and eyes and developing outwards.

Most medicines for moderate to severe pain, called opioids, work by reducing the perception of pain. They do this by attaching to specific proteins in the brain and organs of the body, called opioid receptors.

And earlier work by the same team, published in PLoS ONE, identified the toxin-producing strain of C. perfringens in a young woman with MS. But experts urge caution, saying more work is needed to explore the link. No-one knows the exact cause of Multiple sclerosis (MS), but it is likely that a mixture of genetic and environmental factors play a role. It's a neurological condition which affects around 100,000 people in the UK. C. perfringens, found in soil and contaminated undercooked meat, comes in different strains. Most cases of human infection occur as food poisoning - diarrhoea and stomach cramps that usually resolve within a day or so. More rarely, the bacterium can cause gas gangrene. And a particular strain of C. perfringens, Type B, which the Weill team says it identified in a human for the first time, makes a toxin that can travel through blood to the brain. In their lab studies on rodents the researchers found that the toxin, called epsilon, crossed the blood-brain barrier and killed myelin-producing cells - the typical damage seen in MS. Lead investigator Jennifer Linden said the findings are important because if it can be confirmed that epsilon toxin is a trigger of MS, a vaccine or antibody against the toxin might be able to halt or prevent this debilitating disease. She presented the group's latest findings at a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. Dr Susan Kohlhaas, Head of Biomedical Research at the MS Society, said: \"Discovering potential causes or triggers for MS could enable us to develop better treatments or even, one day, prevent the condition.

{"id": 700, "article": "A federal judge certified the legal proceedings, Reuters reports, saying investors who claim they lost money could pursue their claims as groups. Facebook told the BBC that it was disappointed with the decision and it has launched an appeal against it. The firm's initial public offering (IPO) in May 2012 raised $16bn (?¡ê10bn). The investors say that by purchasing the firm's shares at inflated prices they lost money. That year, its shares began trading on 18 May in New York at $38 per share, but the price fell to almost half the amount of $17.55 on 4 September. The price stayed below the IPO price for more than a year, but shares ultimately rebounded and closed up at $107.26 on the Nasdaq index on Tuesday. District judge Robert Sweet gave the lawsuits class action certification on 11 December, but the order was made public on Tuesday, Reuters reports. Investors claim that Facebook omitted information about revised revenue projections and the impact that increased mobile usage, at a time when there was little advertising on mobile devices, would have on its revenues. But Mr Sweet said Facebook provided \"an impressive amount of evidence\" to indicate that shareholders knew how mobile usage would affect the firm's revenue. However, he rejected the tech giant's argument that shareholders should pursue their claims individually. In a 55-page decision, Mr. Sweet said that given the extraordinary size of the case, allowing two subclasses \"in fact adds more weight to the predominance of common questions and answers, practically negating the individualized questions raised\". Facebook told the BBC that it believes the class certification is \"without merit\".

Ball two also went for six, effectively giving Dorchester 13 runs from one legitimate delivery. Cucos responded with a yorker, from which McComb was unable to score. Ball four (the third legitimate delivery) went for four and was then followed by another no-ball which also flew to the boundary for four. The next two balls were flayed for six, leaving the scores level with one delivery to come. Swinbrook brought the field in, but McComb advanced down the pitch to hit his fifth six of the over, winning the game and bringing up his own century. \"It was an amazing end to the game,\" said McComb, who has played for Dorchester for 20 years. \"240 is a tough target to chase in our league and we never looked ahead of the rate. \"I had nothing to lose in the final over and the boundaries weren't huge, so I knew there was a slim chance. \"I've had an arthritic ankle for many years and I can't run very well between the wickets, as the lads constantly remind me, so I either try to score a boundary or hop for a single! \"When they brought the field in for the final ball I knew if I got bat on ball we'd be OK.\" Fellow Dorchester batsman Richard Sharman, who was scoring at the time, added: \"I got so excited the scorebook's a bit of a mess, but it was a pleasure to watch.\"", "question": "A village cricket side scored 40 runs from the final over of a league match to secure the most @placeholder of victories .", "option_0": "successful", "option_1": "unlikely", "option_2": "dramatic", "option_3": "level", "option_4": "proud"}

He will continue the tradition of presenting the US president with a shamrock. There had been speculation he would face a motion of no confidence at the meeting but that did not happen. The speculation was that a no confidence vote would result from his handling of a police whistleblower controversy. The controversy began more than three years ago when two whistleblowers - Sgt Maurice McCabe and the now retired John Wilson - alleged there was widespread corruption with the Republic of Ireland's driving licence penalty points system. A public inquiry is to be held into whether Sgt McCabe was falsely smeared by senior officers in the An Garda S¨ªoch¨¢na (police). There will also be an independent review of police operations. Questions had been raised about Mr Kenny's future arising from his government's handling of the Gardai whistleblower affair last week. The Taoiseach had indicated that he would stand down as Fine Gael leader before the next general election but many in his party, were fearful last week that the country could face a general election because of the whistleblower affair with him still leader. Mr Kenny received a standing ovation at tonight's short meeting, and faced no questions from his TDs, Senators and MEPs after he outlined his decision. Last week, the Irish coalition government - which is made up of Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance - survived a vote of no confidence in the Irish parliament (D¨¢il).

{"id": 718, "article": "In a city with mainly unpainted brick houses, many of them unfinished, architect Freddy Mamani's brightly coloured ostentatious mansions are leaving a very colourful mark in the otherwise dull cityscape. They are dubbed cholets, a mixture of the word chalet (large house) and chola (indigenous woman). \"El Alto is characterised by its cold climate for its topography with mountains, it's dry. With the colour we add more life to the streets of El Alto,\" says Mr Mamani, a local architect whose creations can now be seen not only in El Alto but across Bolivia and other South American countries like Peru and Brazil. He has constructed 70 of these mansions in El Alto alone and continues to get more orders every day. Mr Mamani is inspired by indigenous Andean iconography. Not far away from El Alto, on the shores of the Lake Titicaca, lie the ruins of Tiwanaku, the capital of a pre-Incan civilisation. The geometric patterns he incorporates into his buildings resemble those found in Tiwanaku's structures, he says. It is a celebration of the traditional culture of the indigenous people of Bolivia. For a new class of rich Aymara indigenous people in El Alto, these mansions have become quite the status symbol. And they are willing to fork out anywhere between $150,000 (?¡ê100,000) to $300,000 for one of these glitzy buildings. There are penthouses on the upper floors and space for shops on the ground floor. And if you want to throw a party, there is a party hall in between, sometimes even two. And the owners of these colourful mansions can rake in a tidy sum by renting out these spaces. It is in the party room where many from the Aymara community celebrate weddings. Inside, the colours are just as intense as outside and the chandeliers dazzle. Mr Mamani's work has inspired many copycats. On a drive with him around El Alto, he pointed some of these copies out to me. Some of these other architects and builders used to work for him, says Mamani. What separates his work from theirs? According to Mr Mamani, a lot of works are similar but \"they don't have a language, you could say\". \"Mine for example, they have an essence that can be described, it has its own language, its own identity.\"", "question": "High on the Bolivian plateau in the city of El Alto , a new architectural @placeholder is becoming quite the rage .", "option_0": "health", "option_1": "development", "option_2": "phenomenon", "option_3": "masterpiece", "option_4": "general"}

A US team led by Dr Mary Cushman, of the University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, analysed data from about 30,000 US citizens aged 45 and above. It identified 495 participants who had developed thinking and memory problems, or cognitive impairment, during the three-year study. They were compared to 587 people with no cognitive problems. People with AB blood type made up 6% of the group who developed cognitive impairment, which is higher than the 4% found in the general population. They were 82% more likely to have difficulties with day-to-day memory, language and attention, which can signal the onset of dementia. However, the study did not look at the risk of dementia. The study supported the idea that having a certain blood group, such as O, may give a lower risk for cardiovascular disease, which in turn protected the brain, the researchers said. \"Our study looks at blood type and risk of cognitive impairment, but several studies have shown that factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia,\" said Dr Cushman. \"Blood type is also related to other vascular conditions like stroke, so the findings highlight the connections between vascular issues and brain health. More research is needed to confirm these results.\" Commenting on the study, Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the research did not look at risk of dementia, and it was too early to say whether AB blood group might be linked to a higher risk of the condition. \"Current evidence suggests the best ways to keep the brain healthy are a balanced diet, not smoking and regular exercise,\" he said.", "question": "There may be a link between a @placeholder blood type and memory loss in later life , American research suggests .", "option_0": "decreased", "option_1": "rare", "option_2": "prominent", "option_3": "popular", "option_4": "certain"}

He took them home to examine than and found the bag also contained the component parts for a sawn-off shotgun. Mr Crowe said Watt returned them to the colleague and said he did not want them - but the colleague also did not want them.

The Tuaregs of northern Mali, who are mostly light-skinned, have a long history of seeking autonomy from the rest of the country, saying they have been discriminated against by the government in Bamako. BBC International Development Correspondent Mark Doyle says the struggle, by the mainly black-African army to re-take Kidal, held by the Tuaregs in the far north, has been key in reigniting racial tensions, along with plans to hold elections next month. The Human Rights Watch report said the Malian army seriously abused a number of ethnic Tuareg villagers, threatening to kill them, beating them and using racial slurs. It also said about 100 black Africans were arrested in Kidal, with many being robbed, beaten or expelled towards the south. Mali's Foreign Minister Tieman Coulibaly has condemned the Tuareg action. \"In Kidal, black people are openly attacked,\" he told The Associated Press. \"That is new.  Before, racism was latent, a bit creeping, but now it is unashamed.\" The MNLA rebels have denied the charges. \"Civilians across the ethnic divide have already suffered enough,\" said Corinne Dufka from Human Rights Watch. \"The recent abuses by both sides and renewed fighting around Kidal underscores the urgent need for Malian soldiers and rebel combatants to respect the laws of war, minimise civilian harm and ensure the humane treatment of detainees,\" she said. The Islamist groups abandoned the towns they controlled ahead of the French-led advance, which began in January. But the MNLA, which is fighting for autonomy for northern Mali, has refused to leave Kidal, while the army has been reluctant to attack the town in the Sahara desert.

Sergei Lavrov also announced that heavy military hardware would be withdrawn from the region, and said a ceasefire would come into force on Monday. He is currently in Munich for a Nato conference. US Vice-President Mike Pence, also in Munich, said the US would \"continue to hold Russia accountable\" and would demand that Russia honour the 2015 ceasefire deal signed in Minsk, one of the provisions of which is the removal of heavy weapons.

{"id": 747, "article": "But depending on the outcome of the vote on 8 November, one of the two can expect to be thrust into a major financial role. Donald Trump has said that if he becomes president, he will hand control of his business empire to Ivanka and her brothers, Don and Eric. If Hillary Clinton wins the race for the White House, the intention is for her and husband Bill to step down from the board of the Clinton Foundation and for Chelsea, currently its vice-chair, to take over its day-to-day operations. Both candidates' plans have come under fierce scrutiny from critics, who say they involve big conflicts of interest. So what are the risks and why should they be allowed to get away with such arrangements? Well, first of all, there is absolutely no law that prevents them. Previous presidents, from Lyndon B Johnson on, have avoided any hint of impropriety by placing their business interests into what is known as a blind trust. This means that the president gives up the right to manage his (or her) money personally, handing the task over to independent trustees. In LBJ's case, he set one up in 1963, after assuming the presidency in the wake of John F Kennedy's assassination. He and his wife, Lady Bird, owned a TV station, KTBC, in Austin, Texas, and wanted to avoid regulatory problems without having to sell it. In 1978, the Ethics in Government Act formalised the rules on blind trusts, but left them entirely voluntary as far as presidents are concerned. Mr Trump has spoken about putting his holdings into a blind trust, but then said that his three oldest children would be in charge of the company, which would not pass the independence test. \"I don't know if it's a blind trust if Ivanka, Don and Eric run it,\" he said earlier this year. \"If that's a blind trust, I don't know. \"But I would probably have my children run it with my executives and I wouldn't ever be involved.\" In any case, even if Mr Trump no longer controls those assets directly, he could hardly be expected to forget what they were, so he would remain vulnerable to allegations that his political decisions were designed to favour his business interests. The Clinton Foundation, which came into being in 2001, poses a different set of problems. Former US presidents tend to set up some kind of charitable centre on leaving office, usually with a presidential library attached, and Hillary's husband Bill was no exception. But, of course, there has never before been a presidential candidate married to an ex-president, so the foundation has turned into a headache for Hillary. Donors to the foundation have included a number of foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Algeria and Qatar, as well as various rich individuals and companies. Critics of the Clintons say these donations, many of them made while Hillary was Secretary of State, represent attempts to influence US policy. And for those opponents, if Hillary wins, putting Chelsea in charge would not be an acceptable solution, even though the foundation's president, Donna Shalala, has pledged that many of its programmes will be spun off as separate non-governmental organisations and foreign donations will no longer be accepted. And there is another big spanner in the works for both presidential candidates: the US constitution has a provision that could make life very difficult for either of them. The constitution's Emoluments Clause states: \"No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States: and no person holding any office of profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.\" It's easy to see what the point of that was. Having created a republic and enshrined the ideal of equality, the Founding Fathers wanted to prevent the US acquiring an aristocracy or being beholden to foreign powers that might undermine those ideals. But it also seems to say that no-one in senior public office should have any foreign income. Does that apply to the Clinton Foundation, with its record of foreign donors? And more directly, does that also apply to the Trump Organization, which has joint property ventures and licensing deals stretching from Panama City to Istanbul? In theory, yes. In practice, it probably depends on that little phrase, \"the consent of the Congress\". Any foreign deal or donation involving either of those bodies could easily spawn a Congressional investigation into a possible breach of the constitution. And once the juggernaut started to roll, it could lead all the way to impeachment. For either Chelsea or Ivanka, life is set to get a whole lot busier after 8 November.

All this comes with the backdrop of a record low Bank rate. One debt group - the Money Charity - said it feared the low-interest rate environment meant that people were becoming unaccustomed to saving and vulnerable to financial shocks as they had no savings buffer.

{"id": 751, "article": "She was told by the captain of the Hanjin Geneva that its South Korean owners had gone bankrupt, so the ship was barred from international ports. The 25-year-old is taking part in an artist in residency programme, which was meant to be \"23 Days at Sea\". She and the 25 sailors on board were due to return to dock on 15 September, but for now there's no word on when they will get to go home. The Geneva is one of dozens of Hanjin vessels stranded around the world since the firm, South Korea's largest shipping company, filed for bankruptcy protection. Ports, fearing they will not get paid, are refusing to let Hanjin boats dock or unload. So far, Hanjin ships in the US have been granted protection, which will allow American-bound vessels to unload their cargo. But for the Geneva, it might be days or weeks of floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, near the coast of Japan, as it waits for a solution. Rebecca figured it would just be a hiccup when she first heard the news. She thought their ship would be redirected to a different port, or that a boat would be sent to fetch the passengers. That was 13 days ago. \"I have found the indefinite duration the most difficult aspect to deal with as an artist,\" she said. \"Formulating a strategy to make work becomes impossible when things could change at any minute\". Her daily life on board she says, is structured around meals. There is enough food and drink on board to last them a few weeks. The 23 days she was meant to spend at sea as part of the residency programme, run by Access Gallery in Vancouver, are now up. The programme, which started last year, sends artists across the Pacific Ocean each year between Vancouver and Shanghai and is meant to spark their creativity. Its inaugural trip saw more than 800 responses for four vacancies. Rebecca was one of four artists selected this year. \"I was, and am, excited about the trip as it chimed with a lot of my interests as an artist,\" she said. She is currently an MA student at the Royal College of Art in London, specialising in absurdist film-making. Her proposal for the trip was to explore how comedy arises in the tension between a mechanical system imposed into nature. \"The situation is completely ironic,\" she said. \"It is bizarre how much it suits my interests.\" The chairman of Hanjin Group has given a 40bn won ($36m; ?¡ê27m) bailout to Hanjin Shipping, but regulators warned that securing funds could still take \"considerable time\". Yet how much time exactly remains unknown. \"I want to be informed of a definite plan for how the passengers are going to be able to disembark. I can work with a plan,\" Rebecca said. The first thing she wants to do when she gets on land, she says, is meet up with other artists \"in whatever place that ends up being\". But as of now, no-one knows where that place is, or when the Hanjin Geneva will get to shore. \"Every day I hope will bring news that we will get into a port,\" says Rebecca. \"(But) nothing has changed.\"", "question": "When British artist Rebecca Moss was told over a ship 's breakfast one morning to sit down and brace herself for bad news , she was n't @placeholder to hear she was now stranded at sea .", "option_0": "expecting", "option_1": "intended", "option_2": "hopes", "option_3": "thrilled", "option_4": "promised"}

A consultation into the broadcaster's future was launched after the government carried out an 18-month review of the publicly-owned channel, which has more than 800 staff but fewer than 30 based outside central London. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said \"the benefits of this national asset to be spread far and wide, not just in London\" although Channel 4 has said a \"substantial relocation would be highly damaging\".

Toilet provision on long journeys, seating in stations, and punctuality were rated better than a year earlier. Hull Trains and the Heathrow Express scored joint first in the National Rail Passenger Survey - on 97%. Southern Rail, run by Govia Thameslink, had the worst customer satisfaction with 72%, but that is a 3% increase on 2016. The areas in which it scored higher marks for satisfaction were availability of seating, ticket buying facilities, and the choice of refreshments. But Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: \"These green shoots are fragile and need nurturing. \"This recovery will be under pressure from upgrade works, industrial relationship problems and rising passenger numbers. \"So the industry needs to keep a relentless, ongoing focus on performance and reliability.\" Last year, an industrial dispute between unions and Southern over the company's plan to change the role of guards on driver-only trains resulted in the most extensive industrial action in the rail industry for 23 years, with 58,983 Southern services were affected. By Richard Westcott, transport correspondent With the news full of strikes and delays, why are passengers becoming happier with their trains? The most likely answer is a slow rise in punctuality across many services, apart from the biggest franchise which includes Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern. You may not have felt it on your packed morning commute, but after struggling with ever-later trains for several years, punctuality levels having been rising a little for many people - from a pretty low point, mind you. And being on time is the number one priority for most travellers whether it's trains, planes or automobiles. Despite terrible reliability, even Southern's satisfaction levels are recovering, probably because the strikes are having less impact since the drivers stopped their walkouts - although that may change shortly. Thameslink, Great Northern, Great Western Railway and Southeastern were also among the low-scoring firm for satisfaction ratings in the survey - although Southeastern's score was up 10% on a year ago. Mr Smith added that customer satisfaction in London and south-east England had increased from 79% to 82%.

DUP ministers who resigned last month returned to the Northern Ireland Executive after the report's release. Mr Nesbitt said the report's findings vindicated his party's decision to pull out of the executive in August. He will address his party's annual conference at a hotel on the outskirts of Belfast later. Speaking at the conference on Saturday, former UUP leader Sir Reg Empey said that after the report on paramilitary activity stated that PIRA members believe that the provisional army council exists and oversees both PIRA and Sinn F¨¦in with an overarching strategy \"[First Minister] Peter [Robinson] goes back to business as usual sending the clear signal to Sinn F¨¦in that they can get away with it again. How awful\". He also said Sinn F¨¦in's denials about the IRA were \"sapping credibility out of politics and must be reversed if we are to create effective and acceptable devolution at Stormont\". Sir Reg added: \"It is true that Stormont has taken some good decisions, but conference, the present administration is the worst so far and is failing on nearly all fronts. This cannot be as good as it gets.\" The Ulster Unionists withdrew from government during the current political crisis at Stormont after allegations that IRA members had been involved in the murder of Kevin McGuigan Sr, one of its former members, in August.

But he added that if Mr Trimble had been avenged, \"maybe that's no bad thing\". Mr Trimble faced criticism from the DUP over sharing power with republicans. When the DUP agreed to the restoration of devolution in 2007, it insisted Sinn F¨¦in should accept the police and the IRA should completely decommission its weapons. But the findings of an assessment of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland earlier this week indicated that the IRA still has access to weapons, although its focus is wholly political. Mr Nesbitt said he had \"set out to do the right thing\" by removing the UUP from the executive, and the report had shown his decision was justified. \"I took a principled stand, I took an unambiguous stand that everybody understands, but having said all that, has David Trimble been avenged? \"People seem to think that he has and perhaps that is no bad by-product.\"", "question": "Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has said he is not seeking @placeholder on the DUP for its previous criticism of his party 's power - sharing with republicans .", "option_0": "criticism", "option_1": "options", "option_2": "clarity", "option_3": "representation", "option_4": "vengeance"}

{"id": 758, "article": "Lami, Maria and Hajara were at school in Chibok, north-eastern Nigeria, when they were kidnapped in April. Best friends Lami and Maria escaped by jumping from the back of a truck. Hajara was taken to a camp but later fled with another girl. To protect the girls' identity we have portrayed their story as an animation, and provided an edited transcript of their account below. The girls' names have been changed for their protection. Animation by Luis Ruibal. The BBC's 100 Women season runs online, on BBC World News TV and on BBC World Service radio from 27-29 October. Lami: It was Monday night. We had exams the following day. Then we started to hear shootings in the town. So we went out. We phoned our parents to tell them what was happening in the town. They told us to run away when we got the chance. We told them that the town was already surrounded so there was no way we could run. Maria: Lami woke me up saying: \"Maria didn't you hear what's happening? Haven't you heard sounds of shooting from the town?\" I said we should climb the wall and run away. She said: \"No. No-one has run away. We should gather in one place and wait to see what's going to happen.\" Other girls said nothing would happen to us. \"We're girls. They don't do anything to girls. We should wait and see what God would do.\" Lami: We were at the school when suddenly three Boko Haram members entered. They said: \"If any of you attempt to leave we'll kill all of you.\" When we went out they were everywhere. They gathered us where we have our school assembly. As we were there they kept burning the school. They burnt everything. Hajara: They asked us to get out of the gate, saying that when we were out they would let us go back to our homes. They said whoever did not have a headscarf or shoes should go and get them. They then asked us to climb on to a lorry, on top of the food loaded in it. The lorry was so high that we couldn't easily climb on. Maria: They said to us: \"You're only coming to school for prostitution. Boko (Western education) is haram (forbidden) so what are you doing in school?\" We kept quiet. I think there could have been about 100 Boko Haram members - they were all over the school. They outnumbered us. They took us away in their vehicles. We were sitting on oil drums in the vehicle. Our vehicle was really overloaded. We were saying to one another that we should throw away our shoes and scarves so that if our parents came they would know the road we had taken. Hajara: The vehicle became full before I could get on. There were about 100 of us walking. We stopped at one town and people brought us water. I saw one of those who brought us water changed his clothes and joined the Boko Haram men. They then put us in other vehicles. They put the rest in the boots of cars. Some of the Boko Haram members were so small that if I were to grab their necks I could break them. Some couldn't even carry their guns properly. Maria: We were wondering where we were being taken to. When we entered the vehicle, Lami said to me: \"Shouldn't we jump out of the vehicle here so that we may possibly escape? There are no other vehicles close by.\" Hajara: I thought, it's preferable to have these people shoot me as I run than have them humiliate me. They kept saying to us: \"Make sure you put on your scarves. Make sure you put on your scarves. We'll shoot any girl we see without a scarf. And any girl who jumps out will die.\" I was about to jump out when one girl held me back and said they'd shoot me if I did. \"What's the difference,\" I said. \"Is it not to the same death we're going? They should shoot me here and let my corpse be collected.\" I was crying and praying until we reached the camp. Lami: There was a lot of dust on the road, they couldn't see us. When we jumped out, we started to run. We were running without shoes. We found other people. We started to run away from them thinking they were Boko Haram. But they too had run from the town. Hajara: Boko Haram gathered us in a forest around noon. Some of the girls were tired and were lying down. But I couldn't lie down. The spirit of God was asking me to go. It was telling me: \"Get up and go. Get up and go.\" So I went. Another girl followed me. When we were going I saw some of them [Boko Haram members] performing ablutions. We stooped as if we were trying to pull out thorns from our shoes, as if we were just going to wee. We'd walk a little then bend down for a little while as if we were looking for something we'd lost. After walking for a while they couldn't see us properly since it was forest. We then started to run. After we had run for a short distance, we heard them saying \"catch those girls.\" We kept running. Whether they came after us not, we didn't know. Hajara: We kept going and our shoes were ripped. We found a house, where a girl could speak Hausa. Her parents gave us a place to sleep. We reached the Chibok area in the morning. A man looking for a relative among the missing girls drove us on motorbike into town. When I saw my elder and younger brothers, I fell to the ground crying. My mother and father were crying and all members of my family cried. Before I reached home it was as if there was a death in the house. Mats were spread. People were consoling my father and mother thinking that I had died. Who are Boko Haram? Profile: Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau Will 'truce' with Boko Haram free Chibok girls? Lami: The people we met said: \"Your town is far away. You can't go there now. Come here and wait until morning when we'll take you into the town to get transport back home.\" We stayed there till morning when they asked us to get up so that we go to the town. We couldn't walk. Our feet were full of thorns. They said: \"Let's go find a vehicle to take you home.\" Maria: The men who helped us took us to Chibok, and I cried. It was the second time that something like that had happened to me. My dad was a pastor; Boko Haram went to our house and killed him. They also shot my mum in the stomach; they gave her 2,000 Naira ($12) to have the bullet. Full coverage: 100 Women Lami: My parents warmed up water and cared for my feet. I was taken to the hospital and it was two weeks before I could stand up. Maria: I continued to live with the thought that Boko Haram members were coming to get me. I couldn't sleep. Hajara: I was having nightmares every day. There was even a day when I dreamed that they gathered all of us who fled in one place, and said to us: \"You girls have defied us and fled. We're now going to burn you alive.\" I haven't forgotten about the other girls who are still in the hands of those people. I keep praying for them. Lami: God will never make us meet these people again. And for our sisters who are still in the forest, may God help them. And may the whole world cry out for these girls to get out so that we continue with our education in school again. Maria: They should pray to God to forgive them their sins. I'd also ask them to bring back the girls they have kidnapped because their parents are in distress. Some of the parents of the girls have already died. It was the thought of their girls that killed them. Hajara: God will do what he wills, but I don't want to look at them because of what they have done to my life.

On the night in question, in 2002, I thought it would be a laugh to go to a 70s night with a bunch of friends at the newly re-opened Marquee Club in Islington, North London. Entering into the spirit of the occasion, I wore my shirt open to the waist and put on a gold medallion. When we arrived at the club, we discovered that we were the only two in our party of 20-odd who had raided the dressing-up box. But there was another, bigger surprise waiting for us at the Marquee. The bouncers insisted on us paying double the normal entry fee and I remember complaining bitterly that we'd each have to pay a tenner. As it turned out, that tenner was not the cost of dancing to old Marc Bolan tracks but the cost of attending Prince's after-show party. At around midnight, the naff 70s DJ was kicked off stage and Prince's road crew took over. For well over an hour they fiddled and faffed. Girls started to complain about their heels hurting. Boys talked of going for a few beers. I said that this was all a bit awkward as I had an early morning start at a party conference in Brighton. Prince - he'd just changed his name back to Prince - was in no rush. When he finally walked on stage in the early hours of the morning I remember thinking not just how small he was but how bizarre he looked in his Cuban heels and shades. Then he picked up his guitar and played, and all such thoughts disappeared. It was sublime. I was, as is no doubt obvious by now, no Prince fan, but boy this guy could play. And play he did - Automatic, Sign of the Times, Sexy Dancers and many more. He played not just his guitar but the sax and the keyboards and, it seemed, every instrument on stage. Those of us who were there that night - 20 or so of my friends and perhaps 300 people in total - looked at each other, grinned and nodded as if to say \"Can you believe this?

Speaking at a news conference in Melbourne, Brig Allfrey said the 12-13 February tour will be only the fourth time the Tattoo has travelled away from home in its 66-year history. Shipping over and assembling the replica of the historic fortress, which has dominated Edinburgh's skyline for centuries, is \"a huge job\", he said.

The final line-up is still \"under wraps\" but it will include bands from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere, and will also travel to New Zealand. Front of stage will be the traditional Scottish favourites including Britain's best precision drill teams, pipers, fiddlers and highland dancers. Brigadier Allfrey would not reveal how many planeloads or tonnes of equipment would be part of the tour, but joked that \"the uniforms alone are well over the luggage allowance of any normal airline.\" There will be no horses or jeeps, which have featured in previous Tattoos.

Mr Arpaio, 85, had boasted of being \"America's toughest sheriff\" during his time as the elected lawman of Maricopa County, which includes the city of Phoenix.

The data reveals that the number of foreign passport-holders resident in Germany had been overestimated. The total number of foreigners is 6.2 million - 1.1 million fewer than had been assumed. They make up 7.7% of the total population. The number of residents from a non-German background is 15 million - about 19% of the total. Hamburg has the highest proportion of ethnically non-German residents, at 27.5%. The figure for the capital, Berlin, is 23.9%. And in all the states of former East Germany the figure is less than 5%. The census also revealed that 66.8% of respondents consider themselves Christian, and 10.5% atheists. In eastern Germany, non-believers account for about 33% - far higher than the 6% figure for western Germany. Only 1.9% of respondents said they were Muslim. Statisticians believe many Muslims used their legal right not to state their religion in the survey, according to the news website, Der Spiegel. On home ownership, the census put the national figure at 45.8%, with Berlin right at the bottom. Only 15.6% of people in the capital are homeowners.

I've been out to meet Dave Walker, a man who has more than 25 video cameras scattered throughout his Worcestershire garden - inside nest boxes, trained on badger setts, even operated by remote control and scanning the whole garden. All that information pours into a central hub, with three large monitors for all the various video feeds. The best images can be found on their website. The woman responsible for the technical side of things is Kate MacRae, (or Wildlife Kate as Springwatch viewers may know her). She's wired her own Lichfield garden up with lots of cameras too. However, with Dave's garden she was able to start from scratch and the results are amazing. Some of the best footage is included in this blogpost. As these cameras improve in quality and drop in price Kate has top tips for getting the best out of them. She says you can use a portable, motion-controlled, \"trail camera\" to find the best spot for recording wildlife. Then you can hardwire a better camera into that position which allows you to record the action round the clock, rather than in short bursts.

It is a well-worn message for Mr Trudeau, but one he is keen to promote before North American Free Trade Agreement talks launch. Mr Trudeau spoke to the network from New York as he attended Canadian show Come From Away on Broadway. The musical production is based on the true story of how the small town of Gander, Newfoundland, welcomed some 7,000 air travellers stranded in the days after the 9/11 terror attacks when the US closed its airspace. It recently opened in New York City after a successful run in Canada, and its heart-warming storyline was the perfect medium to help transmit Mr Trudeau's message of the importance of the longstanding ties between the two countries. In remarks before the show, Mr Trudeau said: \"We have a friendship between our two countries that are like no other\". His press secretary said on Thursday that \"we embrace the opportunity to highlight how we are there for each other in times of need\". The audience on Wednesday was filled with political glitterati, included Ivanka Trump as a guest, who sat near to UN ambassador Nikki Haley and Mr Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau during the evening's entertainment. Mr Trudeau and Ms Trump had met previously when she helped host a summit on women business leaders and entrepreneurs when the Canadian prime minister visited Washington earlier this year. Mr Trudeau told NBC's Tom Brokaw that there is an opportunity to improve the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) in trade talks. US President Donald Trump wants to renegotiate Nafta, a 1994 trade deal that includes Canada and Mexico. In February, the president said the trade relationship between the two countries only needed \"tweaking\" - a word Mr Trudeau clearly remembers. \"(Nafta) has led to a lot of great jobs for a whole lot of people on both sides of the border and I very much take him at his word when he talks about just making a few tweaks,\" he told the network. \"Because that's what we're always happy to do.\" Trade relations with the US are crucial for Canada and Mr Trudeau and his ministers have repeatedly hammered home statistics over the past few months that underscore the importance of Canada to American commerce. Nearly nine million US jobs depend on trade and investment from Canada, while Canada is the top customer for 35 US states.

It is the first time a Serbian court has charged anyone over the massacre of 8,000 people by Bosnian Serb forces. The authorities in Bosnia and an international court in the Hague have carried out all previous prosecutions. The men charged on Thursday belonged to a special Bosnian-Serb police unit that was operating in the eastern village of Kravica when the killings took place just over 20 years ago. They herded the mainly Muslim victims into a warehouse where they were killed with machine guns and grenades in an assault that lasted all night, the prosecutor's statement said. Those charged included the unit's commander, Nedeljko Milidragovic, also known as Nedjo the Butcher, who was accused of giving the order for the killings and saying that \"nobody should get out alive\". Mr Milidragovic is already facing genocide charges in Bosnia but has been able to live freely in Serbia because of the lack of an extradition treaty, says the BBC's Guy De Launey in Belgrade. But this changed in March when he and the seven other suspects were arrested as a result of co-operation between the war crimes court in Belgrade and its counterpart in Sarajevo, our correspondent adds. Prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic said the charges were a \"message that there will be no impunity for war crimes and that the victims will not be forgotten\". The eight men could face a maximum sentence of 20 years if found guilty. Fourteen people have been convicted at the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague in relation to the Srebrenica killings. Former Bosnian Serb army chief Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic are both on trial at The Hague, accused of crimes relating to the massacre. The ICTY and the International Court of Justice have called the events genocide. The Srebrenica massacre came amid the bloody break-up of Yugoslavia into independent states in the 1990s. Serbia backed Bosnian Serb forces fighting the Muslim-led Bosnian government during the conflict. In July 1995, in what was supposed to have been a UN safe haven, Bosnian Serb forces took control of Srebrenica.

And danger is also never far away, with mechanics putting their lives on the line every race weekend, as this year's Spanish Grand Prix highlighted. There, only the quick feet of the McLaren jackman averted a collision when Fernando Alonso's brakes failed as he entered his pit box. Further down the pit lane, however, a Lotus mechanic was less fortunate. Romain Grosjean was unable to stop on a slippery surface and he clattered into the front jackman, pitching him into the air. Fortunately, he was unhurt, save for needing an ice pack to nurse a sensitive part of his body that had taken the full force of the handle of the jack he was holding. In a sport where every second counts, mistakes are impressively rare. For keeping the cogs of the F1 machine turning smoothly, mechanics are the stars of this, and any other season.

{"id": 802, "article": "It used data on bird strikes to get a sense of what would happen if a small drone collided with a plane. Only 3% of collisions between aircraft and birds similar in weight to domestic drones result in damage, found the George Mason University researchers. An even smaller number caused injuries to humans, it found, and many of these were caused by flocks of birds. The research project was prompted by the recent introduction of rules in the US that make owners of drones weighing more than 250g register their craft with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). \"Contrary to sensational media headlines, the skies are crowded not by drones, but by fowl,\" wrote Eli Dourado and Samuel Hammond in an article summarising their research. US airspace is home to about 10 billion birds, said the researchers, but collisions between fowl and aircraft have remained rare. The pair analysed 25 years of data gathered by the FAA on bird strikes to determine what damage a drone might do. Of the 160,000 bird strikes recorded since 1990, 14,314 caused damage, revealed the analysis. About 80% of the damage was done by birds such as turkey vultures and geese, which significantly outweigh domestic drones. About 97% of the strikes that involved small birds did no damage to the aircraft they hit, said the researchers. \"Given the voluntary nature of strike reporting, the true percentage of strikes causing damage is probably much lower, as strikes that do not cause damage can be either missed or under-reported,\" they wrote. The researchers did point out that because birds and drones are made of different materials, more damage might occur if a drone hits a plane. It urged the FAA to carry out research to determine the likely damage. While there have been wildlife strikes that did cause fatalities, none involved a bird that was similar in size to a domestic drone, they said. If drones collided with planes in the same proportion as birds do - roughly one bird in one million - then it could be a long time before any drone-aircraft impact does damage, they said. \"One damaging incident will occur no more than every 1.87 million years of 2kg [drone] flight time,\" said the researchers.

McLaren executive director Zak Brown said: \"Something needs to change.\" Brown had already said on Wednesday that he had \"serious concerns\" about Honda's ability to succeed in F1 and that the company appeared \"lost\" when it came to solving its problems with performance and reliability. The team have scored no points this season and McLaren cars have finished only four times in 12 races. Honda F1 boss Yusuke Hasegawa said: \"It is very difficult. It is very unfortunate we cannot convince them we can do that. From the results point of view, we demand much improvement. We need to do everything.\" He added: \"It is obviously a frustrating current situation and we are disappointed with our results so it is no wonder there is some complaining comments. \"But the things we can do is try our very best for the team and we are aiming to go in the same direction.\" Brawn added: \"We value Honda as part of the sport and if we can do anything to support their efforts to improve for the future we will do that.\" Asked about Brawn's comments, Hasegawa said: \"I appreciate his comments and I will ask him if we need his support.\" There is growing speculation that McLaren and Honda are nearing the point where their partnership will become untenable. The pair have a long-term contract but Brown has shifted from McLaren's previous position of being \"100% committed\" to the partnership. He said in an interview with BBC Sport on Friday at the Canadian Grand Prix: \"The plan right now is to have the Honda in the back of the car (in 2018) but some things need to happen between now and then for us to have the confidence we can be at the front of the field next year. \"We need to get competitive and show regular signs that we are getting competitive. \"Right now, we're not racing well, not finishing races and that can't happen any more. \"We are starting to work on the 2018 car so we need to make any decisions that impact 2018 by the summer break. Something needs to change. If you keep doing the same thing, you are going to get the same result. Maybe take some risks, do things they wouldn't normally do. Can't keep doing the same thing and expect things to change.\" He added: \"We have a plan B, a Plan C. We have some plans.\" At least one of those options is an approach to Mercedes to use their engines on a customer basis next year. McLaren-Honda's lack of performance is threatening their hopes of persuading two-time champion Fernando Alonso to stay with them next year. Brawn ruled out the F1 Group playing any role in trying to find the Spaniard a competitive car in 2018, as former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has been known to do with drivers in the past. Alonso said on Thursday that he would stay at McLaren if they were winning by September but that if they were not \"maybe it was time for a change of project\". Brown said: \"We want Fernando Alonso to stay. If we are not fortunate enough to keep him then we will find someone else. \"We have a lot of races between now and September so we will just focus on getting back up the field. That's what he wants and we want.\" Brawn's partner on the commercial side of the F1 Group, Sean Bratches, said he was confident of securing the future of the British Grand Prix despite the threat hanging over the race. Silverstone has strongly hinted it will activate a break clause that would end the contract after the 2019 race if F1 does not reduce its fee. The track's owners the British Racing Drivers' Club has until this year's race next month to action the clause. Bratches said: \"We are in conversations with the British Grand Prix and the team there and we are optimistic of having a long-term future of having a grand prix in Great Britain. \"We have three years to the last grand prix under the contract. So there is a lot of things that can happen in that period of time, notwithstanding what happens in the next three weeks.\" One likely scenario is that Silverstone will activate the break clause next month but that talks will continue between the two parties aimed at securing the future of the race beyond 2019 on the basis of a new contract.", "question": "Formula 1 technical and sporting boss Ross Brawn says he has @placeholder to help McLaren 's engine partner Honda with its performance problems .", "option_0": "offered", "option_1": "admitted", "option_2": "promised", "option_3": "resigned", "option_4": "plans"}

Researchers say hackers can use an insecure bluetooth device embedded in the toy to listen and talk to the child playing with it. Manufacturer Genesis Toys has not yet commented on the German warning. The Vivid Toy group, which distributes My Friend Cayla, has previously said that examples of hacking were isolated and carried out by specialists. However, it said the company would take the information on board as it was able to upgrade the app used with the doll. But experts have warned that the problem has not been fixed. The Cayla doll can respond to a user's question by accessing the internet. For example, if a child asks the doll \"what is a little horse called?\" the doll can reply \"it's called a foal\". A vulnerability in Cayla's software was first revealed in January 2015. Complaints have been filed by US and EU consumer groups. In addition to the data protection concerns, a hack allowing strangers to speak directly to children via the My Friend Cayla doll has been shown to be possible. Under German law, it is illegal to sell or possess a banned surveillance device. A breach of that law can result in a jail term of up to two years, according to German media reports. The warning by Germany's Federal Network Agency came after student Stefan Hessel, from the University of Saarland, raised legal concerns about My Friend Cayla. Mr Hessel, quoted by the German website Netzpolitik.org, said a bluetooth-enabled device could connect to Cayla's speaker and microphone system within a radius of 10m (33ft). He said an eavesdropper could even spy on someone playing with the doll \"through several walls\". A spokesman for the federal agency told Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily that Cayla amounted to a \"concealed transmitting device\", illegal under an article in German telecoms law (in German). \"It doesn't matter what that object is - it could be an ashtray or fire alarm,\" he explained.

{"id": 816, "article": "Seven of her relatives have been arrested, and accused of misusing their royal status to amass vast wealth and carry out numerous abuses. The crown prince himself has now made the disgrace official by ordering her family to stop using the name Akrapongpreecha, which he gave them after he married her in 2001. The king and the crown prince both have this privilege, akin to knighthoods in the UK. Interestingly, the crown prince has not revoked her royal title, \"Mom\", which translates roughly as \"princess\", nor yet her use of the royal family's name, Mahidol na Ayutthaya. These are officially bestowed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and it would need his approval for them to be revoked. However if, as expected, the crown prince divorces Princess Srirasmi, she will almost certainly lose both titles. The future status of her nine-year-old son by the prince, Dipangkorn, will depend on his father's wishes. Titles matter a great deal in status-obsessed Thailand, in particular when it comes to those with a claim to the throne. The 1924 Palace Succession Law, enshrined in subsequent constitutions, follows the principle of primogeniture, meaning Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn is the designated heir to King Bhumibol, and his own sons should inherit the throne after him, ranked by age. However, the law also gives reigning kings considerable sway in choosing their own successor - and an amendment to the constitution now allows the possibility of a female successor. The crown prince has four sons by his second marriage, whom he disowned in 1997 when he severed all ties with their mother, Yuvadhida Polpraserth. At the time the crown prince stated that they had renounced all their royal titles. But the palace continues to recognise their right to use the title HSH, or His Serene Highness, even though the boys, now grown up, are banished from Thailand and live in the United States. That leaves some doubt over where they sit in line to the throne, even though most commentators believe they are no longer considered possible successors. It is widely believed that the crown prince may have had another baby boy this year with his current mistress, who is likely to become his next wife. The issue is critical in a country where the monarchy is considered pivotal to political stability, and where King Bhumibol, who turns 87 this week, is in such frail health. Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn appears to be sorting out his personal affairs before the succession, so that he can choose who will be his queen, and who will eventually succeed him.", "question": "The downfall of Princess Srirasmi , the wife of Thailand 's Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn , has been both @placeholder and unusually public .", "option_0": "special", "option_1": "dramatic", "option_2": "widespread", "option_3": "further", "option_4": "notable"}

In return, Samsung is alleged to have given financial favours to Ms Park's confidante Choi Soon-sil, Yonhap said. The scandal has led to growing calls for Ms Park's resignation, but she has said the allegations are \"fantasy\". Ms Choi, who has been charged with coercion and attempted fraud, is accused of using her close relationship with Ms Park to obtain favours and funds for her own gain. Earlier this week prosecutors said Ms Park had a \"considerable\" role in the scandal. The allegations have enraged the South Korean public, and caused Ms Park's approval ratings to plummet. However, she has resisted the calls for her to resign and has yet to agree to be questioned by investigators. Her spokesman rejected the prosecutors' case as speculation built on \"a house of fantasy\". Samsung's offices had already been raided over related allegations. Wednesday's raid had to do with a merger last year between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries. The deal went through despite significant opposition from shareholders, who said it would hurt minority shareholders while benefiting the family of Samsung's group owner Lee Kun-hee. South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS), which owns stakes in both companies, sealed the deal by voting in favour of it. Prosecutors allege that Samsung gave a??2.8m euros ($3.1m;?¡ê2.5m) to a company co-owned by Ms Choi and her daughter, in return for Ms Park's support for the deal. Samsung was also among several conglomerates that gave millions of dollars to two non-profit foundations owned by Ms Choi, after the latter allegedly pressured them for donations. Samsung and the pension fund confirmed the raids without giving further details. Ms Park is accused of giving Ms Choi inappropriate access to government policy-making and decisions. She has since acknowledged that she committed lapses, and apologised twice on national television. Separately on Wednesday, Ms Park's office confirmed a report that they had bought hundreds of Viagra pills on behalf of the president.

The UK Intellectual Property Office (UK IPO) told BBC Scotland that her challenge had been successful. The Tea Rooms Trust has 28 days to appeal against the ruling. The Sauchiehall Street building and interiors were designed by Rennie Mackintosh and built in 1903 for Kate Cranston, who ran a number of tea rooms. Ms Mulhern, 60, transformed the Tea Rooms back to their original use in 1983 after the building had been used as a retail unit. However, she did not own the building and it was acquired by the Willow Tea Rooms Trust in 2014. The Trust recently closed the building for a ?¡ê10m two-year refurbishment. Meanwhile, Ms Mulhern, who also operates the Willow Tea Rooms on Buchanan Street, has moved her Sauchiehall Street operation to the third floor of the Watt Bros department store. The UK IPO said a 73-page ruling on the trademark dispute would be published next week. It said Ms Mulhearn's opposition to the Willow Tea Rooms Trust's trademark application had been successful because she had a similar existing trademark.

{"id": 832, "article": "In future, the SDF will, in principle, be able to assist the forces of a foreign country in situations where either the survival and security of Japan or that of its citizens is at risk. The new interpretation is highly controversial since it represents a sharp departure from the post-war political consensus, codified in Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, that explicitly limits Japan's use of military force exclusively to the defence of its sovereign territory and its people. Such has been the strength of post-war Japanese pacifist sentiment, and notwithstanding the long-term alliance with the United States, that Japan's defence forces have been unable to extend their military collaboration with their US allies beyond this narrowly circumscribed role. Under the new provisions, there are now a range of scenarios in which this type of joint defence activity might be expanded. Examples include providing defensive support to US forces under attack in the vicinity of Japan, co-operating militarily with US forces to safeguard Japanese citizens at risk overseas, participating in minesweeping activities during a time of war, or deploying Japanese forces to protect access to energy supplies or critically important sea-lanes of communication vital to Japan's survival. Indeed, in theory, the new interpretation will allow Japan to co-operate with any foreign country with which it has \"close ties\", thereby substantially expanding the scope for military co-operation with different countries and beyond the narrow remit of the defence of Japanese territory. Opinion in Japan is divided on the merits of this change, with 50%, according to a recent Nikkei poll, opposing the new interpretation and 34% supporting it. The motives for opposition are mixed, in part reflecting the unresolved debate about Japan's post-war political identity, but also prompted by uncertainty regarding the long-term security objectives of the Abe administration. Progressive thinkers argue that the changes overturn the pacifist legal and interpretative conventions, established in the aftermath of World War Two, guaranteeing that Japan will never again become embroiled in foreign conflicts. Given the sensitivity and importance of these political norms, critics argue they should only be changed via constitutional amendment. While the Abe administration dominates both houses of the Japanese parliament, it is uncertain of its ability to revise the constitution rapidly and critics view the new interpretation as one of dubious political legitimacy. There is also some fear, both within Japan and amongst its closest neighbours, most notably China and South Korea, that the new interpretation is intended to allow the government to deploy troops freely in a wide-range of conflict situations. However, the Abe administration has explicitly ruled out such options and has been careful to distinguish between collective self-defence (intended to safeguard Japanese national interests and assets) and collective security - where states co-operate to protect their mutual interests in the face of foreign aggression. Mr Abe himself has made it clear that Japan's forces will not \"participate in combat in wars such as the Gulf War and the Iraq War\". Mr Abe appears to have a number of motives for introducing the new interpretation. It will provide Japan with much greater latitude to strengthen its military co-operation with the United States - something that Washington is keen to encourage as part of the current revision of the Joint US-Japan Defence Guidelines, unchanged since 1997. It will also open the door potentially to more active defence co-operation with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region, such as Australia and the Philippines - both of which have welcomed these changes, as they look anxiously at China's increasingly assertive maritime posture in the South and East China seas. More generally, the new interpretation is likely to strengthen the perception that Japan has become a more \"normal\" state, in terms of its ability constructively to contribute to global and regional security. The political and diplomatic dividends from such a change in attitudes are likely to be considerable, potentially strengthening Japan's long-standing bid for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and adding weight to Mr Abe's recently articulated strategy of making a \"proactive contribution to peace\". The new approach is not without risk. While Japan's mainstream political parties remain weak and divided, citizen activism in opposition to these changes may be energised, particularly at the level of local politics. Prefectural, city, town and village-based criticism of the government's approach has been vocal and may cost the government support in the spring elections of 2015. Abroad, the new measures look set to further undermine an already frayed relationship with South Korea and to heighten territorial and political tensions with China. Finally, the intentional ambiguity surrounding the details of the new interpretation provides the government with useful flexibility in deploying its forces overseas, but it also magnifies the potential for increased tactical and strategic risk at a time when regional security tensions are intensifying. For a Japanese government that has limited experience of the high-pressure challenge of national security decision-making and crisis management, this may not be an entirely positive development.

{"id": 834, "article": "They say 40% of coral has died at the Dongsha Atoll in the South China Sea. Nothing as severe has happened on Dongsha for at least 40 years, according to experts. Anne Cohen of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, US, said the high water temperatures of 2015/16 were devastating for reef systems globally, including Dongsha. Coral bleaching - where corals turn white and may die - was the worst on record for Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef in 2016. The barrier reef has absorbed a lot of the attention, but other reefs around the world were also severely affected, said Dr Cohen. \"The 2015/2016 El Nino was devastating for reef systems in other parts of the world as well, including Dongsha Atoll and reefs in the central Pacific, where some of the most pristine coral reefs are located and of course, the US Pacific Remote Marine National Monument,\" she said. \"We observed devastating bleaching in that area as well.\" Only last week, scientists published observations of three major die-offs of coral at the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, 2002 and 1998. They concluded that the only way to preserve the world's coral reefs is to take drastic action to reduce global warming. The study of the Dongsha Atoll, reported in the journal, Scientific Reports, echoes this finding. \"Based on what we observed on Dongsha, a 2 degree cap on ocean warming may not be enough to save coral reefs,\" Dr Cohen told BBC News. \"This is because coral reefs are shallow water ecosystems and a tweak in the local weather can turn that 2 degrees Celsius into a 6 degrees Celsius warming.\" The Dongsha Atoll, located in the South China Sea, near south-eastern China and the Philippines, is rich in marine life and is regarded as one of the world's most important coral reefs. The researchers said on its own, a 2 degrees Celsius rise in temperatures was unlikely to cause widespread damage to coral reefs in the region. But, a high-pressure system caused temperatures to spike to 6 degrees, leading to the death of 40% of coral over the course of six weeks. They argue that predictions of the future of coral reefs may be \"overly optimistic\" for some reefs in shallow water. Bleaching happens when high water temperatures cause corals to expel the algae they depend upon.

{"id": 839, "article": "Fast forward 21 years and Rovers are now struggling in the second tier, the Toffees have not won another major trophy and Palace have made 16 permanent managerial changes. Bartlett, remarkably, remains boss of the Stones. As the 60-year-old prepares the National League South club for Saturday's FA Cup fourth qualifying round tie at Dagenham & Redbridge - one of 32 taking place this weekend - the London-born PE teacher is proof that longevity is achievable in a game where knee-jerk reactions and sackings are commonplace. FA Cup fourth qualifying round fixtures FA Cup 2016-17 qualifying results \"Most chairmen tend to go through countless managers. I'm the opposite, I go through chairmen,\" said Bartlett. He is the longest-serving manager in England's top six tiers having been appointed 16 months before Arsene Wenger's first match in charge of Arsenal in October 1996. Since taking charge of Wealdstone, Bartlett has overseen 1,250-plus competitive games, served four different chairmen and won four promotions, while the club, now based in Ruislip, have played \"home\" games at three different grounds. Such devotion and loyalty might prompt a club to commission a statue in tribute. Bartlett, however, is more than satisfied with the decanter and watch he received at a testimonial dinner, attended by Tottenham legend Steve Perryman and former Watford boss Aidy Boothroyd, in 2010 to mark 15 years in charge. \"It's not about Gordon Bartlett and 21 years as manager of Wealdstone. It's about what we can achieve collectively as a group and as a team,\" Bartlett said. \"When I first took over at Wealdstone we had no ground, just two players and we were in administration. We started from scratch.\" Highlights for Wealdstone under Bartlett's rule include FA Cup first-round pay days against Rotherham in 2009 and Colchester in 2015, and a ¡ê70,000 transfer fee from Leeds United for striker Jermaine Beckford in 2006. There have been lows too. \"Three years ago I came very close to quitting after we lost to Concord Rangers in the Isthmian League play-offs,\" said Bartlett. \"Part of my longevity is because I have surrounded myself with super people and I was persuaded to stay on. The following season we finished top and were promoted to National League South.\" Vinnie Jones, an FA Cup winner with Wimbledon in 1988, and former England captain Stuart Pearce both started their careers at Wealdstone before Bartlett arrived. In addition to Boothroyd, Bartlett has forged long-term friendships with former Watford managers Sean Dyche and Malky Mackay, while ex-England striker Les Ferdinand played under him as a teenager. Wealdstone are one league below Dagenham & Redbridge, who are second in the National League table having been relegated from League Two last season. The Daggers are also managed by a veteran, with 66-year-old John Still in his third spell in charge, the first of which came in 1992. Despite being underdogs, Bartlett has been around long enough to know his side can join former winners Bolton Wanderers, Coventry City and Portsmouth in Monday's first-round draw. So has he got a date in mind to retire from management? \"As long as I can take Wealdstone forward and I have fire in my belly, I will continue,\" he added. Should Stourbridge keeper Matthew Gould require an insight into the magic of the FA Cup he only needs to give his grandad a phone call. Bobby Gould masterminded Wimbledon's 1988 triumph over Liverpool - arguably the biggest upset in the competition's history. The former Wales boss later revealed he had got closer than most to the famous trophy after tucking it into his bed after his \"Crazy Gang\" had won. \"Grandad often mentions he slept with the FA Cup,\" said Gould, 22, who is set to feature for Stourbridge in their tie at Northern Premier League Premier Division rivals Nantwich Town on Saturday. \"I wasn't born when Wimbledon won the cup but I've watched it back a couple of times with grandad. \"It was quite an incredible group of players he had. It was a bit like Leicester winning the Premier League last season. It gives everyone hope.\" Gould, son of former Celtic and Coventry keeper Jonathan, was back-up at Livingston last season, who were playing in the Scottish Championship, before joining Scottish League One Stenhousemuir on an emergency loan in November. After returning to Livingston, he finished the season on loan at Stourbridge before agreeing a one-year contract with the Glassboys in May. It is a handy arrangement as his dad is goalkeeper coach at nearby West Bromwich Albion, where Stourbridge's keeper spends his week training with the likes of England international Ben Foster and Boaz Myhill. \"I'm very fortunate that Tony Pulis allows me to train with them because of my dad,\" added Gould. \"You cannot buy that experience. I'm learning something new every day.\" Stourbridge are managed by Gary Hackett, the former Stoke City and West Brom winger, who is looking to guide his hometown club to the FA Cup first round for the fifth time in eight seasons. Will FA Cup-winning boss Bobby Gould be making the journey to Nantwich to cheer on the Glassboys? \"Grandad comes to a lot of home games - we've managed to convert him into a Stourbridge fan,\" laughed Gould. \"He's got other commitments this weekend but I'm sure he'll be looking out for our result.\" Deren Ibrahim plans to round off a week he will never forget by guiding Dartford into the FA Cup first round. Ibrahim, 25, conceded the fastest World Cup qualifying goal 8.1 seconds into his Gibraltar debut as Belgium ran out 6-0 winners on Monday. Instead of facing Belgium's ¡ê27m Crystal Palace striker Christian Benteke and Chelsea's Eden Hazard on Saturday, Ibrahim will be up against Nathan Elder and Luke Blewden as National League South Dartford visit Kent neighbours Tonbridge Angels. \"It'll be a bit different for him after facing the likes of Benteke and Hazard,\" Steve McKimm, manager of Isthmian League Premier Division side Tonbridge Angels told BBC Radio Kent.

The original game was played on part of the Bowhill Estate called the Carterhaugh peninsular - between the Ettrick and Yarrow Waters, near Selkirk. Around 1,000 men are estimated to have taken part while another 2,000 spectators cheered on the teams from Selkirk and Yarrow. Organised by Sir Walter Scott, James Hogg and the fourth Duke of Buccleuch, the game was accompanied by pipes, banners and wild celebrations. The game was re-created as part of a day-long celebration event on Friday, which included a traditional hand ba' game played by local enthusiasts. The re-enactment was officially started by the current Duke of Buccleuch, who threw a ball in the air. In a narrated interpretation of the original game, it featured a local re-enactment group, drummers, flagbearers, halberdiers, musketeers and jesters. The event was organised by The Bill McLaren Foundation and Bowhill House - the Selkirk home of the Duke of Buccleuch.", "question": "A @placeholder game of Borders \" football \" has been re-created on the site of the original match .", "option_0": "renowned", "option_1": "separate", "option_2": "historic", "option_3": "major", "option_4": "hereditary"}

{"id": 850, "article": "An hour or two after the action subsides and Murrayfield falls silent, the players file out to greet supporters queuing in the shadows of the towering west stand. A throng of youngsters draped in Saltires, cheeks caked with face paint, necks craned over the barrier fence awaiting the emergence of their heroes, confronts them. For Watson, the penning of signatures and distributing of kit bears particular significance. A decade ago, it might have been him at the heart of the clamour. \"Me and my brother always used to queue up for autographs after the games,\" the flanker recalls. \"It's quite funny now me coming out and chucking my socks to them. I always try and give my shorts and socks away because I remember how much I loved it when I got a pair after a game. \"I think on one occasion I got Dan Parks' and a few others. When we were kids it was so exciting to get autographs, so I always try and give stuff away.\" Watson may be 25, but he's still a kid himself in international terms, a fledgling of five caps, two of them as substitute. His, however, was a deeply compelling autumn. He played every minute of Scotland's trio of Tests, battling blow-for-blow on the open-side flank with Australian titans David Pocock and Michael Hooper, the livewire Argentine Pablo Matera, then the hulking totem of Georgian rugby, Mamuka Gorgodze. \"It was amazing, it was great to get a run of games and actually start a few back-to-back,\" he says. \"You're coming up against internationals every week for your club, but you're only playing four or five of them. \"Against a whole team of them, the main thing you notice is it's a lot quicker and a bit more physical, so you've got to get all your carries perfect and roles right. \"The nerves before that first start against Australia in front of a packed Murrayfield were pretty massive - I still get nervous for Edinburgh games, so I don't think that'll ever go away, but I'm not one to throw up.\" Watson was born in Manchester, but is eligible for Scotland through his grandparents. He attended Oakham School near Leicester, from where he would hop in a taxi after class and ride 40 minutes to Scottish Exiles training in Nottingham. His teenage toil yielded a coveted berth in Leicester Tigers' academy, then a jaunt on the World Sevens Series with Scotland, and finally, an elite development contract in the nation's capital. In his six seasons riding the maddening Edinburgh rugby rollercoaster, Watson has played under three head coaches, and wildly contrasting strategies. He signed amid the borderline kamikaze attacking days of Michael Bradley, grafted through the rigid era of Alan Solomons, while interim head coach Duncan Hodge is now trying to forge a successful marriage of the two. \"Under 'Bradders' our attack was amazing, everyone knew Edinburgh could score 50-plus points, but our defence was dreadful,\" Watson says. \"Alan came in, consolidated Edinburgh, made them a solid mid-table team and very hard to beat at home. \"We were known for having an amazing set-piece, but maybe lacked in scoring tries. Now, our attack's looking very good, our defence is good, but we're sometimes a bit off-it. We've got to find a good equilibrium. \"I think Hodgey's given the boys slightly more freedom in attack, more freedom to push those offloads, which has helped. \"We've scored quite a lot of tries off the back of that. The attack, we're playing at a higher tempo, he's tried to change training up a bit, and he's an attack coach, so he's brought lots of his styles from Scotland. It's given him a bit more freedom to push through his attack.\" Edinburgh's form this season, however, is enough to drive the most placid of supporters to the brink of insanity. In October, they beat Harlequins, then lost to Zebre. They beat Ulster, then lost to Dragons. A fortnight ago, they trailed Stade Francais by 17 points at half-time, had Phil Burleigh sent off, and yet salvaged victory in pulsating fashion. Last week, they were 23 points down to Stade at half-time and only just failed to repeat those heroics. For too many seasons, Edinburgh have festered like this. So much fleeting promise; so little tangible success. One step forward, two back. There can be few teams who persistently torment their fans in such fashion. \"It's not just the fans, it's massively frustrating as a player as well, and it's hard to put your finger on it,\" Watson says. \"We still haven't given an 80-minute performance this season. Even against Quins, we were amazing, we won the game, but we let them come back into it, and the same against Ulster, we had a late scare. \"I think that'll come - we're quite a young squad, so every game these young players are getting more and more experienced. \"If we manage to keep all of our players, we will be a very strong squad in a few years - it will be a very good squad if we keep our young, exciting players.\" Two of them - back-rower Magnus Bradbury, 21, and 19-year-old full-back Blair Kinghorn - have committed themselves to staying in the capital until 2020 and 2019 respectively, while Watson is keen to extend his own contract beyond the end of the season. More immediately, he is eager to help Edinburgh cling on to the 1872 Cup - a trophy they have lifted the past two seasons despite their struggles, and the continued good form of rivals Glasgow Warriors. \"We've had the edge the last two years, but these are the games Edinburgh never struggle with,\" he says. \"These are the games you don't have to get psyched up for. It's the ones like Zebre at home, Dragons away, we need to start winning. \"Every game, you always feel you're ready, but maybe mentally you're not quite ready. But those are the games we've got to win, and that's the big difference in the league at the moment.\" If Edinburgh are to finally sustain anything like their best form for more than a fleeting burst, the affable breakaway will surely have a few more pairs of socks to dish out come the Six Nations.", "question": "A poignant routine unfolds after each home Scotland international that Hamish Watson is @placeholder to savour .", "option_0": "known", "option_1": "prepared", "option_2": "learning", "option_3": "destined", "option_4": "continuing"}

Ms Saa agrees that there need to be wider conversations on the issue. \"The problem is not just in being a victim but also your victimisation by the society.

The results have forced researchers to rethink and they will now include pine martens in the survey. They are now recruiting volunteers to take the project forward and get a better picture of both the red squirrel and pine marten populations in Northern Ireland. The Fermanagh Citizen Science Red Squirrel Project originally set up cameras in 70 woodlands across the county. The aim of the project was to monitor the Fermanagh red squirrel population. The species was once common in Ireland but has been battling for survival ever since the grey squirrel was introduced from North America over 100 years ago. Fermanagh and the Glens of Antrim remain the only red squirrel strongholds in Northern Ireland.

Ms Hendricks called for the reactors to be taken offline in response to a report by Germany's independent Reactor Safety Commission.

Two states, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland Palatinate, have said they will take legal action against Belgian plans to extend the life of the two reactors until 2025.

Pte Williams, 22, from Hengoed, Caerphilly county, was made to do intense exercise as punishment at for a series of drunken incidents in 2006. He later died from heart failure in hospital as a result of heatstroke. The drug ecstasy was in his blood at the time of his death at Lucknow Barracks in Tidworth, Wiltshire, on 3 July 2006, the inquest in Salisbury was told. Dr Rowena French helped treat Pte Williams in the medical centre at the barracks when he felt unwell, and said she had been aware \"beasting\" took the form of physical training on camp. Dr French said Pte Williams had claimed to be passing blood in his urine, but she had not been informed about him collapsing or complaining of stomach pain - so she did not have heat injury in mind. \"It wasn't portrayed to me at the time as being any great emergencya€| it was standard,\" she said.

{"id": 885, "article": "They say the justice system has failed them. But the province's criminal prosecutions office says none of the allegations met the burden of proof necessary for indictments. The shocking 2015 allegations led to calls for an inquiry into policing. The story in Quebec is unfolding as law enforcement across the country is under growing scrutiny of the relationship between police and First Nations people in Canada. The high-profile case began last year, when a number of women went public with their allegations to investigative news program \"Enquete\", describing intimidation, abuse of power, and sexual and physical abuse by provincial police stationed in Val d'Or, a town of 31,000 people some 530km (330 miles) northwest of Montreal. Soon after, the Quebec government ordered a wide-ranging inquiry into the allegations, with the investigation handled by Montreal police. Six Quebec provincial police officers from Val d'Or were suspended with pay during the investigation. The police eventually handed over 37 files to Crown prosecutors. On Friday, the Crown gave a rare explanation of its decision not to press charges at a news conference in Val d'Or, saying they hoped the transparency would help bolster faith in the process. Prosecutors said they had no reason not to believe the women's allegations but  did not think they could prove them in court. \"We have to be clear that the fact that charges have not been laid doesn't mean that the events did not take place. The burden on the Crown is very high. We have to show that the suspect is guilty beyond reasonable doubt,\" said Sylvain Petitclerc. The Crown said in a number of cases there was insufficient evidence to identify a suspect. In other cases, they failed to find enough overall evidence.  In three cases, the allegations were made by a third party and later denied by the potential complainant. In one instance the suspect had died. The Crown did file charges against two retired police officers from Schefferville, another rural Quebec community, on alleged crimes dating back to the 1980s and 1990s. But Edith Cloutier, with the Val-d'Or Native Friendship Centre,  called Val d'Or \"ground zero\" for the accusations, and said the lack of charges has renewed calls for an independent inquiry into systemic racism and the relationship between police and aboriginal people in Quebec. The province has repeatedly rejected that request from federal and provincial indigenous groups. \"Those women forgot their fear, broke their silence, finally spoke out,\" Ms Cloutier said. \"The system has failed to protect them.\" Assembly of First Nations Regional Chief for Quebec-Labrador Ghislain Picard said simply: \"It's clear there is a very wide gap between justice and its application to indigenous people.\" In April, Quebec setup a confidential hotline indigenous people could call to file complaints of police abuse. Montreal police force have been tasked with investigating all the allegations of abuse against indigenous people unless they are against one of their own. Allegations flagged to police since April are still under investigation.

There was no pollution reported in the Dalmore Bay area, but a slight sheen was detected as the aircraft continued to follow the path of the rig.

{"id": 899, "article": "In the future, 2016 may be remembered as the year in which Westerners lost faith in the liberal story. It may therefore be remembered as the counterpoint to 1989. In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism, it seemed that the liberal story had won. The liberal story says that humankind is inevitably marching towards a global society of free markets and democratic politics. Those who willingly join the march of history by opening their borders and liberalising their markets and politics will be rewarded with peace and prosperity. Those who refuse to liberalise and globalise are doomed to failure. Bill Clinton, for example, confidently told the Chinese government that its refusal to liberalise Chinese politics put it \"on the wrong side of history\". In the 1990s and 2000s, the liberal story shaped not only the foreign policy of the United States and its allies, but also the domestic policies of governments across the world, from South Africa to Indonesia. However, since the global financial crisis of 2008, people all over the world have become increasingly disillusioned with the liberal story. It is no longer so clear that the Chinese Communist Party is on the wrong side of history, and authoritarian rulers such as Putin, Erdogan and Netanyahu are taking their countries in distinctly illiberal directions. The year 2016 - marked by the Brexit vote in Britain and the rise of Donald Trump in the United States - signifies the moment when this tidal wave of disillusionment has reached the liberal heartland of Western Europe and North America. Whereas a few years ago Americans and Europeans were still trying to liberalise Iraq and Libya at the point of the gun, they now have second thoughts even about American democracy and European identity. More and more Americans and Europeans are convinced that liberalisation and globalisation are a huge fraud that serves the interests of a tiny elite at the expense of the masses. In the long run, however, 2016 may turn out to be similar to 1968, 1933 and 1914. On all these previous occasions, Westerners lost faith in the liberal story only to eventually embrace it again. The people who voted for Hitler and Mussolini eventually built the West German and Italian democracies, and the youngsters who rioted in 1968 eventually went on to become Wall Street traders and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.

{"id": 901, "article": "Newspapers used to take a chunk of page two for the editor to trumpet the (sometimes selective use of) circulation figures, and \"how much better we've been selling than our down-market, parochial rival rag\" - or similar. You don't see that so much now, because none of the sales figures are to be trumpeted. Newspapers remain an important pillar of Scottish life, politics, culture and identity.  The four city-based titles are all more than 200 years old - The Scotsman and Courier reaching that milestone in the past year. They don't do much to report on themselves. Yet there's rarely been so much interest and discussion of news and how it is reported. The constitutional debates about Scotland and Brexit excite theories of newspaper conspiracy, and over-powerful proprietors. Social media has given access to everyone, on an equal basis, to have their say, where many are contemptuous or dismissive of \"the MSM\" (mainstream media) or \"dead tree press\". One such conspiracy theorist has taken up residence in the White House, and is using that \"bully pulpit\" to trash the big news brands.  Fake news, he says. Fake. Sad.  His people have \"alternative facts\".  There may be lessons there for us all. More of President Trump later. Close to home turf for me, this week brought an unusual sensation. For the first time in 28 years as a journalist, I'm working for an organisation that has ambitious plans for significant expansion. A digital TV channel for Scotland, including an hour-long news programme, viewing Scotland, the UK and the world from a Scottish studio, is an exciting prospect. To have spent nearly three decades inside an industry in gradual and then more rapid decline, facing cuts, job losses and narrowing ambitions, takes its toll. It's more difficult to be creative and bold in that environment, or to take risks. So this could change. It brings 80 more journalists at the BBC, and the opportunity to try new approaches to news. To its credit, STV has got to a similar plan, and earlier. If there's one thing we envy of our broadcast rivals just along the south bank of the Clyde, it's the ability to take decisions quickly. It is doing so by taking the city TV licences for Glasgow and Edinburgh, adding Dundee, Aberdeen and Ayr later this year, and making a sort of national network. That may somewhat undermine the intended spirit of local TV, but it's an innovative response in a changing market. The newspapers gave the BBC's initiative far more coverage than their own part of the industry. Broadcasters fill a lot of column inches, from plundering political interviews to personal dramas about soap opera stars, generating a steady flow of on-screen celebrity. It was down to the BBC, and to the media trade press and websites, to report the full-year sales figures for so-called 'regional' newspapers, which were published this week by the industry's audit organisation. They were all down. The National led the charge, falling 30% to 8,500 daily sales. That somewhat undermines the arguments that other papers are suffering the consequence of being out of kilter with the political zeitgeist. Political slant doesn't matter half as much as political people think. The National may yet be viable, because it has the back office management, advertising sales and printing capacity of the Herald and Evening Times group. The National can pursue its strongly pro-independence agenda with very few resources; a small number of young journalists, a very imaginative graphic designer, and its in-house Wee Ginger Dug. More worrying is the plight of The Scotsman. Sales were down 14% to below 20,000.  More than 2,000 of them are given away for free. The daily provides the infrastructure for Scotland on Sunday, which saw sales down 26% on the second half of 2015. The Edinburgh Evening News, also in that group, was down 16% to 18,400 - more than the other three city \"evening\" titles. (They're not really evening papers now, so much as local. Almost all their content is in place before that day's morning titles.) Many of these titles attract much bigger audiences for their online news, which is free to access. But few offer reliable, audited figures. The Scotsman's number is just under 100,000 visitors per day: The Herald at 88,000. No-one is getting rich from the advertising that comes with online news. There's recent evidence that, for all its falling sales, print still gets much more time than the written word on screen, and advertisers pay heed to such evidence. Saturday sales illustrate that.  Even at much higher prices, many titles see their print sales lift at the weekend.  The Guardian sells around 8,000 on the average weekday in Scotland, but that nearly doubles on Saturday. Many people seem to prefer a paper to a computer screen when they're kicking back over brunch. The Scotsman group is burdened with its proprietor's enormous debts. Johnston Press, also based in Edinburgh, is under siege from an activist investor, now with a 20% stake, which seems to have lost faith in the JP management and strategy. That strategy is to invest in its new acquisition of the 'i' low-price quick read, which grew out of The Independent. It gives Johnston a UK-wide reach for advertising. The group has had to sell some of its 200-plus local titles, including those in Ireland, the Isle of Man and East Anglia.  More are on the sales block, though it seems Johnston want to retain The Scotsman as its best-known brand. Industry insiders say DC Thompson, owner of The Courier, Press & Journal and Sunday Post, would be interested in taking on The Scotsman stable, at the right price. The Dundee family firm has shown a knack for adapting in this exceptionally difficult market, by staying close to readers. But Johnston Press seems determined to soldier on as things are. It may be that the going price for The Scotsman falls far short of what its creditors require. This has been good news for The Times, which is picking off chunks of the Edinburgh region up-market readership. Its editor, Magnus Llewellin, attributes that to investment in journalism. It has been poaching some of the more experienced writers in Scottish news and sport, including Mr Llewellin himself, formerly editor of The Herald. Beyond that, it has been much smarter than others at bundling print sales with subscriptions.  It has sent the message that if you want quality news, you should pay for it, starting with teaser subscriptions rates. It helps that the Times website is a coherent fit with the print product. Too many other papers want to draw readers across to their online journalism, only to find that it looks and feels very different. That can undermine the brand. The Times' subscription approach takes time and deep pockets. The title's ultimate boss, Rupert Murdoch, did something similar with Sky television. It's worked, and squeezed out rivals, from BSB to Setanta. All this is with the backdrop of conventional news sources being trusted less. As with other institutional pillars, there's a desire to kick over the old order, and replace it with... well, what? Citizen journalism? Websites driven from a political conviction, and crowd-funded? The cacophony of social media? Getting attention by being outrageous? Endlessly challenging the mainstream media to be more accountable? That is where Donald Trump is dragging the debate in the USA. The industry there is much more given to navel-gazing. It has been asking whether it covered the Trump campaign phenomenon as it should, and how it now covers the presidency. If every unwelcome news report is to be challenged, or denounced as fake news, and if the mis-statements and hypocrisy of Mr President simply meet with a shrug, how should they cover the White House? (And having seen some of these 'trash-the-messenger' tactics used in two referendums on this side of the Pond, how would a further Scottish referendum be reported any differently from last time?) Today, the question is how you report the president when the awkward squad of mainstream news outlets  - including the BBC - is excluded from briefings. I'm reminded of a friend who was a White House correspondent in the early 1970s. He was blacklisted by President Richard Nixon when he wrote that he had been given an ashtray with the presidential seal on it, which he was using as a water bowl for his dog. One answer to being excluded, I'd humbly suggest, is: wear it with pride. Don't play their game. If you're not being excluded by the Trump White House, ask what you're doing wrong. You can do your job with the information that's publicly available. In any case, what would you miss?

{"id": 905, "article": "Male circumcision is legal in the Netherlands but the body representing the country's doctors wants to end the practice. The association is urging politicians to put it on the political agenda. It is asking parents to think twice before having their sons circumcised because it regards the procedure as dangerous and unnecessary. Yet others see it as the latest reflection of a political shift in a country that is increasingly pressuring religious groups to stop practising what they preach. The figures vary but it is estimated that globally 30% of men are circumcised, with about 15,000 boys undergoing the procedure here in the Netherlands every year. In much of Africa, it is seen as a rite of passage in becoming a man, with boys being taken \"to the bush\" to spend days hidden away in this ceremonial transition. In the United States, it is still a relatively common procedure. However, there is a growing lobby opposing it in many parts of the US. In some states, support for the practice remains strong - protesters in San Francisco have just lost their battle to have it banned. The World Health Organization says circumcision can help prevent HIV and that, if done properly, there is little chance of complications. But here in the Netherlands, some doctors disagree. Gert van Dijk is a medical ethicist and one of the authors of the RDMA's anti-circumcision advice. 'We feel circumcision is a medically unnecessary form of surgery. The patient has to give consent, but children can't give consent and we feel that is wrong and a violation of the child's rights,\" he said. \"In our code of medical ethics, it states that you must not do harm to the patient, but with this procedure this is exactly what you're doing.\" The RDMA are fighting against what is a deeply entrenched religious practice. It is written in the Islamic text the Hadith that Muslim men should \"cut the things that grow\". Ibrahim Wijbenga is a Muslim member of the Christian Democratic Appeal in the city of Eindhoven. He was circumcised as a child and, following the family tradition, he had his son circumcised too. Ibrahim thinks claims that these discussions are medically motivated are nonsense and is campaigning to save the practice. \"It's not that we do something illegal or that we use a rusty knife. The boys in question are anaesthetised so they are looked after by the doctors. \"The motivation is plain Islamophobia. It's not a discussion about medical ethics, it's to make a lot of bad propaganda against Muslims and about our way of life and our religion,\" Mr Wijbenga said. \"Basically, it's an effort to stop Muslims from entering Holland.\" Jews, too, fear these anti-circumcision discussions are a serious threat to their faith. \"It's written in the Torah, in the Bible, that we should circumcise the child when the child is 8 days old. What God tells us to do, we must do,\" said Rabbi Jacobs, one of the Netherlands' most senior religious leaders. He said that being advised not to circumcise babies would have a dramatic impact on the estimated 30,000 Jews living in the Netherlands. For him, it is worse than being told they cannot cultivate kosher meat. 'I can import (kosher meat) or choose to not eat it, but with circumcision I'm stuck. Even if I take my child to a different country to do it, once I come back the doctor will see that there has been a circumcision and put me in jail. \"If you interfere with this practice, it will totally end the Dutch Jewry in the Netherlands.\" Even within the Jewish community, some - albeit a tiny minority - believe circumcision can leave a lasting psychological as well as a physical scar. \"He's grabbed, his legs are pulled apart, and they cut off part of his penis. Now what does it do to the boy's mind? I think it's wrong. I think boys or men have to decide for themselves.\" Michael Schaap is speaking from experience. His Jewish parents had him circumcised as a baby. He believes it is \"morally wrong to cut off any part of another person's body when there is no medical reason to do it. It's mutilation\". Michael made the controversial documentary \"Mum, Why Was I Circumcised?\" partly motivated by the anger he felt throughout his teenage years. \"When you do it with a boy, there's no way back. I don't know how sex would be with a prepuce. It made me angry that somebody else decided for me, to do something that I probably would not have done if I was deciding for myself.\" Politicians here in The Hague have yet to respond to this increasingly intense public debate, which coincides with the imminent outlawing of ritual slaughter and the proposed burka ban. Now many Muslims and Jews are concerned their fundamental traditions are under threat and that circumcision may be the next element of religious freedom to be withdrawn.

The lawsuit centres on publicity surrounding his arrest last month by police probing a major hack into the phone and broadband provider's website. Details of the case emerged after some reporting restrictions were lifted. The three newspapers defending the action - The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail and The Sun - all gave undertakings to protect the boy's identity pending the outcome of the case. The judge at the High Court in Belfast also granted injunctions against Google and Twitter in a bid to remove any online references to the teenager's name and address, and images or information about his physical appearance. The boy was among four people to be detained in connection with the TalkTalk hacking probe. He was interviewed on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act before being released on bail. Since then, his lawyers have issued writs claiming negligence, misuse of private information, defamation, breach of confidence and data protection. As part of their action, they took legal steps to secure the removal of material published about the boy and where he lived. The court heard that his family has had to move home after the publicity around his arrest. It was claimed that he could be identified from newspaper articles and photographs that appeared at the time. A barrister for the boy said the content contributed to his client being \"stigmatised\" within his community. He said the teenager's name also featured in tweets and online searches. During one of a number of hearings in the case, a lawyer for the Daily Mail rejected claims that it had revealed his identity. She said the newspaper altered the boy's appearance and changed his hair colour in the photo it used. She said his name and address had not been published, and added: \"It's our client's view that they did not identify the plaintiff.\" A temporary ban on reporting on the application for an injunction was imposed over fears that it could trigger further internet searches.

The FAW will have to spend some of the prize money on hotels and transportation, staffing costs and player bonuses, but it will invest the rest in the sport itself. \"It is the job of the FAW to develop, promote and protect Welsh football,\" said Mr Ford. \"And what better way than to see our team play at the highest level in Europe. \"It certainly helps as far as achieving the objectives we set ourselves in our strategic plan and what we are now really able to do is to achieve those objectives more quickly and better than we would have without the team having qualified.\" The tournament is the first time Wales have qualified for a major finals in 58 years and the side have now matched the achievement of the 1958 World Cup team which reached the last eight and lost 1-0 to eventual winners Brazil. When asked if Welsh qualification was the new norm, Mr Ford replied: \"I certainly hope so. We have got to look at this in a consistent way. \"It is not about one qualification, but doing it in a consistent fashion. \"Let's hope that after this - and we do not want this to end any time soon - we can concentrate on World Cup 2018 and see our way to Russia as well.\" In a real \"absolute dream\" scenario Wales would pick up another 8m euros (¡ê6.4m) if they went on to become European champions.

The Big Short's Oscar chances appeared to have dwindled after the film failed to be honoured in the best picture categories at both the Golden Globes and Critics' Choice awards. Yet its unexpected triumph over such Oscar-tipped titles as Spotlight, The Martian and The Revenant has now turned it into an Oscar front-runner. Bookmaker William Hill has seen a huge rush to back The Big Short for Oscar glory and has slashed its odds from 10/1 to 5/4 accordingly. \"We think this is the biggest move in 30-odd years of Oscar betting,\" said a William Hill spokesman. Released in the UK this weekend, The Big Short sees Christian Bale, Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling play brokers who make millions betting that the US housing market will collapse. The film is up for five Oscars in total, among them best director, best supporting actor (Bale) and best adapted screenplay. Collecting the Darryl F Zanuck award for outstanding producer of theatrical motion pictures on Saturday, producer Dede Gardner made reference to the diversity row that has been the talk of Hollywood of late. \"Yes, we have a real problem.

Kim Jong-il is apparently preparing his youngest son as his successor. Succession fears have fuelled tensions on the Korean peninsula.

On Friday, North Korea called for parliamentary talks on how \"to settle the grave situation prevailing between the North and the South.\" This request was rejected by Seoul as it \"lacked sincerity\", the unification ministry said. However, the two Koreas have agreed to bilateral military talks on the fatal attack on Yeongpeong island and the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, widely blamed on a North Korean torpedo attack - although the North strongly denies any role. Seoul has also proposed separate talks on Pyongyang's renewed pledges on its nuclear disarmament. Kim Jong-il's eldest son was interviewed in mid-January by the Tokyo Shimbun. Hereditary succession \"does not fit with socialism, and my father was against it as well,\" he was quoted as saying in the article, which was published on Friday. \"My understanding is that (succession) was to stabilise the internal system. An unstable North Korea leads to instability in the region.\" He said he wanted his youngest half-brother to \"take over the great works my father has done.

It is believed to have been the first playhouse in which Hamlet was performed, in 1596 with Richard Burbage as the lead. Christopher Marlow's Faustus is thought to have first been put on at the theatre in 1592. After a financial dispute, Burbage's sons dismantled the theatre in late December 1598 and moved reusable parts south of the Thames to Bankside for use in construction of their new venture, the Globe. The remains of the Theatre now lie beneath a modern mixed-use building in Hackney. The Hope was the last of the playhouses of the era, opening in approximately 1614 after Philip Henslowe and two partners entered a contract to replace \"the Bear Gardens\" with a new building that would be a joint theatre and bear-baiting arena. The first play performed there was Ben Jonson's Bartholomew Fair but animal baiting and other entertainment gradually eclipsed the plays and the acting company left the Hope in 1617. It was ordered to close down by Parliament in 1643 but continued to operate until it was dismantled in 1656. The remains of the Hope are located beneath a car park on the southern side of Riverside House on Southwark Bridge Road.

General secretary Mick Cash said: \"The company refused to give a guarantee that there will be a second person a€?on their trains despite what they have been telling the press. \"They also failed to clarify what safety competencies and role a second member of staff would have on their services.\" The union sees a second member of staff on board its trains as \"critical\" to passenger safety. In an earlier BBC interview, Mr Mellors said the new trains would \"retain a second person\" on board, but could not say what that person's role would be. A company statement said: \"We know that a second member of staff provides assurance to our passengers on trains and ensures we have capable colleagues on board to deliver assistance during the journey for anyone that needs help or advice while travelling on our trains.\" Disputes over driver-only operated trains on other rail services have led to 16 months of industrial action by the RMT.

{"id": 931, "article": "Tests on animals, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, showed healing times could be cut by nearly a third. Experts said the early results were \"quite impressive\" but needed to be tested on people. More than 200,000 people in the UK have chronic wounds which can take weeks to heal. Ultrasound is already used to heal some bone injuries. A team from the Universities of Sheffield and Bristol tried the technology on mice with chronic wounds, which do not close readily and often become infected. Pressure sores from lying or sitting in the same position for too long, and diabetic foot ulcers which can lead to amputation, are both types of chronic wound. They become more common when we age due to a decline in our body's ability to repair itself. The high frequency sound waves physically vibrate cells in and around the wound. The process effectively wakes up the cells to make them more responsive to the wound. The study showed that in both old and diabetic mice, healing times were reduced from nine to six days. The report said ultrasound was \"restoring healing rates to those observed in young healthy animals\". In the tests the team were treating the wounds before they become chronic, so they will need to test the power of ultrasound on wounds that have been there for weeks. Dr Mark Bass, one of the researchers from Sheffield University, told the BBC News website: \"At the moment, treatment is based around stopping the infection and hoping it heals, with ultrasound we are promoting the healing of the wound.\" \"It's activating the normal healing process, that's why it's an attractive therapy; the ultrasound is simply waking up cells to do what they do normally.\" The researchers now need to study the approach in people, which they expect to do in the next year. \"We're looking at 200,000 patients currently with a chronic wound, all those may well benefit from the technology,\" Dr Bass said. The researchers are using broadly the same equipment that is used in an ultrasound scan during pregnancy. Dr John Connelly, from Queen Mary, University of London, said: \"They're getting almost complete reversal of impaired wound healing which is quite impressive.\" So does it have potential as a treatment? \"I think it could, but that's a major question as wound healing is quite different between humans and mice,\" he said. \"One of the big wound-healing treatments is negative pressure - putting the wound under a vacuum - that acts through mechanical stimulation, so it's entirely reasonable that ultrasound may also work.\"", "question": "A blast of ultrasound can help @placeholder chronic wounds heal more quickly , a study suggests .", "option_0": "major", "option_1": "even", "option_2": "some", "option_3": "more", "option_4": "stubborn"}

Its first service was between Long Eaton, Derbyshire, and the Nottingham Goose Fair in October, 1908. During World War One, workers were transported to and from the nearby National Shell Filling Factory. In 1930, it operated the first diesel-engine passenger-carrying road vehicle. Twenty years later it had a fleet of over 280. Bus deregulation in the 1980s rendered the firm uncompetitive and the transport arm was sold off to rival Trent, which still operates in the East Midlands as Trent Barton. From then Barton's focused on property investment. From its centenary year to 2014, the building in High Road hosted a series of events. But managing director Simon Barton has said the land was now \"ripe for redevelopment\". \"It's a valuable and well-situated brownfield site and when greenbelt is under threat it's better to come to sites like this in order to redevelop those,\" he said. Earlier this month Mr Barton was granted a comprehensive licence for the sale of alcohol and for live music and sports events, despite opposition from some neighbours. The Prince Charles-backed foundation, which has been called the \"creative force\" behind the scheme, said it would try to maintain a balance between heritage and the redevelopment. Senior director Ben Bolgar said: \"It has so much history and character, it's crucial to incorporate these elements into anything new that we build. From the style of the building, to the materials used, even to its name.\" Plans went on public display earlier this month and, if they are approved by Broxtowe Borough Council, work could start before the end of the year.", "question": "The headquarters of what was once the biggest @placeholder bus firm in Western Europe could become a 300 - home development .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "illegal", "option_2": "independent", "option_3": "national", "option_4": "remaining"}

The fund could, however, join in later, provided both the eurozone and Athens take steps to address IMF concerns. The problem for the IMF is that its staff believe the elements so far agreed are not enough to make the Greek government's debt sustainable. Negotiations are under way and the IMF is involved. But its staff think the eurozone governments need to give Greece debt relief. That does not have to be in the form of explicit reductions in the outstanding debt. It could mean longer repayment terms and delays before any payments are required - so-called grace periods. The eurozone has insisted that it is only prepared to look at the possibility after Greece has made a start on implementing whatever conditions will be agreed. The IMF official also said Greece needs to commit itself to further reforms if it is to make the debt situation sustainable. He didn't spell out what they were. But they will involve reforms to the government finances to control spending and maintain tax revenue. They will also cover what are called structural reforms, to remove barriers to economic growth. Faster growth would generate more tax revenue to help make the debt situation sustainable. Neither Greece nor the eurozone are ready to take those steps, the official suggested. The implication then is that Greece and the eurozone will find it very hard to persuade the IMF to stump up any cash at the start, though it might be willing to do so if there is debt relief and further reform later. The immediate significance of the IMF's position is political. If the bailout talks do produce an agreement to provide financial assistance from the eurozone bailout agency, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), it will still need approval by some parliaments, including Germany's Bundestag.

Mr Osborne has faced calls to quit as an MP over his outside interests, which also include a role at a bank. The Standards Committee was set up in 1995 following corruption scandals. It does not have the power to block individual MPs from taking extra jobs - but it could change their code of conduct on outside interests. The Commons standards committee is separately looking at a possible crackdown on MPs working while the Commons is sitting, which could scupper Mr Osborne's latest career move. And a third committee is investigating whether Mr Osborne's new role is a conflict of interest with his former job as chancellor. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (ACOB) - can advise former ministers not to take up new jobs for up to two years if it deems them to be a reward or favour - but it has no formal powers to block appointments. ACOB has cleared Mr Osborne's other new roles, while advising him not to use insider knowledge and contacts gained at the Treasury. Mr Osborne shocked the media and political worlds when he announced he would be working four days a week as editor of the London newspaper - despite a lack of journalistic experience - at the same time as being MP for Tatton, in Cheshire. He has argued that it is important for the Commons to include people with \"different experiences\". He is far from the only MP to have outside interests - more than 100 MPs do other work apart from representing their constituents, from occasional TV appearances and speeches to running a farm or working as a doctor, dentist, company director or lawyer. Standards in Public Life committee chairman Lord Bew said he had been considering reviewing what the Code of Conduct for MPs should say about second jobs for some time. He called on the public to submit their views on the issue - adding that second jobs had to be within \"reasonable limits\". Second jobs are currently deemed \"OK\" by the committee if voters know about them \"at the moment of the election,\" he said. The committee's longstanding position was that it was \"not entirely desirable\" to have a class of professional politicians with no experience of other occupations, said the peer. But he added: \"It is clear that the public's attitude has shifted on this matter and is more negative about it, although I can tell you from the letters we receive that the public is still divided on this issue.\"", "question": "Parliament 's @placeholder watchdog is to review its guidance on MPs ' second jobs in the wake of George Osborne 's appointment as the editor of the London Evening Standard .", "option_0": "decision", "option_1": "ethics", "option_2": "first", "option_3": "governing", "option_4": "media"}

It made walking, sitting and even sleeping difficult. \"Day to day living was a struggle for her,\" said Sophie's mother, Jane Donaldson. But earlier this month Sophie had pioneering surgery at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. The procedure is called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy, and involves cutting nerve roots in Sophie's spine to relieve the stiffness in her muscles. Alder Hey is one of only five hospitals in the country where the operation is carried out. Speaking before the operation, Sophie's father, John, said: \"It's to give her a bit more confidence in herself, a wee bit more freedom.\" During the surgery Sophie's body was wired up to numerous monitors. This allowed the doctors to see how her body reacts when they stimulate the nerve roots in her spine. Neurosurgeon Benedetta Pettorini can then decide which nerve roots to cut, and which to leave alone. \"After three or six months the parents come to me and say 'It's a different child', and they can't even say why, it's just better,\" she said. The first thing Sophie said to her parents when she came round after the operation was: \"Mummy, Daddy, look at my legs - they're not tight.\" Her mother told the BBC: \"That was an early Christmas present. It was fantastic to hear that.\" It is a long and complicated operation, but it is not a miracle cure. Sophie will always need a frame to help her walk, but it should improve her quality of life and make walking and other movement much easier.

They said that southern New England must batten down for an unusual weather event - a great white whale of a storm. Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo told all drivers to get off the roads by 11 pm. After midnight they'd be subject to arrest. States of emergency were called throughout coastal New England. Amtrak north of New York gave up the fight early in the evening and stopped its train service. Has Winter Storm Juno been big and bad enough to justify that build-up? In New York City, definitely not.  Out here in south-eastern New England ... well, you decide. By 9:30pm, we had snow big-time. By 11pm, blasts of white fury hammered at my windows. Outside the winds whipped the rapidly accumulating inches into tall drifts forcing the few walkers - people with dogs - to negotiate a scape of peaks and valleys.  Vehicular traffic had vanished. In central Providence the electricity held - hence we had cable TV to keep us somewhat distracted. Through the night, however, winds would periodically bang at the windows to remind those snuggling indoors that Juno was still on a rampage. By 7am on Tuesday, there was daylight of sorts. Thousands of Rhode Islanders were without electricity, as was the entire island of Nantucket And the snow kept coming - sideways. The local newsman says parts of Rhode Island already have over 20ins (50cm). Worcester, Massachusetts, just north of Providence, is apparently in the absolute bullseye.

The wind continues to let out periodic howls. Despite visitations by the occasional plough, no pavement can be seen on the roads. Meanwhile, the coastal communities are getting nervous about the afternoon high tide, expected around 1pm. Some low-lying areas have already seen storm surges. It's approaching noon, and still nobody's out. Nobody. My aunt in Florida just called to remind me that I haven't visited for a while. That kind of thing is going on a lot.

Wilson, 42, was accused by Scotland Yard of flying the aircraft unmanned and \"failing to maintain direct visual contact\". The charges he admitted included flying the drone on: The court heard police horses were startled by Wilson's device as it flew over a Champions League group stage game between Liverpool and Bulgarian visitors Ludogorets at Anfield. He was also twice arrested in London and had his drones confiscated. District Judge Quentin Purdy told Wilson, a security guard, he had put the public at risk by flying the drones over busy, built-up areas. He said: \"At each and every one of these places an accident could have occurred simply by a gust of wind or something of that nature taking it out of your control. \"In each and every case you knew what you were doing. Several times you were warned by police, who seized drones from you, and on numerous occasions by people posting on your YouTube channel. \"It was the height of arrogance in terms of public safety.\" Wilson, a father-of-two, shot the videos using three unmanned aircraft and uploaded them to his YouTube channel, PV2+ Adventures.

The pair will apparently appear in scenes set at a fictional gala being held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. One scene in the film features a jewel robbery at New York's annual Met Gala - an event packed with celebrities. The news comes three months after Kardashian was held at gunpoint during a robbery in Paris. She took a break from social media and public appearances as a result but has recently returned to Twitter and visited Dubai last week. Rihanna, Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett and Anne Hathaway are due to take some of the main roles in Ocean's Eight. Vogue editor Anna Wintour and fashion designer Zac Posen have also recently been spotted near the set - could they be making cameos in the same scenes?

Mr Davidson died of two stab wounds to the chest that penetrated his heart, and his mother found his body in his living room in Bangor later that day. As well as the prison sentence, the judge said Bustard will spend four years on licence after his release. Bustard, originally from Bangor but whose address was given as Bush Park in Antrim, and his girlfriend Meabh Farrell were arrested in a pub in Bangor the day after the stabbing, Downpatrick Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, had previously heard. He told police he had acted in self-defence after Mr Davidson had attacked him. During interviews with police Bustard said he had been with the victim for 36 hours in the lead-up to the stabbing. He claimed he was punched and struck on the head with a dumbbell by Mr Davidson when they were in the victim's house. He said he then \"jabbed\" Mr Davidson once in the ribs with a knife, but that claim was \"in direct contrast to the results of the post mortem,\" prosecutors said. A defence barrister said he had been \"specifically instructed\" by Mr Bustard to make a \"complete and unqualified apology\" Mr Davidson's family and friends. But he added that the fatal stabbing \"occurred in the throes of an attack\" on Bustard, and that he was under the influence of drugs at the time of the stabbing. The judge said Mr Davidson's death had a \"horrendous\" impact on the victim's mother and that her life \"has been turned upside down\". Bustard's mother Olwyn Bustard and his friend James Owen Gawn were also implicated in the incident and were given suspended sentences for their roles. Ms Bustard, 63, of Rugby Avenue in Bangor was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years after she admitted assisting an offender.

{"id": 990, "article": "Redrow chairman Steve Morgan said the \"crazy\" introduction of sprinklers next year and social housing demands mean it is not viable to build in some areas. The Welsh government said planning has been streamlined and councils are responsible for affordable housing. More than 6,100 homes were completed in Wales last year, according to figures. This was up on the previous year. The increase was fuelled partly by the Welsh government's Help to Buy scheme but Mr Morgan believes this will reduce. He also said local authorities insist on 30% of developments having social housing. And he claimed the introduction of sprinklers in new homes from January will make every property around ?¡ê4,000 more expensive. \"There are whole swathes of Wales - north Wales and south Wales - where we can no longer get a return,\" he told BBC Wales. Ministers have said Help to Buy will be extended but have not said when or for how long. They also revealed figures which showed they had achieved 91% of their target to provide 10,000 additional affordable homes this Assembly term, with over a year to go. A total of 2,218 affordable homes were built in Wales in 2014/15, bringing the total number provided since 2011 to 9,108. Minister for Communities Lesley Griffiths said: \"Boosting housing supply not only creates much-needed homes, but also provides jobs and training opportunities in the construction industry\". House builders criticise the planning process as being too lengthy and too slow and, they say, it costs a lot more to build in Wales compared to England because of extra red tape. And houses sell for less in Wales than most parts of England so all this eats into profits. Nevertheless, there has been signs of a turn around recently. Last year, the number of house building increased by a third to almost 5,000. But Steve Morgan says we can expect that to drop soon, not least because of the extra cost of fitting sprinklers to all new properties. The Welsh government says there are already planning measures coming into place with a new planning law that will allow a consistent approach across the councils. They also say that 30% affordable housing is not a requirement from them as it's up to local councils to, ultimately, make that decision and that they do encourage them to be flexible.", "question": "Fewer homes will soon be built in Wales because of increasing red tape and @placeholder , according to the boss of one of the biggest companies in Wales .", "option_0": "issues", "option_1": "theft", "option_2": "regulation", "option_3": "losses", "option_4": "conditions"}

The wettest January on record and continuing rain in early February could have major financial consequences as insurers are obliged to fund a substantial repair operation. Severe flooding in the UK is not unusual. In 2007 there was extensive damage in several urban areas including Hull and Tewkesbury. The insurance bill for this year's flooding could well end up a lot lower than the payouts required seven years ago. Between May and July 2007, England and Wales experienced the wettest conditions in 200 years. Nearly 50,000 households were affected. So far, about 5,000 homes are believed to have been affected in the current floods, although that figure is likely to rise of course. According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI) there were payouts of ¡ê3bn as a result of the summer floods in 2007. Across the whole of 2012, flooding caused damage worth ¡ê4bn. The ABI believes storms at the end of December and over the New Year have generated bills of ¡ê426m. According to the insurer Hiscox, the latest floods could, if they continue for a couple more weeks, result in payouts of about ¡ê1bn. This would still be well short of the claims seven years ago. Insurance experts at the consultancy firm Deloitte concur with that figure. But they warn that consumers will probably have to pay higher premiums as a result of the latest flooding. Experts say the final bills will depend on how long the wet weather lasts, and how many more households and businesses suffer damage to their properties. In terms of disruption to the economy, it is too early to say. Retailers may lose business if rail links are disrupted for some time.

Open IV's Russian developers said they did not have time or energy to go to court so have stopped distributing it. Gamers have filled GTA forums with criticism of Take-Two for shutting down the long-running mod toolkit. One player said he hoped the legal claim was a joke, another said it was a \"sad day\" for GTA fans and a third said Take-Two had removed a \"massive selling point\" for the PC version of GTA. \"Almost ten years of my life were dedicated to @OpenIV and now this time is over,\" tweeted Open IV lead developer Good-NTS after deciding to shut down the project. In a message posted to the GTA Forums website, Good-NTS said the team had received a \"cease and desist\" letter on 5 June alleging that it allowed \"third parties to defeat security features of its software and modify that software in violation Take-Two's rights\". He wrote that fighting the claim in court would take months of time and effort and, even if they won, would not help the company more forward. \"Spending time just to restore status quo is really unproductive, and all the money in the world can't compensate the loss of time,\" he said. As a result, Open IV would no longer be available for download. Anyone using the kit is now greeted with a message explaining what has happened when they start up a modified version of GTA.

Doctors hope to harness this power to make a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any type of influenza. Ultimately this could replace the \"best guess\" flu vaccines currently used. Such a vaccine is the \"holy grail\" for flu researchers. Many scientists are already testing different prototypes to put an end to the yearly race to predict coming flu strains and quickly mass produce a new vaccine each flu season. Dr Patrick Wilson who led the latest research said the H1N1 swine flu virus that reached pandemic levels infecting an estimated 60 million people last year, had provided a unique opportunity for researchers. \"It demonstrates how to make a single vaccine that could potentially provide immunity to all influenza. \"The surprise was that such a very different influenza strain, as opposed to the most common strains, could lead us to something so widely applicable.\" In the nine patients they studied who had caught swine flu during the pandemic, they found the infection had triggered the production of a wide range of antibodies that are only very rarely seen after seasonal flu infections or flu vaccination. Five antibodies isolated by the team could fight all the seasonal H1N1 flu strains from the last decade, the devastating \"Spanish flu\" strain from 1918 which killed up to 50m people, plus a potentially deadly bird flu H5N1 strain. The researchers believe the \"extraordinarily\" powerful antibodies were created as the body learned how to fight the new infection with swine flu using its old memory of how to fight off other flu viruses. Next they plan to examine the immune response of people who were vaccinated against last year's swine flu but did not get sick to see if they too have the same super immunity to flu. Dr Sarah Gilbert is a expert in viruses at Oxford University and has been testing her own prototype universal flu vaccine. She said: \"Many scientists are working to develop a vaccine that would protect against the many strains of flu virus. \"This work gives us more confidence that it will be possible to generate a universal flu vaccine.\" But she said it would take many years for a product to go through the necessary tests and trials. \"It will take at least five years before anything like this could be widely available.\" The number of deaths this winter from flu verified by the Health Protection Agency currently is 50, with 45 of these due to swine flu.", "question": "People who recover from swine flu may be left with an extraordinary @placeholder ability to fight off flu viruses , findings suggests .", "option_0": "human", "option_1": "outstanding", "option_2": "expected", "option_3": "lavish", "option_4": "natural"}

The effect was small and individuals should not be alarmed, but there was a notable impact on the population as a whole, the researchers said. Low birth weight babies have a higher risk of health problems and death. The majority survive but have an increased risk of developing conditions such as diabetes and heart disease as adults. The International Collaboration on Air Pollution and Pregnancy Outcomes (ICAPPO), by Prof Tracey Woodruff and colleagues at the University California, San Francisco, focused on airborne particulate matter small enough to penetrate the human respiratory tract. The findings indicated the relationship between birth weight and pollution was dose related - the higher the exposure, the lower the average birth weight. Prof Woodruff said: \"What's significant is that these are air pollution levels to which practically everyone in the world is commonly exposed.\" Prof Kevin McConway, a statistician at the Open University said, based on the findings, if Newcastle were to halve its current particulate air pollution level it would lead to two or three fewer low weight babies out of the total 3,500 or so born in the city each year. He said: \"That sort of reduction might well be worth having, but it's not something that pregnant mothers should lose sleep over, I'd say.\" Dr Tony Fletcher, senior lecturer in Environmental Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"The study is of excellent quality and the conclusions are clear.

Should Becchetti not pay the tax bill before the court date, then at the winding-up hearing the fans would seek the appointment of an administrator, despite the fact it would mean the club being deducted 12 points under English Football League rules. An administrator would then look to sell the club as a going concern to a potential new owner. \"That application would be made as late as possible to give the club's current owner time to settle the bill,\" said Loft spokesman Tom Davies. However, he added that should an adjournment of the court hearing provide a more stable course and future for the club, then they would favour an adjournment. In addition, Loft has launched a crowd funding page to try to raise ¡ê250,000 - reportedly the tax sum owed by the club.

Whistleblowers told BBC Scotland last week that surgical staff had been bullied and \"physically prevented\" from seeing patients in the emergency department. The matter was discussed in Holyrood after staff claimed surgeons were not allowed to assess patients until they had been moved to the surgical department, so hospital managers could \"tick a box\" saying the patient had been discharged from A&E. One doctor said they had \"never experienced emergency care which is so aggressive in terms of getting patients out of the department\", amid an \"utter fixation to the four hour target\".

The court heard how Jason's friend ran to a neighbour's home, telling him that \"he, [Jason] is cold, he is cold\". On returning to the house, Jason's friend again attempted to give him CPR, but his neighbour, who had guessed \"something terrible had just happened\", believed that the teenager was already dead.

The prosecution read statements from a witness in the Weigh Inn car park in Kelvin Street, Omagh. That is where the teenager was attacked hours earlier following a night out with friends.

{"id": 1028, "article": "Rights activists have criticised the arrests of more than 700 suspected illegal migrants following recent deadly xenophobic violence. Police say they made the arrests during crime prevention operations. The authorities have been under pressure to both bring an end to the attacks on foreigners and to introduce tighter immigration controls. The African migrants detained at the Lindela repatriation centre, 25km (15 miles) west of Johannesburg, were due to be deported on Wednesday, reports the BBC's Nomsa Maseko. They had been arrested over the past few weeks during night time raids in and around Johannesburg. But their deportation has been halted for at least two weeks after the organisation Lawyers for Human Rights went to the Johannesburg High Court to prevent it from taking place. Latest African news updates The lawyers have also been given permission to consult with their clients after being barred from doing so by the government. This will give the lawyers time to get a list of names of those who have been arrested, and check if they are in the country as asylum seekers. The raids come after a wave of xenophobic attacks in April which affected major cities in South Africa. At least seven people were killed, 5,000 left homeless and many foreign-owned shops were looted in the attacks. Campaign group Right to Know called the mass arrests of suspected illegal migrants \"state-funded xenophobia\". \"The raids were a heavy-handed response that have seen families being separated,\" the group's spokesman Murray Hunter told the AFP news agency. Steve Faulkner, from the Coalition of Movements Against Xenophobia, described a recent raid on Johannesburg's Central Methodist Church, where many refugees seek shelter, as a \"military operation in the middle of the night... People were herded together and taken to the police station\", AFP reports.

{"id": 1031, "article": "Not only was she taking on the controversial immigration brief, she was also about to become Italy's first black minister. But perhaps even Ms Kyenge has been surprised by the ferocity of the backlash. She has been repeatedly subjected to racist slurs of the crudest kind. The latest came over the weekend from a vice-president of Italy's Senate, Roberto Calderoli, a prominent member of the anti-immigration Northern League party. Addressing its supporters he said; \"I love animalsa€| but when I see pictures of Kyenge I cannot but think of - even if I'm not saying she is one - the features of an orangutan.\" He went on to say that Ms Kyenge was attracting illegal immigrants to Italy, and that she should be a minister in her \"own country\". This is fairly typical of the kind of abuse that has been directed at the minister by Northern League activists. One accused her of wanting to impose \"tribal traditions\" on Italy. And another actually went so far as to call for Ms Kyenge to be raped so that she would understand what someone who might be raped by an immigrant might go through. Ms Kyenge, the one prominent black figure in parliament, seems to have become the focus of a very large amount of the openly racist sentiment in the Italian political arena. So far she has coped with considerable dignity. Amid the furore over his \"orangutan\" remark, Mr Calderoli was forced to apologise. Ms Kyenge accepted this but said that if Mr Calderoli could not translate his views into proper political discourse he should perhaps step aside as the Senate's vice-president. In the background to all this lies some quite profound social change. Italy is now having to absorb larger numbers of immigrants. Back in 2000 there were only about one million of them here. Today there are about five million - about 8% of the population. And right now, with so many Italian families of all backgrounds finding it difficult to cope economically, perhaps tensions are inevitable. As Ms Kyenge herself put it: \"Some people are struggling to accept that the country has changed.\" Professor James Walston of the American University in Rome, who analyses Italian attitudes towards race, wrote recently in his blog: \"To these people a woman like Cecile Kyenge would be acceptable if she was a docile house servant on the lines of the 30s Hollywood stereotype. \"The fact that she is a successful eye surgeon and now a self-assured cabinet minister is threatening for them.\" The Northern League has set itself against what it calls an \"uncontrollable influx of immigrants\". This is an important part of its electoral platform. And a long-time observer of the party, Professor Roberto Biorcio, of Milan's Bicocca University, sees Mr Calderoli's remarks as part of a calculated effort to focus more on this emotive area. \"I'm under the impression that Calderoli and certain sectors of the league want to draw attention back to the issue of immigration,\" he said. \"As usual, they do it in the most provocative manner - but it has helped them in the past.\" Away from the party political fray, casual racism surfaces in many areas of Italian life. Among the gaffes of Silvio Berlusconi during his time as prime minister was a reference to US President Barack Obama as being \"sun tanned\". He dismissed anyone who did not think that this was funny as a \"humourless imbecile\". And racism has repeatedly manifested itself in Italian football. Earlier this year the whole of the AC Milan team walked off the pitch in support of one of their black colleagues who was being subjected to abusive chanting from the stands. But far from the headlines, in the course of everyday life, immigrants talk of being surrounded by racism. \"You hear comments on the bus, in the markets, in schools,\" said Pape Diaw, a leader of the Senegalese community in Florence. \"To think that the Italian people are racist is wrong. But there is... a type of racist mentality. \" He said that politicians were reluctant to tackle the issue, and that with tensions building there was a risk of a social explosion.", "question": "When Cecile Kyenge @placeholder to become a minister in Italy 's latest government she was well aware that she would have to break new and difficult ground .", "option_0": "agreed", "option_1": "chose", "option_2": "wanted", "option_3": "promised", "option_4": "tends"}

An earlier show's presenter choked back tears after learning of the news. The cancellations came as parliament approved the closure of the state-run Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA). It will be replaced with a new, smaller entity known as Kan on Monday. The IBA was established in 1948 and held a monopoly on TV and radio broadcasts in the country until the 1990s. Like the BBC, it was funded mainly by licence fees. In 2014, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government announced that the IBA would be replaced with a new public broadcaster that would be less costly. Opponents expressed concern that Mr Netanyahu, who has accused IBA journalists of being overly critical of his right-wing coalition, wanted to control the media. The setting up of Kan was delayed repeatedly and almost abandoned in March. Mr Netanyahu reportedly wanted it scrapped because he was concerned that two officials appointed to senior positions in the new broadcaster were left-leaning.

The tests began on the same day as Nato and some of its partners started an Arctic training exercise. Russia's actions in Ukraine and incursions into Western airspace have led to rising tensions with the West. According to reports on the Russian agencies Interfax and Tass, the inspection of the aviation group and air defence forces in the central military district involves almost 700 weapons and pieces of military hardware. During the exercise, Russia's long-range aircraft are due to carry out cruise missile strikes on practice targets in the Komi republic. The BBC's Caroline Wyatt, in Moscow, says the current drills are in preparation for a larger exercise known as Center-2015 in the next few months. Asked about Russia's assertiveness in a TV interview, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin joked that \"tanks don't need visas\". The outspoken politician is himself on EU and US blacklists as part of sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea last year, limiting his travel options.

The party said the ink attack on Sudheendra Kulkarni was a form of \"peaceful protest\" against Pakistan. Mr Kulkarni called the incident \"an attack on democracy\".

Last month, a judge ruled that the secrecy surrounding the source of the state's lethal injection drugs was unconstitutional. The court decision came as US states are having increasing trouble obtaining drugs used in executions, amid an embargo from European pharmaceutical firms. Critics say the states risk botching executions and causing unnecessary suffering with impure drugs. In January, an execution in Ohio took 25 minutes to complete, as the inmate reportedly gasped and made choking noises in the moments before he was pronounced dead. The state used two untried drugs to kill convicted murderer and rapist Dennis McGuire after the maker of the previous execution drug refused to allow its use. Oklahoma state law blocks officials from revealing - even during court proceedings - the identities of the companies supplying the drugs used to sedate the inmates, paralyse their respiratory systems, and stop their hearts. The challenge to Oklahoma's law was brought by Lockett, who received the death penalty for the 1999 shooting of a 19-year-old woman, and Warner, who was convicted for the 1997 murder and rape of an 11-month-old girl. Oklahoma County district court Judge Patricia Parrish struck down the secrecy law on 26 March, saying the protocol that prevented the inmates from seeking information about the drugs used violated their rights. The state said on 1 April that the men would be executed using midazolam, pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride - a combination never before used in Oklahoma, according to the Associated Press.

Even the finance minister Jane Hutt couldn't resist having a swipe at the hundreds of millions of pounds in their coffers, before telling Good Morning Wales why she is rolling back on the proposed cutbacks because of concerns over part-time teaching and scientific research. Ministers stressed it was a draft budget and, like all drafts, it was open to consultation before changes were made. Be that as it may, there is clearly strong feeling within government that not only can universities afford it, but that their time has come to take a hit after further education colleges took one last year. Universities insist the reserves are needed for investment to continue and for the sector in Wales to remain internationally competitive. The stand-off between ministers and vice-chancellors was beginning to develop. Opposition parties were frustrated that while many of the higher education bosses were lobbying them heavily, they weren't doing so publicly, with the exception of Professor Colin Riordan, the vice-chancellor of Cardiff university. But nevertheless it was clear that universities weren't happy, and it was adding to the simmering resentment that had already developed over the government's university tuition fee policy. In fact, the general cut and the tuition fees policy became enmeshed because the Welsh government had argued that much of the cash reduction was in fact staying in the system because the money was being re-directed to fee subsidies, rather than going directly to the institutions. The comeback from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales was that only around 60% of the tuition fee grants will stay in Wales as the fees follow the students, wherever they choose to go. In the end, a political decision was taken not to get involved in a scrap with vice-chancellors. As we head into an election campaign, there's an argument to say it would have been a huge distraction but also a potential opportunity for the Welsh government to show it wasn't afraid to make unpopular decisions.

The glass roof of the conference centre was dark with snow. But since then, a remarkable set of changes has allowed the Paris Agreement to take shape. Paris climate deal enters force as focus shifts to action UN review says carbon plans fall well short of climate goals For a start, the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and US, jointly decided to make a serious push. For President Obama, this has always been a priority. And for China the new middle class is demanding an end to the toxic pollution smothering the biggest cities. And that's spurred another shift: renewable energy is falling in price. Out in the deserts of western China, along the ancient Silk Road, I've seen for myself new forests of wind turbines. Recently, China has planted two of them every hour. The Chinese push for renewable energy is the largest the world has ever seen. And look at the global figure for solar panels installed last year - it was half a million every day. A third big change is the involvement of leading companies. A decade ago, it was rare for me to get a corporate press release making a green boast. Now my inbox is bursting with them. On Friday, 10 oil companies announced a one-billion-dollar fund for low-carbon technology - something inconceivable not long ago but, let's be clear, the sum is dwarfed by the money spent developing new sources of oil. So will the Paris Agreement get anywhere? On the one hand, it doesn't oblige any government to cut their greenhouse gases. But, on the other, each country's efforts will be scrutinised every five years. And although the agreement has no teeth, it does represent something unique: the first time that every nation on the planet has signed up to try to head off the worst effects of global warming.", "question": "Only seven years ago , the very idea that an international climate agreement would come into force today looked @placeholder .", "option_0": "hopeless", "option_1": "up", "option_2": "promising", "option_3": "ridiculous", "option_4": "real"}

She had sent it to people who had donated money for a project to make a vagina-shaped kayak using a 3D printer. The arrest made headlines in national media and triggered discussion on Japan's obscenity laws. Ms Igarashi also goes by the moniker Rokudenashiko, which means \"no-good girl\" in Japanese. A police spokesman told AFP news agency she had distributed data that could \"create an obscene shape\". On her website, Ms Igarashi says she has made several pieces of art based on her genitals using a silicone mould, saying she wants to make vaginas \"more casual and pop\". The vagina \"has been such a taboo in Japanese society... (it) has been thought to be obscene\", while penises are regarded as \"part of pop culture\", she said. Rokudenashiko, or Megumi Igarashi, was not a household name in Japan but her arrest has certainly made her one. Major media outlets reported on her arrest and social media platforms like Twitter have since been flooded with comments. Opinion is split but one debate is about whether the scanned 3D data can be categorised as obscene unless the recipients have printed it out. Others have questioned why the image of a vagina is seen as obscene when images of penises are not seen as causing offence. There are, for example, annual festivals in Japan where a huge wooden phallus is carried from a shrine or visitors can enjoy sweets shaped like penises. Local media are also being criticised for labelling Ms Igarashi a \"self-proclaimed\" artist, with some suggesting that police and the media are trying to discredit her. People on Twitter are contrasting their coverage with Western media, which has treated her as an artist. According to Japan's Asahi newspaper, Ms Igarashi told police she rejected the charges. \"I cannot agree with the police's decision to label the data as obscene,\" she reportedly said. \"To me, my vagina is like my arms and legs. It's nothing obscene.\" Japan's obscenity laws ban the depiction of genitalia, which are blurred in broadcast media and images. Ms Igarashi's arrest comes a month after legislators voted to ban the possession of child pornography.

{"id": 1066, "article": "Using pictures from the Cassini probe, the researchers have detected and tracked a slight wobble in the moon. After seven years of study, they have concluded this flutter would be much less if the icy crust was connected directly to Enceladus's rock core. It is strong support for the idea of an intervening, global mass of liquid. \"If the surface and core were rigidly connected, the core would provide so much dead weight that the wobble would be far smaller than we observe it to be,\" said Matthew Tiscareno, a Cassini scientist based at the Seti Institute but previously affiliated to Cornell University, US. \"This proves that there must be a global layer of liquid separating the surface from the core.\" Activity on Enceladus has been one of the great discoveries on the Cassini mission, which arrived at Saturn in 2004. The first clue that something interesting was going on was some low-resolution images showing a plume coming off the south pole that had the space-interested internet all abuzz. Shortly after, Cassini detected a disturbance in magnetic fields produced by the presence of what appeared to be an atmosphere. Scientists then established that the moon was actually venting huge jets of water vapour through south polar surface cracks dubbed tiger stripes because of their resemblance to the big cat's fur coat. Models were subsequently produced to explain how liquid water could be maintained on a 500km-wide body in the outer Solar System, and how that water might be feeding the jets. But there has always been a debate about how large the hidden reservoir might be. Early thinking suggested it might only be a relatively small lens of water. This new result, published in the journal Icarus, is the best evidence yet that the sub-surface sea is not regional in nature, but encircles the entire globe. It is significant because it makes it more possible that Enceladus is a habitable world.  In those jets, Cassini has also detected salts and organic molecules.  The chemistry has scientists intrigued, and fired up to send a dedicated mission to the moon. When that might happen is unclear.  Both the US and European space agencies are only planning currently to send probes to Jupiter, and even they are not likely to get to their destination until the 2030s. Cassini itself is winding up its observations in the Saturn system.  It has another couple of close passes of Enceladus this year before it then starts to manoeuvre towards disposal in the ringed planet's atmosphere in 2017.

Poland-born Krzysztof Charamsa said he wanted to challenge the Church's \"backward\" attitude to homosexuality. He was later dismissed from his post at the Vatican's office in charge of guarding Roman Catholic doctrine. A Vatican spokesman said Monsignor Charamsa's decision to give interviews on the eve of the synod was \"grave and irresponsible\" and would put Pope Francis under \"undue media pressure\". In an interview with the Corriere Della Sera newspaper, the 43-year-old priest said: \"It's time the Church opened its eyes and realised that offering gay believers total abstinence from a life of love is inhuman.\" The controversy has set the scene for what some fear could be a fractious three weeks, says BBC religious affairs correspondent Caroline Wyatt. The Synod - a defining moment for Pope Francis Almost 300 Church leaders - and some lay people - will be discussing such issues as the treatment of Catholics who are gay, and how to approach couples who live together without being married or wish to take communion after being divorced. Analysis: Caroline Wyatt, BBC News It is the most highly-anticipated meeting of the leaders of the Roman Catholic church since the Second Vatican council, some 50 years ago. In his homily today, the Pope spoke of the importance of the family - and perhaps rather pointedly, of the love between a man and a woman. He also said that the wealth of the developed world hadn't led to greater happiness, but to loneliness, and higher rates of abortion and divorce. Many campaigners and more liberal Catholics would like to see a change in Catholic doctrine on issues ranging from homosexuality to contraception. But while some bishops here do want reform, others remain fiercely opposed. In the end, though, the synod is not a democracy. It will be up to the Pope to decide what - if anything - changes, and how the Church applies its teaching to its sometimes errant flock. The Pope has called for a more understanding attitude on sexual issues. After his election in 2013, Pope Francis reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but said homosexual orientation was not. \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\" he said. The issue of homosexuality was also highlighted during the Pope's visit to the US last week. He had a private meeting with a gay former student of his and his boyfriend at the Vatican mission in Washington. The Pope also met Kim Davis, a Kentucky local official who recently gained attention for refusing to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples.", "question": "Pope Francis has celebrated Mass at St Peter 's Basilica in the Vatican , at the start of a synod of Roman Catholic bishops @placeholder on family issues .", "option_0": "focusing", "option_1": "meeting", "option_2": "based", "option_3": "major", "option_4": "working"}

Defending the deal in an interview on state television, he said: \"I assume responsibility for all mistakes I may have made, I assume responsibility for a text I do not believe in, but which I signed to avoid disaster for the country, the collapse of the banks.\" He said he had battled not to cut wages and pensions, arguing the terms agreed were milder than those in previous deals.

Meanwhile Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers from euro countries - a key figure in the weekend's fraught negotiations - said he was \"angry\" at Mr Tsipras for urging Greek votes to reject a similar package of austerity measures in a referendum. \"You can't promise things that you can't bring about,\" he told Dutch television. Mr Tsipras said the referendum had helped secure a better, more long-term deal. His interview comes on the eve of the vote in Greece's parliament. The measures, including pensions and VAT reforms, must be passed by Wednesday. A number of Syriza MPs are likely to rebel and the junior coalition party, the Independent Greeks, have offered only limited support.

The diversion on to the A10 bypass increased the race - already the longest of the Spring Classics - from 291km to 300km. The race was dogged by a number of crashes involving high-profile riders, including Team Sky's Thomas, who was among the favourites after victory in the week-long Paris-Nice stage race earlier this month. The Welshman was near the front of the peloton in the foothills of the Cipressa climb with 30km to the finish when a compression caused several riders to crash, including Thomas and team-mate Peter Kennaugh. Both riders picked themselves up but struggled to get back into contention, while the 2009 winner, Manxman Cavendish, saw his challenge fall away on the Cipressa's punishing ascent. Former British road champion Ian Stannard of Team Sky and Movistar's Giovanni Visconti took advantage of further crashes on the narrow coastal roads to open up a 20-second gap on the descent, but were then reeled back on the gruelling Poggio di Sanremo.

{"id": 1101, "article": "Lord Myners' review is highly critical of the group's takeovers of Britannia building society and supermarket chain, Somerfield. He added it would be \"inappropriate and premature\" to appoint a new boss of the Group now. Co-op chief executive Euan Sutherland resigned on Tuesday. Mr Sutherland's resignation came after it was revealed he had described the Group as \"ungovernable\" in a recent Facebook post. Read more from Robert Earlier this month details of his basic salary of ¡ê1.5m, including a retention bonus for another ¡ê1.5m, were revealed. With pension contributions and other extras, Mr Sutherland would have received ¡ê3.66m this year. The first stage of the Myners review accuses the Co-op of suffering from a significant \"democratic deficit\" in which ordinary members have surprisingly weak constitutional rights and a limited ability to influence the group's social mission and activities. The Britannia building society and Somerfield takeovers had cost the Group billions of pounds and had led to the accumulation of unsustainable debts which undermined its competitive position and severely eroded its capital base, Lord Myners added. The former Labour City minister was appointed as a senior independent director by Co-op Group chair Ursula Lidbetter in December, to undertake a full review of the entire business. It followed the collapse last year of Co-op Bank's deal to take over 632 Lloyds Bank branches and the arrest of the bank's chairman Reverend Paul Flowers on drugs allegations. He was suspended from both the Methodist church and the Labour party and later resigned from the Co-op. Co-op Group chairman Len Wardle, who appointed Reverend Flowers, was also forced out. Lord Myners' initial report found the Group's three-tier system of elected member representation had \"consistently produced governors without the necessary qualifications and experience to provide effective board leadership\". He added this had \"massively raised the cost of decision-making and diminished genuine accountability throughout its governance hierarchy\". And he said that while \"one member, one vote\" had been a core principle of co-operative ownership, at present ordinary members do not have the right to attend Annual General Meetings or to elect or re-elect Group board directors. The Co-op Group is cutting staff and selling off parts of its business in an effort to save itself but is still expected to post annual losses in excess of ¡ê2bn at the end of this month. Lord Myners' review will recommend that Group board directors should be subject to annual election or re-election by all members and that vacancies should be openly advertised and candidates appointed on merit against clear criteria of skills and experience. They will also include the creation of a new Group board made up of an independent chair with no previous association or involvement with the Group, six to seven independent non-executive directors, and two executive directors. Lord Myners said the new, far smaller board would replace the existing 20-strong elected board of directors. He pointed out he had no power to decide whether his recommendations would be approved. Lord Myners said the decision to accept the recommendations would most likely \"lie in the hands of fewer than 50 elected members\" who if they acted together would be able to cast more than one-third of the Group's votes in opposition to them. He added: \"Until the outcome of these constitutional changes is decided, it is my opinion that it would be inappropriate and premature to proceed with the appointment of a new CEO, in view of the risk that, while these governance issues remain unresolved, \"The Co-operative Group will be unable to attract applications from best-in-class retail executives. Confirmation of members? readiness to approve radical governance reform will also be essential to reduce current uncertainty among existing key employees.\" In December of last year the ownership structure of the Co-operative Bank was changed and it is now only 30% owned by the Co-operative Group.

On Monday, Smith & Wesson raised its sales estimate, saying the market was \"stronger than originally anticipated\". The number of background checks on potential buyers - a guide to future sales - has also risen. The National Instant Criminal Background Check System said that checks were up by about 38% last month compared with December 2014. Smith & Wesson's trading update said that for the three months ending 31 January it expected sales to be about $175m-$180m. Earlier guidance put the likely figure at between $150m and $155m. The company said that \"the sell-through rate of its products at distribution has been stronger than originally anticipated, resulting in reduced distributor inventories of its firearms\". That means guns are being bought faster than Smith & Wesson is supplying them. The firm said its net profit was $14.2m (?¡ê9.46m) for the period, compared with $5.2m for the same period last year. In December, the company reported that profits had nearly tripled for the three months to October and net sales have increased 38% over the last five years. On Monday, the White House unveiled proposals for gun control measures that require more sellers to get licences and more gun buyers to undergo background checks. The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will require that people who sell guns at stores, at gun shows or over the internet be licensed and conduct checks, The bureau is also finalising a rule requiring background checks for buyers of dangerous weapons from a trust, corporation or other legal entity. President Obama is due to disclose further details about the plans on Tuesday. The president has said he will curb gun violence and unregulated sales after a series of mass shootings, which included last month's attack in San Bernardino, California, that killed 14 people.

They were unearthed by Spanish-based Access Info and Belgian magazine Knack. The Commission said the spending was within the EU's rules. It was also scrutinized annually by the European Parliament, a spokeswoman added. On Mr Juncker's trip from Brussels to Italy, he held meetings with then-Italian PM Matteo Renzi, the Senate president and the president of the chamber of deputies, among others. Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the private jet was chartered because there was \"no viable commercial plane available that would fit the president's agenda\" and stressed the 2,927 euro (¡ê2,650) per person cost of the flight. If the European Commission fears the return of the allegation that the EU is a giant gravy train (or a \"gravy plane,\" maybe), then they did not show it. Officials mounted a passionate defence of how much the 28 European commissioners spend on travel. It's their job to promote EU policies abroad! It's all within the rules! And the European Parliament approves the accounts! Jean-Claude Juncker's €25,000 private plane to Rome was shared with eight officials who had no other way of getting there.

Mr Clarkson, a delegate from Leicestershire. suggested that some executive head teachers and heads were now able to look at their budgets and decide how much to pay themselves. The conference voted in favour of the motion that every school should publish its staffing structure and pay ranges of all teaching staff, including senior leadership salaries and those of executive head teachers. \"Let me remind you whose money is being used to do this - ours,\" said Mr Clarkson. \"Let me remind you who this money should be spent on - the children and young people in our care. \"So I call for senior leadership salaries, including the salaries of executive head teachers to be published by schools.\" \"Once, the accountability was provided for by local authorities,\" said Mr Clarkson. \"County council offices up and down the country, elected members and council officers made sure that schools both kept to the rules and served the needs of their local communities.\" Schools and colleges are facing cuts, despite government assurances it has protected budgets, the conference in Liverpool has heard.

Creator John Ferguson believes the new comic \"meets the high standards\" of America's Marvel and DC Comics. First published two years ago, the comics follow Saltire's encounters with Saxons, Romans, Highland clan warriors and also supernatural beings such as vampires and giants. Some of the characters have been inspired by historical events and figures, including the mysterious disappearance of the Roman auxiliary legion the 9th Hispana in Scotland in AD 120 and the Hebrides' Lord of the Isles. Glaswegian Ferguson, who set up Diamondsteel Comics with his Lancashire-born wife Clare, said other elements of Scotland's past and folklore also feature. He said: \"The Stone of Destiny, the Blue Stanes, the Loch Ness Monster and the Caledonian Fae traditions all have a significant place in the Saltire universe. \"Saltire's origin is built from myth and legend so a comparison might be Marvel's Thor although perhaps a bit darker and grittier. He does have an iconic visual appeal similar to the famous American superheroes.\" A year in the making, Saltire: Legend Eternal, the first comic book in a new series of the comics has been \"meticulously inked, coloured and lettered\" to compete with the high standards set by Marvel and DC Comics, said Ferguson.

Presumably now the view from the leadership will be that while everyone will have to make some concessions for the sake of unity, the bulk of compromise and change in attitude will have to be made by those Labour MPs who resigned from his top team. In other words, the message to them will be that the Corbyn camp is sitting pretty at the top of the party and going nowhere. The first big test will be how the shadow cabinet is elected. The internal workings of the Labour party may seem a million miles from the everyday lives of the public but decisions on this set the tone on whether Labour can become a remotely unified opposition or appear to many as a dysfunctional set-up indulging in yet another internal contest. It is probably too much to ask that the differences and bad-feeling will disappear, what may be more realistic is that Jeremy Corbyn manages to get the party focused on the issues that it agrees on, such as opposition to grammar schools in England, and harness those feelings to take on the Conservatives. The truth is that the wings of the party agree on more than they disagree on and somehow Corbyn and his allies have to make that count. And what about the Pontypridd MP Owen Smith? Was his challenge brave or foolhardy? Because of the make-up of the current membership, there is an argument to say that Jeremy Corbyn would have won whoever stood against him. Owen Smith had the challenge of creating a national profile for himself as well as landing blows on his rival. One problem he had was allowing himself to be characterised as a Blairite candidate by Corbyn supporters, particularly in relation to his links with the pharmaceutical industry, and at times there appeared to be a lack of consistency in his approach.

His 2001 retrospective The Very Best Of is at number one, followed by the 2006 collection Ultimate. Purple Rain is at three, followed by The Hits / The B-Sides and 1987's double album Sign O' The Times. Six of Prince's hits are also due to re-enter the singles chart, led by Purple Rain which is currently at number two. The song reached Number eight upon its original release in 1984, meaning the song could hit a new peak on Friday's Official Chart. The rock legend died suddenly last Thursday at the age of 57. Even though last week's chart was compiled mere hours after the news was announced, the Ultimate compilation rocketed to tenth place in the countdown, with 5,389 sales. In the US, The Very Best of Prince and Purple Rain took the number one and two spot respectively in the Billboard chart, outselling the rest of the market in less than 24 hours. Such sales were undoubtedly spurred by Prince's absence from streaming services. The star's catalogue is only available to stream on Tidal, while he relentlessly pursued people who illegally uploaded his material to sites like SoundCloud, Daily Motion and YouTube. \"I have a team of female black lawyers who keep an eye on such transgressions,\" Prince once said. \"And you know they're sharp.\" Prince died at his Paisley Park home near Minneapolis last week, after reports he was suffering with flu. He was found in an unresponsive state in a lift on the first floor of his home. Emergency service personnel performed CPR, but were unable to revive him. The star was pronounced dead at the scene. Details of the post-mortem examination have yet to be released, but his body was released to his family on Friday afternoon and he was cremated on Saturday. Thousands of fans have flocked to Paisley Park, the First Avenue nightclub, and other sites made famous by Prince since his death, while tributes have come from Lady Gaga, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Justin Timberlake and President Obama, amongst others. Eric Clapton said Prince had helped him battle depression and drug addiction in the 1980s, calling him \"a light in the darkness\". \"I was out on the road in a massive downward spiral with drink and drugs,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"I saw Purple Rain in a cinema in Canada, I had no idea who he was, it was like a bolt of lightning! In the middle of my depression, and the dreadful state of the music culture at that time it gave me hope.\" Justin Timberlake added: \"He's somewhere within every song I've ever written.\" Meanwhile, US comedy show Saturday Night Live dedicated this weekend's edition to the star, broadcasting archive performances and footage of an invitation-only concert he gave for the programme's 40th Anniversary. The NFL also uploaded the star's memorable, rain-drenched SuperBowl concert to YouTube for the first time since it aired in 2007. A senator in Prince's home state of Minnesota has called for purple to be adopted as its official colour, reported the St Paul Pioneer Press; while Prince's brother-in-law said plans were \"in the works\" for a large-scale public musical memorial. A private memorial service was held for the rock star on Saturday, attended by about 20 of his closest friends and family. Among them was Sly and the Family Stone bassist Larry Graham, who toured with Prince and converted him to the Jehovah's Witness faith. Also present was drummer Sheila E, one of Prince's most frequent collaborators on records including Lovesexy, Erotic City and The Glamorous Life. Speaking to EW after the service, she said the congregation was still struck by disbelief. \"What was challenging yesterday was listening to his music at a very low, soft volume and the room very low in lights and everyone just taking a moment, just sitting there, kind of going, 'Wow,'\" she said. The musician also confirmed plans to turn Prince's home and recording studio into a museum, akin to Elvis's Graceland. \"We're hoping to make Paisley what [Prince wanted] it to be. [He] was working on it being a museum,\" she said. \"He's been gathering memorabilia and stuff from all the tours, like my drums and his motorcycle.\" \"There's a hallway of his awards and things, which he really didn't care about too much, but he displayed it for the fans because he knows that they would want to see it,\" she continued. The percussionist added that she would be the musical director of the forthcoming tribute, which is expected to take place in Minneapolis. And she said Prince never truly appreciated his impact on fans. \"When you're in a place of musically creating and writing, you just do your thing, and you don't realise how many people you touch,\" she explained. \"I don't know that he really knew how he touched almost everyone in this world.\"", "question": "Pop star Prince is on course to dominate the UK charts this week , as @placeholder fans rush to buy his music .", "option_0": "await", "option_1": "mourning", "option_2": "continues", "option_3": "lost", "option_4": "blaming"}

He left for Cuba early on Tuesday to attend the funeral of Fidel Castro. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories The Guptas and their links to Jacob Zuma Profile: Jacob Zuma Mr Zuma has survived several opposition-sponsored no confidence votes in parliament. This was the first time he faced a rebellion from senior ANC members who serve in his cabinet. Tourism Minister Derek Hanekom tabled a motion calling for his sacking at a meeting of the party's National Executive Committee (NEC). He was backed by several other ministers, including Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi and Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi, local media reported. \"The NEC did not support the call for the president to step down,\" ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe told a news conference. \"This issue was debated openly, robustly and, as we said, sometimes it was very difficult for members themselves,\" he added. Earlier this month, an investigation by South Africa's anti-corruption watchdog said a judicial inquiry should be set up to further investigate allegations of criminal activity in Mr Zuma's government. Mr Zuma is accused of letting the Gupta family wield undue influence in his government. Both Mr Zuma and the Guptas have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Guptas also denied offering Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas $44.6m (?¡ê36.2m)  last year if he accepted the post of finance minister and advanced their business interests. Earlier this year, the Constitutional Court ruled that Mr Zuma had breached the constitution by failing to repay government money spent on his private home in rural Nkandla. A High Court has also ruled that he should be charged with 783 counts of corruption in relation to a 1999 arms deal. Mr Zuma has denied taking bribes, and has appealed against the ruling. In August, the ANC lost control of the key cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria in local elections, for the first time since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.

It comes weeks after the partner of a Guardian journalist was stopped under the same power, prompting a legal battle with the government. In his judgement on Wednesday, Lord Justice Gross said the stops were \"neither arbitrary nor disproportionate\". Lawyers for Mrs Beghal are expected to appeal and try to take the case to the Supreme Court. Mrs Beghal, a French citizen who lives in the UK, was stopped in January 2011 after arriving at East Midlands Airport on a flight from Paris. Police officers told her she was being held under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, a power that allows them to hold someone for up to nine hours and question them about whether they are involved in terrorism. Mrs Beghal's husband is an Algerian man who was convicted and jailed in France on terrorism charges. Djemal Beghal claims he was tortured and that his conviction is unfair. Following the stop, Mrs Beghal refused to answer police questions without the presence of a solicitor. She was allowed to speak to a lawyer on the phone before police asked her about her movements. When she refused to answer the questions, she was charged and later convicted of failing to comply with the order. In her challenge, lawyers argued that the powers under schedule 7 were so widely drawn that they meant that anyone could be stopped without reasonable suspicion. They said that those questioned at airports under the legislation were denied the right not to answer questions, unlike criminal suspects who were arrested and interviewed in a police station. Mrs Beghal also said that her detention at the airport breached her right to privacy and family life and restricted her freedom of movement between two EU countries. But dismissing the challenge, Lord Justice Gross said: \"The schedule 7 powers of examination survive the challenges advanced before us. \"In short, the balance struck between individual rights and the public interest in protection against terrorism does not violate the fundamental human rights in question.\" This latest challenge to the powers is wider than that launched by David Miranda, the partner of a Guardian journalist who was stopped at Heathrow Airport earlier this month. Mr Miranda alleges that the stop was unlawful because police wanted to seize his computer equipment rather than establish whether he was involved in terrorism.

At Dundee Sheriff Court a sheriff told him: \"This was a gross breach of trust.\" Francis, a qualified nurse, took over as a manager at the home in 1973. He was described as \"creepy\" and a \"Jekyll and Hyde character\" who subjected kids there to brutal physical attacks and sexual assaults. Three girls - aged 14 to 16 at the time- told a jury Francis would creep into the girls' dormitory at the home in the night and sexually assault them. A male resident at the home told how he had once run away and got as far as Kirkcaldy where he was picked up by police and taken back. Francis took him into a laundry room and attacked him as punishment. Other victims told how Francis slapped them in the face and beat them with a slipper in violent rages.

{"id": 1145, "article": "The president's choice of word immediately made headline news, reopening a familiar argument about whether it was fine for black people to reclaim and use the term but white people shouldn't, because it is nearly always a term of abuse - and of course, still is to many, as confirmed by a quick glance at Twitter after Mr Obama spoke. The point the president was trying to make was that, in his opinion, racism still exists in many aspects of US life and confronting it must go way beyond a philosophical discussion on whether certain words can or can't be uttered in polite company. Of course, reclaiming formerly offensive words isn't confined to racial minorities. Across western Europe, some gay men for example, have taken an offensive slur, \"queer\", and turned it into a badge of identity. Similarly, campaigners for women's rights in North America have been trying to reclaim the term \"slut\", transforming it into a mark of female sexual freedom. \"SlutWalks\" have now also taken place in Europe, Latin America and Asia. Yet there are problems. Reclaiming a word isn't necessarily the same thing as rehabilitating it. Take that word \"queer\" for example. It's used by a minority of gay men to describe their partial rejection of conventional society - for example, many self-defined \"queers\" reject marriage as an oppressive institution. They would be less happy about heterosexuals using that same word. And many heterosexuals in turn would be wary as well. That's partly from confusion - because \"queer\" is still deployed as a term of abuse. But there's also an issue of authenticity. Simply put, can those who live outside a minority group ever truly know what it's like to be a member of that community, especially if it's being oppressed, or has been in the past? Maybe not - so perhaps there should be caution about using language that implies that anybody can experience life - warts and all - on the same terms that minorities do. It's why Jewish comedians can get plenty of laughs as they poke fun at those much-maligned Jewish mothers - but why those same jokes might be construed as anti-Semitic if told by a non-Jew. More seriously, it also explains the derision that fans of rap music used to direct at white hip hop artists - because hip hop music grew out of, and spoke about, the unique experiences of young, black urban Americans. And rap in particular highlights some of the difficulties behind this whole issue. Many rap lyrics are liberally sprinkled with words which others find highly offensive - including the one which Mr Obama used. But many rappers feel their language is a realistic expression of how many young, black urban Americans live. They've walked the walk so have permission, they feel, to talk the talk. However it's the kind of talk that just can't appear in a piece of this kind - a perfect illustration of how hard it is to navigate a clear path around such sensitive issues. The authenticity factor also lies behind the criticism directed at Rachel Dolezal, the American civil rights activist who said she spoke from the personal perspective of being an African-American, but in fact was described by her parents as a white woman, with a trace of Native American ancestry. The debate about Barack Obama's choice of words reveals just how important context and authenticity are. And if you don't believe me, just try to envisage a white US president - perhaps Bill Clinton or one of the two Bushes - trying to sympathetically use the same racial term Mr Obama used. Or, Mr Obama cracking a joke about interfering Jewish mothers. I think you may feel a little bit uncomfortable.", "question": "Is it justified to ever use an offensive racist term - even if you 're trying to have a conversation about racism , as President Obama was when he used the \" N - word \" on a US radio programme ?

{"id": 1146, "article": "Most of the money spent by the Welsh Government is funded from the so-called block grant which it gets from the UK Treasury. In addition, the UK government spends money directly across the country, for example on the state pension and other benefits. Northern Ireland ¡ê11,106 Scotland ¡ê10,374 Wales ¡ê9,904 England ¡ê8,638 UK ¡ê8,913 The original reason that Wales gets less goes back to the 19th Century when the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Goschen, set out rules for extra spending in Scotland and Ireland.  Wales was included with England, so it didn't get the same bonus. That system developed into the block grants we still have today. They used to be re-negotiated every year until someone had the bright idea of coming up with a mathematical formula for deciding how much the grant should rise or fall each year. Joel Barnett was a Labour cabinet minister in the 1970s.  It was Barnett who developed the new rules, so the formula was named after him. The aim of the formula is to maintain the relative spending levels in different parts of the country. So if the UK government decides to spend an extra ¡ê1,000 per person on something that only covers England, the Barnett formula should mean that the block grant to Wales also goes up by ¡ê1,000 per person. To calculate how much the block grant needs to go up in total, the formula looks at the size of the Welsh population relative to the size of the population of England. At the moment it's about 5.7%. So for every pound of extra spending in England, Wales gets just under 6 pence. The formula also applies to spending cuts in the same way. It's not quite that simple, though. Not all areas of government policy are devolved. And some are more devolved than others. So the formula also includes another factor: the \"comparability percentage\" for each area of spending. The idea here is that the amount of extra funding that goes to Wales and the other nations should depend on the extent to which the particular area of spending is devolved. So for fully devolved areas like education, extra spending in England is matched fully, on a per-person basis, in Wales. Health is also considered to be almost completely devolved. But for spending on culture, media, and sport the estimate is about 77%. In other words, for every extra pound per person of spending on sport announced by the UK government, the Welsh Government gets an extra 77 pence per person. The critical thing to remember is that the Barnett formula only governs the annual change to the block grant. It's not responsible for the original disparity in levels of spending across different parts of the UK. It does help to maintain the existing gaps in cash terms. But over time that should actually mean that the disparities between the nations become less significant. In later life Lord Barnett, who was made a member of the House of Lords in 1983 and died in 2014, said that the formula was \"grossly unfair\" and should be abolished. In 2015 the UK government introduced a funding floor for Wales, promising that public spending per head should not fall below 115% of the figure for England. That should ensure that the additional money it receives compared to England is maintained, but it probably won't do anything to help Wales catch up with Scotland or Northern Ireland.", "question": "Less government money is spent for each person in Wales than in Scotland or Northern Ireland .

After all the trouble we have gone to in rescuing @ASFCofficial is the @premierleague really threatening to close us down?\" He had earlier posted a series of messages on Twitter after the Daily Mail revealed reported figures of wages and agent fees paid by Manchester United. In them, he accused the Premier League of \"destroying\" the game. Accrington finished 13th in League Two this season with an average gate of 1,699 - the smallest in the Football League. Holt told BBC Radio Lancashire the club usually has an annual turnover of about ¡ê2.2m and would expect losses of about ¡ê500,000 most seasons, but that should be less for 2016-17 because of their cup runs. \"It is all very well for the Premier League to take an isolated view that what they're doing doesn't affect anybody else, but my argument is that it does,\" he added. \"When you do things for the game, you've got to look at the entire game - you can't just deal with them in isolation. \"They generate all the cash and they need get some of it spread about.\" The Premier League statement added: \"The Premier League supports all clubs in the EFL with solidarity payments and provides significant funding for their community projects and youth development schemes - all things that Accrington Stanley benefit from. \"It is only because of the interest in our competition and in Premier League clubs that we can support Accrington, the wider football pyramid, and communities and schools across the country.\" BBC sports editor Dan Roan Ever since the Premier League broke away 25 years ago, there has been intense debate about how much it should redistribute; to the grassroots, to fans via cheaper tickets, to community projects, and also to lower-league clubs. Buoyed by their latest record-breaking ¡ê8bn broadcast deal, Premier League clubs will pay Football League teams the following in 'solidarity payments' this year; ¡ê4.3m to each Championship side, and ¡ê650,000 and ¡ê430,000 respectively to clubs in League One and Two. These payments have risen, and are now linked to TV income. But given the financial challenges and debts many Football League clubs face, and the vast sums their Premier League counterparts give to players and agents, some believe they should be more generous. Mr Holt has effectively 'bitten the hand that feeds' his club, hence the Premier League's thinly-veiled threat to withdraw funding.

{"id": 1148, "article": "Kaori Okuni, one of the women campaigning for change, said the ruling would lead to \"suffering for those who plan to marry and those who are set to be born\". Most women in Japan end up taking their husband's surname, a practice set to continue after Wednesday's ruling. But what do other countries do? In most well-populated countries, women are free to change their surname on marrying, if they wish. Many go further than that, putting in place laws stating that women do not have to change their names. France's law has been in place since the 18th century but, much like in Italy, there is some flexibility allowing wives to use their husband's surnames in an informal way. On all official paperwork, however, the maiden name must remain. The laws are much tougher in Greece and Quebec. In Greece, you must petition a court for a name change, and in Quebec, even if they wanted to, a wife cannot take her husband's surname at any point. In Iceland, women keep their maiden names after marriage. A surname is derived from a father's first name - so Bjork, Gudmund's daughter, becomes Bjork Gudmundsdottir - or, in certain circumstances, the mother's. A similar pattern is also followed in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where there is no concept of surnames as known in many Western countries. At birth, people are given one name, that is then followed by the father's name then the grandfather's name. Even after marrying, women retain their original three names. Could the Avatar actress Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego - now Marco Saldana - be trend setters? The couple announced the move earlier this year, with Mrs Saldana calling her husband \"a man who stood by change\". In one case from 2012, however, a Mississippi man needed the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to take his wife's surname, having initially been prevented from changing the name on his driving licence.

The last wave of protests led by Mr Navalny ended with hundreds arrested. Those protests were the largest since 2012, drawing thousands of people - including many teenagers - to rallies nationwide, angered by a report Mr Navalny published accusing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of corruption. By calling crowds into the very centre of Moscow, Alexei Navalny has set the stage for a confrontation.

Justin Trickett and Sam Illidge were also stabbed but their wounds were less severe. The court heard the attack was the result of a \"turf war\" which had erupted between two rival gangs over the control of the drugs trade in the Rhyl area. The defendants and Melia were members of the \"Pensarn Crew\", sometimes called \"Ste's Crew\", Mr Lewis said. Mr Mason and the others were members of \"Mark's Crew\", or \"Marco's Crew\" - although it was not suggested that Mr Mason was the leader. \"The fatal attack appears to have been an act of retribution on the part of the defendants and Melia,\" Mr Lewis added. Jurors were shown CCTV footage of a white Renault van near The Cob area of Rhyl on the afternoon of 27 October, with \"an incident\" taking place in the background.

Mr Temer is accused of receiving money from the executives of a meatpacking firm implicated in a corruption scandal. He denies any wrongdoing. It is the first time that a sitting Brazilian president has faced charges. Mr Temer rejected the evidence presented by chief prosecutor Rodrigo Janot, saying he mounted a baseless case that was an assault on his \"dignity\" and sought to \"paralyse\" Brazil as it recovers from a two-year recession. \"Where are the concrete proofs of my receiving this money?\" Mr Temer asked during the televised address from the presidential palace in Brasilia. \"I will not allow myself to be accused of crimes that I did not commit.\" The charges have been delivered to a Supreme Court judge who must now decide if the case can be sent to the lower house of parliament. If the corruption case reaches the lower house, Mr Temer's coalition believes it can gather enough votes to block the two-thirds majority needed for him to be put on trial in the court. JBS executives have been implicated in Operation Car Wash, the vast investigation into corruption at state oil giant Petrobras. The investigation, launched in March 2014, centres on companies that were offered deals with Petrobras in exchange for bribes, which were funnelled into politicians' pockets and political-party slush funds. Last month, an audio recording was released in which Mr Temer appears to be discussing bribes in conversation with JBS chairman Joesley Batista. The recording, made using a hidden device, was presented in plea bargain negotiations between prosecutors and JBS executives. Meanwhile, President Temer could face a further charge of obstruction of justice. Mr Temer, a former law professor, has vowed to remain in office despite calls for him to step down.

Mandela's widow Graca Machel complained bitterly about aspects in the book. The outcry was supported by other Mandela family members. This simply means that Mr Mandela's physician and author of the book Dr Vejay Ramlakan has been isolated. He was adamant that he consulted everyone who needed to be consulted from the family prior to writing the book. Clearly this has backfired now.

The auction at Sotheby's was the first time a rough diamond of such a size has gone on public sale. Why have so many huge diamonds been found recently?

{"id": 1185, "article": "Dr Kenneth Heaton says many doctors fail to connect psychological problems with physical symptoms - and argues the playwright could help them do it. He listed dozens of examples in which Shakespeare described these phenomena in his works. \"They could learn to be better doctors by studying Shakespeare,\" he said. While traditional medical school training never strays far from the science of diagnosis and treatment, there has been growing interest in recent years in including courses on health-related art, history or literature as part of the curriculum. Dr Heaton, from North Somerset, who studied Shakespeare after retiring from his post as a gastroenterologist, believes that a broader perspective could make it easier to understand the viewpoint and needs of a patient, particularly in general practice. His latest research, published in the journal Medical Humanities, focuses on real symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, fainting, and disturbed hearing, produced by underlying emotional distress, which can sometimes confuse doctors as they have no obvious physical cause. The frequency of these psychological illnesses in Shakespeare should be a mark not only of his \"body-conscious\" approach, but also of their importance to doctors, he believes. Notable examples include the fatigue suffered by Hamlet, grief-stricken for his murdered father, who complains of his \"weary, stale, flat and unprofitable\" existence, and the headache suffered by the cuckolded Othello. In King Lear, when Gloucester is led to the point of attempting suicide, his son Edgar notes that his \"senses grow imperfect\" because of his anguish. In Romeo and Juliet, feelings of both coldness and faintness are used to convey shock. In all Dr Heaton found at least 43 references to physical problems caused by psychological stress in Shakespeare's works - far more than in other authors of the same period. He said that the reluctance of modern doctors to attribute physical symptoms to emotional disturbance could cause delayed diagnoses, and unnecessary tests and treatment. \"Shakespeare had an extraordinary insight into the psychology of human beings, extending to the emotional effects on the body. \"Some medical schools have more in the way of humanities teaching than others, but many doctors would be able to learn something from Shakespeare.\" Dr Paul Lazarus, a senior clinical educator from the University of Leicester, is one of those advocating a broader curriculum at medical schools, possibly including subjects such as the history of medicine, its depiction in literature and art, and even the architecture of hospitals.

The play, by Jack Thorne, is set 19 years after the seventh and final book in the series by JK Rowling. Rowling has asked audiences not to reveal details of the story. \"You've been amazing for years at keeping Harry Potter secrets so you didn't spoil the books for readers who came after you,\" she said in a video message. \"So I'm asking you one more time to keep the secrets and let audiences enjoy Cursed Child with all the surprises that we've built into the story.\" The play is the eighth story in the series and the first time an official Harry Potter story has been presented on stage. Thorne's two-parter, written in collaboration with Rowling and director John Tiffany, will feature a cast of more than 30 actors. Picking up from where the Deathly Hallows epilogue left off, it portrays Harry, played by Jamie Parker, as an \"over-worked\" employee at the Ministry of Magic. The story will explore how his youngest son Albus (Sam Clemmett) deals with the \"heavy burden\" of the Potter family legacy. Other familiar characters include Hermione Granger (Noma Dumezweni), Ron Weasley (Paul Thornley), Ginny Potter (Poppy Miller) and Draco Malfoy (Alex Price). Rowling on Tuesday tweeted a good luck message to Anthony Boyle, who plays Draco's son Scorpius. In an interview with The Observer, Rowling spoke of her frustration at online reaction by \"a bunch of racists\" to the casting of a black actress in the role of Hermione.

Its director said this was not science fiction and would be day-to-day practice in the NHS within a decade. The centre will also investigate how cancers become resistant to drugs. The field of cancer research is moving rapidly away from defining a cancer by where it is in the body - one type of breast cancer can have more in common with an ovarian cancer than another cancer in the breast. Instead scientists and doctors are looking deeper at what is going wrong inside cancerous cells - a tumour can have 100,000 genetic mutations and these alter over time. Rapid advances in being able to sequence the genetic code of patients are allowing breakthroughs in understanding which mutations transform a healthy cell into a cancerous one. Identifying the mutations can then be used to choose the best treatment. The most famous example of this is the drug Herceptin, which is used in breast cancers with a certain genetic abnormality. The new centre will test samples from patients at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. The ICR's director, Prof Alan Ashworth, said: \"None of this is science fiction. This is now happening. We think we're pioneering the clinical application of this by setting up the Tumour Profiling Unit, but one would think this would be absolutely routine practice for every cancer patient - and that's what we're aiming to bring about.\" One great challenge with cancer treatment is resistance. Promising drugs suddenly fail after a few months. Prof Ashworth described it as a \"bit like the game whack-a-mole\" with a new method of resistance popping up every time a drug kicks a cancer down. The Tumour Profiling Unit will repeatedly test cancer samples to see how the tumour changes in an attempt to understand resistance. Other challenges for the field include storing the data. The genetic codes of one million cancer patients would take up the same amount of space as YouTube. Implementing this form of genetic testing into the NHS is another issue. The test results would need to be made available rapidly and in a way that is easy for doctors to interpret and decide on treatments. The government has recently announced that up to 100,000 patients with cancer and rare diseases in England are to have their entire genetic code sequenced to aid research.", "question": "The @placeholder changes that turn healthy tissue into cancer are to be investigated in the biggest centre of its kind in the NHS .", "option_0": "molecular", "option_1": "devastating", "option_2": "annual", "option_3": "troubled", "option_4": "national"}

Sea lice feed on the skin and blood of salmon, and can weaken the health of fish and its growth. In its annual report, Marine Harvest highlighted the impact of the parasites on its operations in Scotland, where it operates more than 50 sites. Last year, it harvested about 45,000 tonnes of salmon of Scottish origin - more than 5,000 less than in 2015.

The 60-year-old has spent four years at West Ham, but the Hammers have decided not to renew his deal this summer. Allardyce said: \"I didn't want to stay. I suppose you could say it was mutual if they didn't want me to stay either.\" West Ham will now begin the search for a successor, although they look likely to miss out on top target Rafael Benitez, as the Napoli boss is linked with Real Madrid. \"I thought it was the right time to leave - and probably the right time for me and the club,\" added ex-Bolton and Newcastle boss Allardyce, who now plans to take an extended break from the game. Allardyce learned of his fate on Friday, but the news was made public on Sunday afternoon at the conclusion of the 2014-15 Premier League season. In a statement, joint chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold said: \"We would like to start by thanking Sam Allardyce for his valuable work since arriving at the Boleyn Ground four years ago. \"He leaves the club in a considerably better state than when he arrived and, for that, the board are truly grateful.\" Allardyce added: \"I knew it was coming and I have no problems with it. We had the discussion and I wasn't going to sign a new contract so it was probably time to move on. \"It's done and dusted and we both move on. West Ham have a big job appointing a new manager moving forward and I have the job of seeing my family for a change. This job is 24/7 and it's time for me to give the family a bit more time.\" Sullivan and Gold want a new manager to oversee the club's final season at their current home before a move to the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 campaign. The statement was released just minutes after West Ham lost their final Premier League game of the season 2-0 at Newcastle - a result which ensured their opponents avoided relegation and meant the Hammers finished 12th. Allardyce says he has no intention of making a quick return to football, adding: \"For me four years is a long time and I don't want to overstay my welcome. You have to commit your whole life to being a Premier League manager. \"It's time to have that break. I'm looking to have a break, recharge the batteries and when the batteries are recharged you are better prepared to carry on doing the job at this level. \"It's not just a job I'm after, it's the right job. You can never say never but I can't see myself being in charge of another football club at the start of next season.\" West Ham United's supporters made it clear what they felt of the unloved Allardyce as abuse rained down from the stands at St James' Park as they lost to Newcastle United. And while it is true the 60-year-old is a managerial taste that will never be acquired by some, Allardyce can rightly be pleased with his four years at Upton Park. The brief from owners David Sullivan and David Gold was to get the Hammers into the Premier League and keep them there - two missions he accomplished comfortably. Allardyce, in other words, has done a solid job at West Ham and it will take a lot to move them even further forward. He may not have been a popular figure among the fanbase - not that he seemed to care - but this is a manager who did what he was asked to do.

{"id": 1234, "article": "The whereabouts of Nefertiti's remains are not known, although those of Tutankhamun - who may have been her son - were found in 1922. New tests have shown there may be a portal leading from King Tut's tomb. Nicholas Reeves, an archaeologist at the University of Arizona, says he believes Nefertiti may lie inside. One leading Egyptologist urged caution over the conclusion but said that, if confirmed, it would be \"brilliant\". The finds were made last year, after the Spanish artistic and preservation specialists, Factum Arte, were commissioned to produce detailed scans of Tutankhamun's tomb. The scans were then used to produce a facsimile of the tomb near the site of the original Valley of the Kings in Luxor. While assessing the scans last February, Dr Reeves spotted what he believed were marks indicating where two doorways used to be. \"I have been testing the evidence ever since, looking for indications that what I thought I was seeing was, in fact, not there,\" Dr Reeves told the BBC. \"But the more I looked, the more information I found that I seemed to be looking at something pretty real.\" The layout of Tutankhamun's tomb has been a puzzle for some time - in particular, why it was smaller than those of other kings' tombs. Dr Reeves believes there are clues in the design of the tomb that indicate it was designed to store the remains of a queen, not a king. \"If I'm wrong, I'm wrong,\" he said. \"But if I'm right, the prospects are frankly staggering. The world will have become a much more interesting place - at least for Egyptologists.\" After being discovered by English archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922, the tomb of Tutankhamun was opened in February the following year. It was the most intact Egyptian tomb ever discovered, and very few objects appeared to have been plundered. Close to 2,000 objects were found, and it took archaeologists nine years to catalogue them all. If the same amount of objects were found elsewhere in the tomb, it would represent \"quite a coup,\" said Dr Reeves. Neither Egyptian authorities nor Factum Arte have responded to the claims. \"I think there are certainly some signs that there might have been some activity around those doorways,\" said Joyce Tyldesley, an Egyptologist with the University of Manchester. \"Whether we can deduct from that that we actually the burial site of Nefertiti might be a step too far. \"But if it was true, it would be absolutely brilliant.\"", "question": "An archaeologist says he may have found evidence that Nefertiti , the former Queen of Egypt , is @placeholder buried inside Tutankhamun 's tomb .", "option_0": "indeed", "option_1": "not", "option_2": "now", "option_3": "secretly", "option_4": "reportedly"}

The court has heard Ms Williams was obsessed by Mr Johnston, 57, and \"eliminated\" Ms Hartley with the help of Katrina Walsh, 56,  who also denies murder, when he refused to leave her. Mr Johnston, who had been in an \"intermittent\", \"intimate\" relationship with communications director Ms Hartley, began a sexual relationship with Ms Williams after they met in December 2012.

John McDermott, prosecuting, said Mr Johnston and Ms Williams exchanged naked photographs on 3, 4 and 5 December last year. Mr Johnston said he didn't block the messages and responded \"in kind\" to Ms Williams' messages.

It is unclear whether the deal will satisfy thousands of striking workers, many of whom have been dismissed after their action was ruled illegal. The strikes have slashed production and cost the industry millions of dollars. Strikes in the platinum and coal sectors, which are not covered by Thursday's agreement, have also raged for weeks. More than 40 people died in violent clashes between police and striking workers at a platinum mine in August. The National Treasury said on Thursday that strikes across the mining industry had cost the country's economy 10bn rand ($1.1bn; ?¡ê710m). South Africa is one of the world's biggest producers of precious metals. Unions and employers gave few details of Thursday's agreement. By Matthew DaviesBBC News, Johannesburg Thursday's deal looks like a tentative step to ending all the strikes in the gold sector. But the impasse in the platinum sector still exists and many mines remain closed. Part of the problem is that platinum mines, unlike their counterparts in the gold industry, tend to negotiate with their own workers rather than with all the workers across the sector. This is why workers for the Lonmin firm got a 22% wage increase but 12,000 of those at Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) who were out on a wildcat strike were sacked. Amplats expects its refined platinum production to fall to between 2.2m and 2.4m ounces this year. The Treasury says that the production of platinum group metals slumped by more than 15% in August, compared with a year earlier. How strikes have hit SA economy NUM spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said the deal represented a 10.8% wage increase, but did not specify which workers would be affected. \"The worst in the gold sector is over. Members have accepted a new pay structure,\" he said. But he added that the deal would only cover the next few months, and negotiations would resume in February. Marian van der Walt of Harmony Gold, one of the firms represented by the Chamber of Mines, welcomed the deal. \"We're very pleased that they signed [to] bring all of the uncertainty and turmoil in the market to an end,\" she said. Harmony said 98% of its striking workforce had now returned to work. Another firm, Gold Fields, also welcomed the agreement. Gold Fields said more than 28,000 of its workers had gone out on strike, 8,100 of whom had been dismissed after they failed to honour an ultimatum to return to work. On Thursday a spokesman said 7,300 of the sacked workers had appealed against their dismissals. Analysts say workers across the industry are disaffected with the NUM and other mainstream unions, regarding them as too close to the employers.

Prosecutors say about €12m (¡ê10.4m; $13.5m) was spent on hotels, fine clothes, entertainment and travel. Mr Rato denies wrongdoing. Bankia was rescued in 2012 at huge public expense. The unofficial credit card purchases were not declared to the tax authorities. The system allegedly started at Caja Madrid bank and was continued by Mr Rato when Bankia was created in 2011. How Spanish activists landed ex-IMF chief in court A member of the governing centre-right Popular Party (PP), Mr Rato resigned as head of Bankia shortly before its near-collapse in 2012. The government bailout of Bankia inflicted losses on 200,000 small investors, who held preferential shares in the bank. Some of them voiced their anger outside the Madrid courthouse on Monday. \"You wretches! Stealing money from pensioners!\" they shouted at the accused as the trial got under way. Prosecutors are seeking four-and-a-half years in jail for Mr Rato and six years for Miguel Blesa, the former president of Caja Madrid, a bank that was merged with six others in 2011 to create Bankia. If found guilty, Mr Rato could also face a €2.7m fine, and Mr Blesa a fine of €9.3m. Mr Rato headed the International Monetary Fund from 2004-2007. He also served as Spanish economy minister, and his fall from grace helped fuel accusations that the Popular Party was riddled with corruption. Prosecutors say the lavish credit card purchases took place from 2003-2012 - some of them during Spain's financial crisis, when millions of citizens suffered hardship and unemployment soared. Mr Rato's two successors at the top of the IMF have also been caught up in high-profile court cases. French Socialist Dominique Strauss-Kahn took over from Mr Rato in 2007 but resigned in May 2011 to defend himself against charges of attempted rape in New York. Prosecutors dropped the charges later that year, then Mr Strauss-Kahn reached an out-of-court settlement with the hotel maid who accused him. In a separate case last year, he was acquitted by a French court of the charge of \"aggravated pimping\" in connection with sex parties involving prostitutes.

The EEF said even before the election firms were already altering or thinking about changing their business plans because of the Brexit vote. Terry Scuoler, EEF chief executive, said the government had already \"wasted a year\" and needed to \"move away from its previous rhetoric and start repairing relations with EU partners\".

It is also calling for a \"suitable\" transition period to be \"firmly back on the table\" as part of the Brexit talks.

{"id": 1268, "article": "It is now three months since Muhammadu Buhari was sworn in as president of Nigeria and five months since he won historic elections, the first time an opposition candidate had won. His victory generated huge celebrations and expectations of a new beginning, with many anticipating dramatic changes to follow, and analysts urging him to \"hit the ground running\". Most Nigerians expected President Buhari to shake up the security services and make other key appointments in his first few days - as former President Olusegun Obasanjo did within hours of his inauguration in 1999. But it took nearly two months for him to replace his security chiefs and so far he has only made appointments in about a dozen government offices. When commentators began to get agitated about the lack of a cabinet, a former newspaper editor and unofficial aide to the president wrote an article entitled What is all the fuss about? He urged the press, social media and others to focus on the \"real enemies of Nigeria: poverty, ignorance, disease and squalor\" and not stand in the way of \"the most popular president in our history\". \"The new government came into power through people's powera€|. Therefore, its duty should be to constructively plan and execute people's policies and not worry too much about who gets what post,\" he said. He is right up to a point - though the new democratic halo around President Buhari does make it difficult for many to publicly criticise him. A leak from the highest level then said there would not be a cabinet before September. The justification, according to the source, was that \"almost everything is in a state of decay\". \"There is absolutely no way the new government can hope to achieve anything long-lasting without first building a new foundation.\" This was followed by an opinion article by President Buhari published in the Washington Post to coincide with his visit to the US last month, making further justifications about why the task \"should not be rushed\". \"It is worth noting that [US President Barack] Obama himself did not have his full cabinet in place for several months after first taking office; the United States did not cease to function in the interim,\" he said. \"In Nigeria's case, it would neither be prudent nor serve the interests of sound government to have made these appointments immediately on my elevation to the presidency; instead, Nigeria must first put new rules of conduct and good governance in place.\" The commentators are now learning to live with President Buhari's pace of governance. He has been dealing directly with the top civil servants, who run the ministries. Mannir Dan Ali: \"With the briefings he is getting from civil servants, the ministers, when they are eventually appointed, will find that their boss knows more about their departments than they do\" Though it is not only the cabinet that is not yet in place. Just after he took office in May, the senate said he was allowed to appoint 15 special advisers. Yet only a few have been appointed and there is currently no adviser on the national assembly to serve as a link between the executive and legislature. This could be seen as a mistake given the current friction between the presidency and the senate over the election of the chamber's president, who was not the ruling party's chosen candidate. Meanwhile, it is the politicians who are suffering most from the lack of a cabinet. On a visit to a newspaper a few days ago, a spokesman for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Lai Mohammed, admitted that no-one in the party knew when the appointments would be. \"The president I know has kept this thing very close to his chest.\" Muhammadu Buhari profile: Buhari's to-do list Is Buhari a changed man? However, it is not only the politicians who are in a limbo. Many sectors of the economy await policy direction.

The move came after the bureau of prisons rejected the Army's request to transfer her from a military facility. She is serving a 35-year sentence for leaking classified files to Wikileaks. Pte Manning has been diagnosed by military doctors with gender dysphoria, the sense of one's gender being at odds with the sex assigned at birth. Following her conviction in July 2013 on 20 charges in connection with the leaks of military and diplomatic documents, Pte Manning requested treatment including hormone therapy, and to be allowed to live as a woman. A lawyer for Pte Manning threatened in May to sue the Army if she was not given sex change therapy in military prison. Nancy Hollander argued the military had an obligation to treat the soldier's \"transgender issues\", and she would not be safe if transferred to a civilian prison for treatment there. Ms Hollander told the BBC that Pte Manning had not suffered harassment at the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, even though her fellow inmates knew she was transgender. In April, a judge granted her petition to change her name legally from Bradley to Chelsea, and according to a court filing by Pte Manning's legal team, a military doctor at Fort Leavenworth had approved a treatment plan by November 2013. The US military is required to offer medical treatment to its soldiers, but Pentagon policy prohibits transgender people from serving openly in the military. Pte Manning will not be discharged from the military until she has finished her prison term. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said earlier the policy on transgender service members should be \"continuously reviewed\" but has not said whether he believes the policy should be overturned.

The UK's need to expand its airport capacity in a bid to meet growing demand for air travel means introducing an extra runway in the south east of England. The short-listed options include a new runway for Heathrow, a new runway for Gatwick, or the extension of an existing runway at Heathrow. Stewart Wingate, chief executive of Gatwick Airport, believes Scotland's direct air routes would be at risk if Heathrow were to gain a monopoly by being chosen over Gatwick for expansion. He said: \"The choice boils down to competition versus monopoly. Do we want to protect and strengthen Scotland's growing network of routes by creating a competitive system across the UK, or put that at risk by creating a monopolistic mega-hub at London Heathrow? \"The Airports Commission itself found that in every future scenario, Scotland will have a larger share of the UK airports market if Gatwick expands. \"That amounts to 14% more daily scheduled international services from airports outside London and 50 million more passengers through Scotland's airports.\" But John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive at Heathrow, claimed that an expansion at Gatwick would result in Scottish firms losing out to rivals based near London while a Heathrow option would \"drive more value for the Scottish economy\". He said: \"It would mean 16,000 new jobs in Scotland, ?¡ê14bn to the Scottish economy and that's because Heathrow helps connect Scotland to more global markets that aren't serviced by Scottish airports directly.\" Mr Holland-Kaye added that there are currently 15 to 20 long-haul direct routes to and from Scottish airports and a further 75 routes are covered by Heathrow. He conceded that flights between Scotland and Heathrow had reduced but added that this was because \"Heathrow is at capacity so airlines have had to make a choice between adding new flights to long-haul destinations and maintaining flights to Scotland\".

{"id": 1291, "article": "It is plastic horn, brightly coloured, and seen in abundance at sporting events in South Africa. The first vuvuzelas seen at sporting events in the early 90s were made from a sheet of metal. A standard vuvuzela is 65cm long but some can be up to a metre long. No-one really knows. The most commonly-held belief is that it is related to the kudu horn that was blown to summon African villagers to meetings. However, earlier this year, the Nazareth Baptist Church claimed the vuvuzela as its own - used by its members on pilgrimages - and threatened legal action to stop them being used at the World Cup. Again, it appears to be a matter of debate. Some think it comes from the Zulu word for \"making noise\". Others say it is township slang for \"shower\" because it \"showers people with music\".  Many believe it means \"pump up\". The Nazarath Baptist Church says it \"lost\" the vuvuzela back in the 1990s when a supporter of South Africa's biggest football team visited the church. Unable to take the long metal trumpet inside the football grounds, he re-modelled it in plastic. Vuvuzela-makers say they began to mass-produce the instrument in plastic when the original tin version began to make appearances at games during the 1990s. The typical pitch of a vuvuzela is said to be B flat below middle C. On its own, it has been compared unflatteringly to an elephant passing wind. When there is a football terrace full of the instruments, the sound has been likened to a swarm of angry wasps. Recent tests found noise levels from a vuvuzela, at full volume and when pressed against your ear, equates to 127 decibels. This is louder than a drum at 122 decibels, a chainsaw at 100 decibels and a referee's whistle at 121.8 decibels. The Hear the World Foundation - set up by Swiss hearing products group Phonax to raise awareness about hearing loss - has warned that extended exposure to such noise risks permanent hearing loss. They have been urging fans to use protection, such as ear plugs and ear muffs. Some South African shopkeepers say they have run out of ear plugs called Vuvu-Stops. Neil van Schalkwyk of Masincedane Sport - a vuvuzela-maker - says his firm has now produced an instrument that is 20 decibels lower than the older version. Well, a London doctor is warning that the vuvuzela could also spread colds and flu germs. Dr Ruth McNerney, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told The Associated Press that the instrument has the potential to infect those seated near a person blowing a vuvuzela because a \"lot of breath goes through\" it. She said a recent study found that aerosols, tiny droplets which can carry flu and cold germs, were formed at the bottom of a vuvuzela after people had blown into them. Those particles are small enough to stay suspended in the air for hours, and can enter into the airways of a person's lungs, Dr McNerney said. Several players complained about the vuvuzela when they were first heard during the Confederations Cup last year, a World Cup dress rehearsal. Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk has banned them from his team's training sessions, and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo admitted this week: \"It is difficult for anyone on the pitch to concentrate.\" Even some fans watching matches on their television have reported having to put the sound on mute to escape the cacophany. Yes. They've had a ringing endorsement from Fifa President Sepp Blatter who says they will not be banned. He said on Twitter that \"Africa has a different rhythm, a different sound\" and it is an important tradition among South African fans that should be celebrated. England player Jamie Carragher says he will be taking some vuvuzelas home with him. \"My kids have been on the phone and they want two. I've got two in my bag already\". On the contrary. Neil van Schalkwyk says his firm has sold 1.5m vuvuzelas in Europe since October and expects sales of up to 20 million rand ($2.6m; ?¡ê1.7m) over the course of the tournament. Brandon Bernardo of the vuvuzela.co.za website told Reuters news agency they could churn out at least 10,000 instruments a day. \"We're completely sold out,\" he said. Furthermore, a Dutch designer firm has released a Vuvuzela 2010 app. According to its website, they have had 750,000 downloads of the application. Even without the World Cup, South Africa's vuvuzela industry is said to be worth around 50 million rand ($6.45m; ?¡ê4.4m).", "question": "The Vuvuzela has become the unofficial symbol of the 2010 World Cup - and seems to be loved and @placeholder in equal measure .

{"id": 1294, "article": "The Hammers took the lead inside 10 minutes when Carroll lost his marker to head in a Manuel Lanzini corner. The hosts hit back with a well-worked move that ended with Cristhian Stuani tapping in Calum Chambers' low cross. Carroll pounced after Victor Valdes tipped away Michail Antonio's low effort to give West Ham the lead at the break. Boro threw on January signings Patrick Bamford and Rudy Gestede, but the Hammers added to their lead on the break late on through Jonathan Calleri. It means Middlesbrough's winless run in the top flight now stretches to five games. West Ham boss Slaven Bilic said Carroll had suffered whiplash after scoring an acrobatic overhead kick last week against Crystal Palace but, despite taking a couple of days off training during the week, the powerful centre forward looked sharp at the Riverside. He only touched the ball twice in the Middlesbrough box in the 67 minutes before he was taken off, but found the net on both occasions - and he has now scored five goals since his return from injury in early December. With Dimitri Payet left out of Bilic's match-day squad amid rumours he is set to leave London Stadium, Carroll offers the Hammers a very different threat. The former Newcastle and Liverpool man won 70% of his duels against Boro, only bettered in the West Ham starting XI by captain Mark Noble, and his aerial prowess also proved key to the visitors when defending set-pieces. Middlesbrough's struggles in front of goal have been well documented this season, and they headed into the game having scored the fewest in the top four leagues apart from Oldham. But Aitor Karanka's side can feel aggrieved at not taking something from this one. They enjoyed over 60% possession and delivered 27 crosses to West Ham's eight from open play - only capitalising on one of those. Karanka has bolstered his squad's attacking threat with the January signings of Bamford and Gestede, the former scoring 17 goals during his last spell at the Riverside in the Championship, but neither had time to have an impact on the game. It was winger Adama Traore who proved the biggest nuisance for West Ham, first down the right-hand side with the on-loan Chambers and then on the left when he linked up with George Friend. Karanka said after the game the 20-year-old has \"an amazing future\", but he will surely hope to keep him for at least another transfer window as Boro look to avoid relegation. Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: \"As a manager I cannot be more proud of my players than I am now. They have done every single thing. We win as a team, lose as a team. We have to work on the last 10, 15 minutes.\" On whether keeper Victor Valdes was at fault for Andy Carroll's second goal: \"Victor Valdes is having an amazing season, helping us a lot. \"He is one of the best keepers in the world and us as a club have to be proud to have players like him.\" West Ham manager Slaven Bilic: \"It was a good week for us after Palace, the confidence we played with, and we used that momentum to come here and put out a strong performance and get three massive points.\" On Carroll's goalscoring form: \"Week in, week out he is a brilliant player. Not only goals, he makes an impact with his presence. His work rate is quality and he is unbeatable in the box. It is very hard to stop him. \"He loves it. He gives you everything.

The controversial move prompted the government to launch a review of the Lords' powers, which recommended they should lose their absolute veto over secondary legislation. The BBC says the documentary will show the \"characters\" who populate the upper chamber and \"their aims, dilemmas and frustrations\". The programme will take in the current arguments about whether, and how, to pursue reform of the House of Lords. Fiona Campbell, head of BBC Current Affairs, hailed it as a chance \"to shed some light for our viewers on the inner workings of this long-standing pillar of politics in this country\". Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza said: \"The House of Lords is often misunderstood because there are few opportunities for the public to find out about its role and work.\" She described the series as an \"opportunity to see the important work that is done by the House\". Peers held a debate in January on their public image in which a number of members complained about the lack of understanding of their role and the way they are portrayed in the press. Lord Hodgson of Astley-Abbots, who tabled the debate, expressed his concern about \"the rising number of snide, unfounded and unhelpful articles about your Lordships' House that are quite unconnected with our legislative activities\".", "question": "BBC Two has commissioned a series filmed inside the House of Lords which it says will give \" @placeholder \" insight into peers ' work .", "option_0": "treacherous", "option_1": "controversial", "option_2": "real", "option_3": "unprecedented", "option_4": "urgent"}

{"id": 1304, "article": "Was it ever serious about moving its headquarters - to Hong Kong in particular? Well, when the discussions first started in April 2015, there were certainly senior executives who could see the attractions of moving. Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, who has spent most of his banking life in Asia, was believed to be one of them. He would privately point out that the banking levy introduced by the coalition government wiped out the profits the bank made in the UK. The tax particularly affected banks like HSBC as it was levied on worldwide assets. HSBC has a very large business outside the UK. It is not called the Hong Kong, Shanghai Banking Corporation for nothing. The mood of the bank certainly changed when George Osborne decided after the last election to change the levy to a surcharge on banks' UK profits. That hit banks with mainly British businesses like Lloyds harder. And saved HSBC money. Mr Osborne knew that a major bank leaving London would be a major blow. And there was certainly delight in the Treasury. And more fuel for the critics who claim that Mr Osborne changed policy to keep HSBC in the UK. For HSBC itself, the decision wasn't just about the tax environment in the UK. There was also the problem of the regulatory environment in China - with the central bank causing nervousness among investors and volatility in the markets after intervening in the stock and currency markets. Poorer news about the Chinese economy also focused minds at HSBC's Canary Wharf headquarters in London's docklands. One interesting point to make about the decision is that whatever fears HSBC has about Britain possibly leaving the European Union, London's attraction as a financial capital was more significant. Which raises a challenge for those who argue that businesses could quit the UK if Britain were to leave the EU. \"The UK is an important and globally connected economy,\" HSBC said in a statement. \"It has an internationally respected regulatory framework and legal system, and immense experience in handling complex international affairs. \"London is one of the world's leading international financial centres and home to a large pool of highly skilled, international talent. \"It remains therefore ideally positioned to be the home base for a global financial institution such as HSBC.\" Some argue that London's financial status could be put at risk if Britain leaves the EU. Indeed, HSBC has itself raised its concerns. But the bank's decision shows that it is a much more nuanced debate than those for or against membership of the European Union might argue. HSBC has said that it will not review the decision about where it is headquartered unless there is a \"material change in circumstances\". Whether the referendum on whether Britain remains in or leaves the EU constitutes a \"material\" change remains to be seen.", "question": "Was it all a bluff ?

Several children were among the dead. More than one million migrants crossed the Mediterranean in 2015 and the vast majority went from Turkey to Greece.

Honey Rose, 35, from Newham, East London, performed a routine eye test on the child five months earlier. She said she had \"done her best\" for him. But jurors at Ipswich Crown Court found her guilty after a 10-day trial. Rose told the court she conducted all the required tests during Vinnie's eye examination at the Ipswich branch of Boots on 15 February 2012. But the prosecution claimed her conduct had been so far below the expected standard it was \"criminal\". Read this and more stories from Suffolk During the trial the jury heard there were \"obvious abnormalities\" in both of Vinnie's eyes visible during the examination. Photographs taken by another staff member of the back of his eyes shortly before he was examined by Rose suggested he had bilateral papilloedema - a condition in which optic discs at the back of each eye become swollen because of raised pressure within the skull. Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting, said this \"would have been obvious to any competent optometrist\" and should have led to an urgent referral to treat \"a life-threatening condition\". A build-up of fluid in his brain increased pressure in Vinnie's skull and ultimately led to his death. Rose had claimed her examination of Vinnie was tricky because he had closed his eyes to the light and looked away during the test. Jurors took just over two hours with their deliberations to find Rose guilty. The Barker family said in a statement: \"The outcome of this case does not change our life sentence; we will never be able to fully accept that our special little boy is never coming home. \"The decision of a jury or judge cannot bring Vinnie back or undo the devastation of his death. \"A guilty verdict would never make us winners, our loss is simply too great.\" Det Supt Tonya Antonis from Suffolk Police said: \"If this case makes the optometry profession reflect on their practices and review their policies to prevent it happening to anyone again, or encourages other parents to take their children to get their eyes tested with the knowledge that any serious issues would be picked up, then it will be worthwhile.\" The Association of Optometrists said the case was the first of its kind in the UK.

Nearly half a million are living in besieged areas. What is needed is a genuine and sustained effort to alleviate that suffering. At the moment, that is just not happening. Take the relief operation in Madaya. It took literally months to negotiate. From the start, the aid to Madaya, in the south, was linked to the delivery of aid to two towns in the north of the country, Foua and Kefraya. Whereas Madaya is besieged by pro-Syrian government forces, Foua and Kefraya - which are suffering just as much as Madaya - are besieged by opposition groups. One town could not be given relief without relief going to the others - and at exactly the same time. This system was so strictly followed that when one truck literally got stuck in the mud in the north, the trucks in the south could not move until it was freed. No food could be delivered to one town until it was shown - via photos on WhatsApp - that the same food was being delivered to the other side. Aid by synchronisation. This is not the way to run relief operations. Back in Madaya, I was taken to what was euphemistically called the \"health centre\". It was, in fact, one room in the basement of a house. Ushered into the semi-darkness, I was met by the sight of limp bodies lying on blue blankets on the floor: elderly people, weak from hunger and illness. There were several children, hollow-faced. I noticed the needle marks on their arms where drips had been administered to try to give them the sustenance they needed to survive. The doctor, in a bloodied white coat, took me to the one and only bed. It had two occupants. One was a young woman on the verge of giving birth, but she had been drifting in and out of consciousness for the past four days. The second was an eight-year-old girl, unable to speak and move. She was too weak. There was silence. Then, next to me, the doctor started to cry. Peace talks come and go. And still the killing goes on. All sides have been using what can only be termed \"siege warfare\", like something from the Middle Ages, where one side tries to starve the other into submission. As ever, it is the ordinary citizen who suffers. So as humanitarian workers, what should we do? Yes, we can talk about how all sides should respect \"international humanitarian law\" - I mean respect civilians, do not attack hospitals, respect the dignity of the detainee. Yes, we can talk about the need for \"access\"; allow humanitarian workers into areas to help the hungry, the ill and the wounded. But what do we mean in practice? Let the humanitarian workers do their jobs. If an eight-year-old girl needs food, give it to her. If a 70-year-old man needs medical care, give it to him. Do not put lives at risk because a truck is stuck in mud, or one food parcel is not exactly the same as another. Speed up negotiations wherever possible; this can save lives. And let us return, again and again to these places, so that we can continue to provide assistance. Be humane. Keep your humanity. Even under the greatest strains of war. In Madaya, there was another moment that moved me. A woman came up to me and, despite everything, and knowing her plight was far from over, she was smiling. I presumed she was just happy because we had brought the aid in. I was wrong. She lent forward and whispered to me: 'You know what you have done, you people who have come here from the outside? By talking to us, by remembering us, you brought us back something else: our dignity. Thank you.\"", "question": "A cold rain was falling as the men carried the small bundle towards me .

{"id": 1345, "article": "The move to limit Airbnb hosts from renting properties for more than 90 days was announced in December. London boroughs have warned that short-term lets are pushing up longer term rental prices in the capital. But nearly a third of all boroughs told the BBC the time limit would not slow the growth of short-term letting. Airbnb, an accommodation listing website, said the impact of short-term lets and home-sharing websites on rental prices in London was \"negligible\". Last year, it commissioned the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) to investigate the impact of short-term lets on London's rental market . Airbnb said the IPPR report found \"entire homes\" booked on the site at least once a year made up less than 1% of total private housing stock in London in 2015. But the study also showed 11% (2,444 properties) of Airbnb's entire home rentals were let for more than six months of the year. The IPPR found landlords were, in some cases, removing properties from the long-term rental market altogether and offering their properties for rent on a series of short-term lets instead. In turn, this piled pressure on long-term rental prices due to a lack of available properties, the report said. It also found some Airbnb hosts may have been offering properties for rent illegally. Events organiser Daniel Thomas has been looking for an affordable room to rent in the area for over a year. Mr Thomas, who commutes from Slough to Ladbroke Grove, said: \"Lots of young people here are looking for properties for the first time, and they're all just going to tourists, so we have nowhere to live.\" The law states owners cannot let property for more than 90 days in a given year on a short-term let. If an owner wants to let for longer, they must seek planning permission for a \"change of use\" from their local council. Seven London boroughs - Camden, Hammersmith, Haringey, Islington, Lewisham, Waltham Forest, Westminster - have now called for tougher legislation to prevent illegal lettings. A Camden Council spokesman said: \"There is a clear justification for doing so given the detrimental impact short-term letting is having on housing availability in London.\" Diarmard Ward, executive member for housing at Islington Council said: \"Airbnb and other short-term letting sites push up rents and they also reduce the number of homes for people who want to rent long term.\" Airbnb's northern Europe boss, James McClure, told BBC London the company was introducing the 90-day limit \"to forestall any potential danger down the road\". \"That's why we're looking to implement automatic limiting to ensure the law is respected and it's up to councils to decide the best use and mix of properties in their area,\" he added. The Department for Communities and Local Government said any landlord breaching the 90-day limit \"faces a hefty fine\", and added it is up to local councils to enforce the law. A government spokesman praised Airbnb's policy and encouraged other services to follow suit. But commercial landlords operating on Airbnb told BBC London the 90-day limit would have no effect. One, who has three homes listed on the site but did not want to be named, said: \"I'll just carry on as before. When the 90 day rule comes up, I'll re-register the homes I have so it looks like they're different homes... a few metres away. \"I know many other landlords planning to do the same thing.\" Another, Bulent Boytorun, who rents four homes on Airbnb, said he may move his business to alternative home-sharing platforms. All 33 of London's boroughs, including the City of London, were asked whether they believed all home-sharing websites should block illegal lets. Twelve of the 28 the councils that responded to BBC London said they supported it. But when BBC London asked other competitors in the short-term letting market sites if they enforced the 90-day rule or planned to do so, none said they did. A spokesperson for TripAdvisorRentals, which lists about 8,000 London properties, said: \"To list on our site, homeowners and managers must agree to our terms and conditions, which require a property to be operated in accordance with all local laws and regulations.\"", "question": "Attempts by Airbnb to crackdown on rogue landlords using its site have little chance of @placeholder , London councils have told the BBC .", "option_0": "succeeding", "option_1": "results", "option_2": "effect", "option_3": "occurring", "option_4": "concerns"}

{"id": 1348, "article": "We've had three years in which insufficient numbers of homes have come on to the market, and too few are being built to meet projected growth in demand. The latest from the surveyors at Rics is that insufficient numbers are entering the market as buyers. The best that can be said is that prices have sort of stabilised. That report is the latest in a long run of flashing lights in the Scottish economic cockpit. We sometimes complain there is not enough statistical data to know what's going on out there. But when almost all of the numbers are telling a similar story, and it's not a good one, then perhaps it's time to pay more attention. Immediately before Rics, it was the recruitment agency survey from Markit data specialists (the monthly one formerly sponsored by Bank of Scotland). There's growth in the number of job starts, but very little. More significant is that, despite redundancies from the offshore sector, skill shortages are becoming clearer, so starting pay is rising. The problem looks most severe in hotels and catering. A chat with the proprietor of my favourite curry shop this week brought news that the market for chefs is tightening again, due to visa restrictions. Why not train up people you recruit locally? They are unrealistic about the pay they can expect, I was told. If that sounds like exploitation of an inbound Indian, then it's the price paid to keep your lamb pasanda below ?¡ê10. He may have to cut out his curry carry out service due to that lack of capacity. Forget all the economic academic abstractions - that is a real life example of the economy contracting. Before that, it was the turn of the Royal Bank of Scotland's regional tracker. It takes us back to the last quarter of last year, to show that there was 0.7% growth in Scotland's higher quality jobs. Their growth outweighed the loss of low-skilled jobs, which were down 2% in the year. But Scotland's job performance last year was the worst of any nation or region. And it's not all because of London and the south-east surging ahead in its property bubble. Only two regions - East Midlands and Yorkshire with Humberside - shared with Scotland in falling lower-skill jobs. In creating high-skill jobs, Scotland was also ranked poorly, with 1.7% growth. Yorkshire with Humberside had growth of 6.2% in that vital element for sustained growth. North-west England was up 5.6% on higher skill roles. Also at the start of the week, we were told that business optimism has fallen below the long-term trend for growth. That's according to a report from the Centre for Economic and Business Research, commissioned by BDO business consultancy. It draws on the big UK surveys carried out by others, though without many reliable specifics about Scotland. Business optimism and output fell, it found, due to a lack of direction in the economy. According to Martin Gill, head of BDO in Scotland: \"The reduction in output and optimism cannot just be put down to uncertainty due to the EU referendum and may have some more deep rooted causes.\" He doesn't say which causes, preferring to talk symptoms: \"We need to see greater investment and higher productivity to improve capacity, encourage growth and ultimately drive up living standards. \"If businesses don't foresee growth and a more optimistic outlook in the next few months, then we could be in for a bumpy ride this autumn.\" From the Bank of Scotland came a report on oil and gas, showing that a third of firms intended (at the start of this year) to keep cutting jobs through 2016. More than half of Scottish firms in the sector reported a severe or quite bad impact from the oil price downturn. And for all the hopes that business leaders will turn their attention to exports, this sector - with notable successes in exports over recent years - appeared to be pulling back on its interest in expansion overseas. Scottish Engineering, representing the sector, last week put out its regular membership survey. The headline offered reassurance that things were \"holding steady\". On closer inspection, what it meant was that the signs of decline were steadily continuing. Among smaller engineering firms, order intake was up for 28% of those responding, and down for 44%. Medium sized companies were also clearly tipped to the negative. And output volumes were showing similar margins. Said chief executive Bryan Buchan: \"Our sector is suffering from stagnation... We appear to be marking time in terms of capital investment\". He blames the oil and gas downturn, of course, along with a global slowdown and uncertainty from that EU referendum. At the start of this week, there was the Scottish Item Club of economists, hosted by business consultancy EY. (Item is the Independent Treasury Economic Model - that is, a reputable model of the economy developed at the Treasury, with numbers independently applied by economists.) It's in the forecasting business, which can be dismissed as a mug's game. It's almost always wrong. But what it can show us is a direction of travel. So after cutting its forecast for 2016 Scottish output growth last November to 1.9%, it has looked again at the evidence and concluded that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth over this calendar year now looks like 1.2%. The oil gloom continues, and construction is running out of steam. \"GDP is becalmed,\" it headlines. In the second half of last year, it rose only 0.1%, and it was only positive because construction has been performing a lot better than manufacturing and services. \"The fallout from the oil bust appears to be percolating across the Scottish economy,\" it says. \"As a result of the overall malaise, the buoyancy of the labour market has faded, while survey results point to sluggish growth at best.\" The most positive news the Scottish Item Club can offer is that consumer spending is holding things together, as government retreats, business investment stalls and exports struggle. Consumers are helped by low interest rates and a modest rise in real earnings. But a lot of their spending is on top of very high household debt. Some think it unsustainably high. That's while the British economy is on track to reach 2.3% growth. A smaller but still significant gap is expected to continue into 2017 (with Scottish growth up to 2%) and again the year after. And that gap is most glaring in the unemployment figures. As I've noted before, Scotland's unemployment rate has stuck above 6%, clearly above the UK as a whole. Job creation has been poor in Scotland, while the southern neighbours have been churning out new jobs at a rate that's been startling economists. If it weren't for a large number of Scots leaving the workforce last year, for unclear reasons, the unemployment figures could now be heading sharply upwards. We'll get another update next week from the Office for National Statistics. It's not been relentlessly grim.  The annual EY report on inward investment and the attractiveness of the UK's nations and regions recently showed Scotland performing very well, relative to most others. That is as the market for attracting Foreign Direct Investment has changed, and projects are typically smaller. While heaping praise on Scotland for attracting software projects and business services, the EY report came with warnings not to rest on its laurels; manufacturing projects are not coming to Scotland, and the \"Northern Powerhouse\" policy from Whitehall, to boost the north of England, is making it a tougher competitor. While Scotland is good at attracting investment from the well-travelled trade routes across the Atlantic, it is not so good at getting existing foreign investors to expand, and it needs to do more to attract Chinese and Indian investors. Finally, there is the hotel trade. The latest from BDO's survey of activity is a reminder that, for all the new capacity added in Aberdeen in recent years, occupancy and rates have tanked. The rest of the country has been doing very well, however, and it has been sustained for around five years. As we can see around us at the BBC office in Glasgow, the hopes of building a \"digital quarter\" have been re-directed towards hospitality (though we're still a long way from a decent pub). To all this last week, the Scottish Parliament noted that the economy remains \"resilient\".  Technically, that's true. It's not in recession, but it's a close run thing. And if all this survey material is the equivalent of kicking the economy's tyres, its resilience doesn't feel, well, very resilient. Someone else who has been watching the negative data pile up has been Jeremy Peat, visiting professor at Strathclyde University and former chief economist in RBS's heyday. He wrote in The Herald this week that this needs urgent attention and a lot of focus from the Scottish government. He urged those in St Andrew's House not to expend their energy on the minutiae of tax planning and block grant calculation at the expense of figuring out how to get the economy growing. He proposed that the new finance role, with Derek Mackay as cabinet secretary, needs to vet spending plans for their impact on growth as much as their contribution to re-distribution and equality. He wants parliament to beef up its role in scrutinising and supporting economic growth, and particularly the committees. And Prof Peat wants to see outside bodies getting involved - not just stronger university input to policy, but from the business and trade bodies. Of course, outsiders can pile in with their expertise. They can call for serious analysis, and evidence-based policy. The test is of those in a position to do something about all this.

{"id": 1351, "article": "I include in that the anti-Americanism that surrounded the invasion of Iraq and the trauma of the financial crash. Dispirited. Back in 2004 and 2008 Americans were by and large united, or at the very least they were not so angrily divided. One might think that the sight of swastikas on American streets would indeed unite the country in unwavering purpose. Not so. The country is so mired in political division that even Nazi symbols have become political symbols some can live with if they feel that condemning them would give succour to their opposition. And the man running the country is actively widening that divide. There's little point parsing the rationale of President Trump's defence yesterday of the \"fine people\" who took part in the white supremacist march in Charlottesville. I doubt he himself was even trying to make a reasoned case. I suspect that rant of a press conference was driven more by his sense of personal grievance - his anger at being attacked over his initial response to Charlottesville - than by his views on race. But Mr Trump's failure to unambiguously and repeatedly condemn those far-right, racist groups gives them oxygen and strikes a blow at the heart of American identity. American prides itself on being centrist, on not having the European tendency of flirting with extremist groups. Respected veteran political commentators have often told me that the US always gravitates to the centre ground. It sure didn't look like that in Charlottesville - ask Germany, or Italy, or Spain. And if America is going to become just another country, albeit with a lot more weapons, no wonder the world is revising its opinion. Dismissive. The degree to which Americans talk about themselves as a special, unique country has often struck me as a little grandiose. You don't hear the French, or Brits, or Australians talk about themselves that way - though they may well feel it. But perhaps it takes the loss of that uniqueness to make us realise how real it was and how much the world relied on it. This summer I spent time in the UK, France and Spain. In all three countries, leaders are trying to figure out how to get by without American leadership on critical issues like climate change and trade, while the general publics increasingly see the US as a non-entity. It's not even seen as a joke, people are saddened by America's diminished global status. Europeans have long had a complicated and somewhat insecure relationship with the US, part admiration, part jealousy, part irritation. But this year the reaction in Europe to America felt different. Continental Europe is feeling more confident, the economy is doing better and far-right groups have been defeated at the ballot box. Even Britain's decision to withdraw from the EU doesn't get much attention - Brexit is old news in France and Germany. That newfound confidence, mixed with America's clear dysfunction, does indeed create a sense of dismissiveness. For many Europeans, indeed many foreigners, Trump is a spectacle, a reality show on steroids. But that's about the sum of Europe's interest in America right now. Mr Trump's approval ratings are slipping fast. The overwhelming majority of Americans are appalled by all that the hideous scenes in Charlottesville represent. Nothing is getting done in Congress.

Barenboim launched the instrument at London's Royal Festival Hall, in advance of his Schubert recital series. He intends to perform the entire series on the new piano. Modern pianos have become highly standardized, with few changes to their fundamental design over the last 100 years. They are largely cross-strung, with the bass strings crossing over the middle and treble strings in an \"x\" pattern, allowing the sound to be concentrated on the centre of the soundboard. Barenboim was inspired to experiment with the design after playing Franz Liszt's restored grand piano during a trip to Siena, Italy in September 2011. \"The warmth and tonal characteristics of the traditional straight-strung instruments is so different from the homogenous tone produced by the modern piano across its entire range,\" he said. \"The clearly distinguishable voices and colour across its registers of Liszt's piano inspired me to explore the possibility of combining these qualities with the power, looks, evenness of touch, stability of tuning and other technical advantages of the modern piano.\" He developed his idea with Belgian instrument maker Chris Maene, with support from Steinway & Sons. As well as the straight strings, the Barenboim-Maene piano features a double bridge and horizontal soundboard veins.

Dodds was a PC with Durham Police from 1993 until 2007 when he was dismissed for conduct reasons, a force spokeswoman said. From February to November 1998 he was a member of the armed protection team based at Mirabella, the constituency home of the then Prime Minister and Sedgefield MP Tony Blair.

{"id": 1366, "article": "The public was included in the choice of nominations for the honour of appearing on the next ¡ê20 note, to enter circulation in 2020. As with the new ¡ê5 and ¡ê10 notes from the Bank of England, being introduced this year and next, the ¡ê20 note will be made of plastic. This extends a rich history of changing currency in the UK and worldwide. The plastic notes - starting with the new ¡ê5 note featuring Sir Winston Churchill due to be issued in September - will eventually replace cotton paper notes, which have been used for more than 100 years. In many ways, this is a significant change in the way money is produced, not least because a Bank of England banknote will survive a spin in the washing machine for the first time. However, there are many other revolutionary developments in the way money has been made over many centuries. Ben Alsop, curator of the Citi Money Gallery at the British Museum, and Mieka Harris, education manager for the gallery, offer a snapshot of this rich history - with the help of five objects from the gallery's collection. This coin made from electrum - a natural alloy of gold and silver found in riverbeds - is one of the earliest examples of coins, and the beginnings of the Western tradition of coinage that is still going strong. It was minted in Lydia, in modern day western Turkey, in the 7th Century BC, making it more than 2,500 years old. These coins, featuring a lion's head, were of a consistent weight and purity. As a result, they held a value that allowed them to be used in cross-border trade - replacing the idea of two commodities effectively being swapped between traders. The tiny coin was of significant value, so was used in high-level trade, as gifts between rulers, and as payment to mercenary soldiers. The vast majority of the population would never see one, and continued to trade without coins - as had been the case for cities and empires for more than 2,000 years. Bartering, for example, still ran in parallel with trading using coins. Throughout history, coins have looked very different to the money we recognise today. This hollow-handled spade money was used in China in the early 6th Century BC, when the country was made up of a number of separate states In order to inspire confidence among the merchant classes to use this abstract concept of bronze money, it was shaped as an agricultural tool - an item recognised by these people, rather than an alien, round coin. Coins shaped as knives were also produced in China around 200 years later, as this was a shape recognised by those involved in warfare. Weight was much more important that shape in terms of value. Although its use was more widespread than the Lydian coins, the use of coins as currency did not filter down to the population at large until Roman times. The earliest banknote in the British Museum's collection is this grandly named Great Ming circulating treasure note from the 14th Century. It is an early example of \"paper\" money carrying a value. In this case, the one guan note is worth 1,000 coins, as can be seen from the illustration on the 34cm by 22cm note. It is actually made of mulberry bark. \"People started to call it 'flying cash', partly because of its convenience across high-level trade, but also because it no longer had the weight to it that coins would have had,\" says Ms Harris. \"So if you were not holding it properly, it could potentially fly away.\" Backed by the central authority, it also features a border of dragons, and an inscription that warns against counterfeiting. The warning seems to have been ignored. Owing to counterfeits and inflation - which rose as printing money became easier - China stopped issuing paper notes in the early 15th Century and did not start again until the 19th Century. When the British Isles were gripped by civil war in the 17th Century, there was huge instability and a lack of small denomination currency. Small traders and other establishments stepped in when the central authority was unable to provide this coinage, by issuing their own tokens. This 17th Century token was issued, according to the inscription, by John Ewing, who traded near St George's Church in Southwark. He was a tobacconist, hence the image of a monkey smoking a pipe. Customers could use this token in his store, but other local traders may have accepted it, too. This private production of money was in many ways a forerunner to local currencies seen today such as the Brixton Pound and the Bristol Pound, as well as cryptocurrencies or digital currency such as Bitcoin. However, these tokens were not used for long. A Royal proclamation, following the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, clamped down on their production. Although money is inherently conservative in nature in order to be accepted by the general population, there have been some revolutionary developments. One was the birth of the credit card, even though credit and debt have existed for as long as money itself. This particular card is an early example from the US, from the 1960s. Credit accounts were already common in individual stores, but credit cards allowed people to use one card to shop on credit across the numerous stores and not have to carry notes and coins. \"To get people using them, they were mailed out to people who had not asked for them, just to try to encourage people to use this new form of payment,\" says Mr Alsop. This was not particularly scientific, so there were examples of credit cards being sent to toddlers. There was no automation in the credit card, as is the case today, so shoppers would hand over the card to a shopkeeper who would make a telephone call to a bank. That bank would then check with the shopper's bank by phone and eventually the transaction would be authorised.", "question": "Debate has begun over the choice of JMW Turner to be @placeholder on a Bank of England banknote .", "option_0": "imposed", "option_1": "commemorated", "option_2": "blamed", "option_3": "included", "option_4": "lost"}

His move comes after Helen Boaden's retirement as director of radio. The BBC said a new director of radio would be recruited to \"give creative leadership and focus day in, day out\". Tony Hall, the BBC's director general, said he wanted \"to bring together network radio, arts, music, learning and children's under James's leadership\". Purnell, who joined the BBC in 2010, said he was \"delighted to have been asked to lead the new division\". Lord Patten of Barnes, former chairman of the BBC Trust, said Purnell had \"huge experience in public affairs and now in broadcasting\". \"I am sure he will do an excellent job running some of the BBC's flagship services,\" the former Conservative minister continued. Rumours of Purnell's new role began circulating earlier this year, prompting former Culture Secretary John Whittingdale to call for a rethink. The Conservative MP said he had \"concerns about somebody who has played a very prominent role in a political party then going on to have an editorial job in the BBC\". The BBC said Purnell was interviewed for the new post earlier this week and would remain on his existing ?¡ê295,000 salary. Boaden, 60, joined the BBC in 1983, going on to become head of BBC News in 2004 and director of Radio in 2013. She will leave the corporation in March to take up a fellowship at Harvard and said she had been \"very fortunate to have done some wonderfully challenging and fascinating jobs throughout my long career\".

And with a click, you can re-order your dishwashing detergent from the e-retailer and it will arrive on your doorstep along with your other purchases. Connecting things wirelessly to the internet is termed the Internet of Things (IoT). I recently made a programme about what is being hyped as the next big thing in tech. The reason is because of the numbers involved. Imagine your household gadgets, smart meters, and other objects are all connected to the internet. For instance, wearable technology such as fitness bands that track your daily activities are recorded online (and tell you that you need to sleep more). Driverless cars are another example. Thinking about how many gadgets there are in the world, it's not surprising that the IoT is being viewed with such excitement. ABI Research estimates that there are already more than 16bn wireless connected devices, an increase of 20% from a year earlier. By 2020, Gartner forecasts that the market will generate incremental revenue of more than $300bn. No wonder Amazon wants a slice. The company is known for making virtually no profits despite strong revenues and a sizeable market share. For instance, Amazon has a dominant share of the e-book market and is one of the top 10 retailers in the United States, largely due to its low prices and undercutting bricks and mortar competitors. Last year, Amazon posted a loss of $241m despite revenues of $89bn. For years, its revenues and profits have been headed in opposite directions. From 2007, Amazon's revenues surged from $15bn, but profits steadily fell from $436m to a loss now. Its share price fell by about 20% last year but has since recovered some ground. However, analysts are wondering how long investors will support a minimally profitable business. Founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos is an active experimenter, trying everything from drones to make customer deliveries, to gadgets such as the Kindle and Fire smartphone. Some have been successful, but many have not. Mr Bezos will be banking on IoT being the next big thing and not just hype, and that his foray will pay off.", "question": "Amazon is known for wanting to provide everything that you buy and it s @placeholder foray aims to do just that .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "appointed", "option_2": "major", "option_3": "latest", "option_4": "personal"}

TalkTalk said it had sent the email to every customer although only a few thousand account numbers went astray. It has set up a dedicated phone line for customers targeted by the scammers. The theft of data was unearthed when TalkTalk investigated a sudden rise in complaints from customers about scam calls between October and December 2014, said a spokeswoman. \"We have now concluded a thorough investigation working with an external security company, and we have become aware that some limited non-sensitive information may have been illegally accessed in violation of our security procedure,\" she said. The attackers got at some of TalkTalk's internal systems via a third-party that also had access to its network. Legal action is now being taken against this unnamed third party. The information stolen included names, addresses, phone numbers and TalkTalk account numbers. The company was confident that no sensitive or payment data went astray in the hack. \"We are aware of a small, but nonetheless significant, number of customers who have been directly targeted by these criminals and we have been supporting them directly,\" said a statement from TalkTalk.  It would not put an exact figure on the number affected but said it was in the \"small thousands\". The company currently has about four million customers. The scammers appear to be using the stolen details to trick people into thinking calls are coming from legitimate TalkTalk customer service staff. People are then tricked into handing over bank details or into signing up and paying for security software and services they do not need. Although TalkTalk said it became aware of the data loss late last year, the BBC has been contacted by one customer who said the scammers working to a similar pattern called in August. His wife's familiarity with computers helped her quickly spot that the call was fake. \"They said our computer was infected with a virus and used various social engineering techniques to try to get more info, but she's pretty clued up,\" said Richard Lee-Williams from Wales. \"Over the following few days she got several more calls but from a different person each time trying the same trick,\" he said. At the time TalkTalk was \"dismissive\" of the complaint Mr Lee-Williams made about the scam. A TalKTalk spokeswoman said without more details it was hard to know if the same conmen were involved in the August and December attacks.

The trust is launching a consultation on tackling \"nature deficit disorder\". \"This is about changing the way children grow up and see the world,\" said Stephen Moss, the author, naturalist and former BBC Springwatch producer who wrote the Natural Childhood report for the National Trust. \"The natural world doesn't come with an instruction leaflet, so it teaches you to use your creative imagination. \"When you build a den with your mates when you're nine years old, you learn teamwork - you disagree with each other, you have arguments, you resolve them, you work together again - it's like a team-building course, only you did it when you were nine.\" The trust argues, as have other bodies in previous years, that the growing dissociation of children from the natural world and internment in the \"cotton wool culture\" of indoor parental guidance impairs their capacity to learn through experience. It cites evidence showing that: Yet British parents feel more pressure to provide gadgets for their children than in other European countries. The phrase nature deficit disorder was coined in 2005 by author Richard Louv, who argued that the human cost of \"alienation from nature\" was measured in \"diminished use of the senses, attention difficulties and higher rates of physical and emotional illnesses\". In the UK as in many other countries, rates of obesity, self-harm and mental health disorders diagnosed in children have climbed significantly since the 1970s. But nature deficit disorder is not generally regarded as a medical condition. \"There's undoubtedly a phenomenon that's not good for health, which is about not giving access to outdoors or green space, safe risk-taking and so on,\" said David Pencheon, a medical doctor who now heads the National Health Service's sustainable development unit. \"But I wouldn't say we've identified a medical condition. \"In fact we don't want to 'medicalise' it, we should see it as part of everyday life - if you medicalise it, people say 'you'd better go to your doctor and take a pill'.\" But despite growing recognition of nature deficit disorder, policies aiming to tackle it appear thin on the ground. Mr Moss cites statistics showing that the area where children are allowed to range unsupervised around their homes has shrunk by 90% since the 1970s. Whereas some reasons behind the parental \"cotton wool culture\" are not based in logic - most sexual molestation occurs in the home, for example, not in parks - the one \"genuine massive danger\" is traffic. \"I think the first step for any child is playing outdoors in the street; and in the 40 years since I grew up, traffic has increased hugely, and that's the main reason why none of us let our kids out on their own,\" Mr Moss told BBC News. \"The only solution would be to have pedestrian priority on every residential street in Britain; when you are driving along the street, if there are children playing, they have priority.\" The report advocates having teachers take children for lessons outdoors when possible, with urban schools using parks. It also says that authorities who cite \"health and safety\" as a reason for stopping children playing conkers or climbing trees should be aware that successive Health and Safety Executive heads have advocated a measure of risk-taking in children's lives. The changes in childhood in previous decades are now filtering through into adulthood, where levels of obesity are also rising. Dr Pencheon observed that although doctors are beginning to prescribe exercise instead of drugs where it is indicated, much more could be done from a policy perspective. \"One of the problems here is that the NHS is not incentivised financially to do public health,\" he said. \"The healthcare system is run on a rescue basis - people come to us when they're ill, we patch them up and try to get them going again - that's not the culture of a system designed to keep people healthy.\" The National Trust is now beginning a two-month consultation aimed at gathering views and examples of good and bad practice from the public and specialists. These will eventually be turned into a set of policy recommendations. \"As a nation, we need to do everything we can to make it easy and safe for our children to get outdoors,\" said National Trust director-general Fiona Reynolds. \"We want to move the debate on and encourage people and organisations to think about how we take practical steps to reconnect children with the natural world and inspire them to get outdoors.\" Follow Richardon Twitter", "question": "UK children are losing contact with nature at a \" dramatic \" rate , and their health and education are @placeholder , a National Trust report says .", "option_0": "predicting", "option_1": "implemented", "option_2": "services", "option_3": "settled", "option_4": "suffering"}

The report was produced from the joint findings of HM Inspectorate of Probation and the Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales. Local authorities are responsible for providing accommodation for homeless young people of that age, and the report said many had already been in the care system. Inspectors found: Inspectors said some of the reasons for the failures appeared to be inadequate assessment, a limited range of suitable accommodation, a lack of understanding of each child's needs and treating them as if they were adults. They added that none of the local authorities they spoke to blamed failures on a lack of funding. All the 16 and 17-year-olds whose cases were examined by probation and social care inspectors had experienced some sort of trauma in their earlier life and, the inspectors said, had often often demonstrated \"difficult behaviour\". Crucially, the report concluded that these children were \"not yet capable of independence and still needed some form of parenting or support\". The report said local authorities \"should avoid\" placing youngsters in accommodation with adults who may pose a risk of harm to them, and youth offending teams should work together to improve the support for these children - including tailoring their support to the needs of each child. \"The wider support children received was sometimes excellent but in other cases, woefully inadequate,\" Dame Glenys said. \"Support for these children needs to be more consistent, effective and in line with the expectations set by the courts, so that they can successfully become independent adults.\" A government spokesperson said: \"The law is clear that children's services must protect any child without a home and give them the support they need - and this age group is no exception. \"The number of 16 and 17-year-olds being placed in bed and breakfast accommodation has fallen but we know there is more to do. \"That is why we are investing over ?¡ê500m to tackle homelessness and are collecting data on all children who go missing from care.

{"id": 1419, "article": "In Northern Ireland, learning a second language is not a statutory part of the primary school curriculum. In England and Scotland, by contrast, primary school pupils are expected to learn a foreign language. The review of primary languages in Northern Ireland has been carried out by researchers from Stranmillis University College. The authors surveyed language learning at over 100 schools. They found that Spanish and French were most popular in schools where languages were taught. Some pupils also learned German or Mandarin. However, not all primary schools taught an additional language. This led the authors to conclude that there was \"a lack of equity in provision for children\" across the country. They also found little consistency in how often languages were taught to pupils, and when they began to learn a language. Some primary principals also expressed concerns about the amount of support and resources available to their teachers and pupils. However, the majority of principals and teachers who participated in the study agreed that learning an additional language was important and valuable. But they also said teaching foreign languages was not a priority for schools as it was not assessed or measured. The report's authors said that the development of language skills was \"vital for economic prosperity, social cohesion and the acceptance of diverse cultural identities\". \"It is hoped that the findings of this study may encourage policy makers, business and educational providers to support the revision and improvement of current curriculum provision in additional language learning,\" the report said.

Mr Hughes said Mr Creaney \"wasn't making any noise\" when they washed the injured man and changed his clothes. The victim, from Lurgan, County Armagh, was attacked after he had been drinking with both of the accused at Mr Hughes' home in Moyrafety Court. His wounded body was then carried up the stairs where he was showered and changed twice. Mr Creaney died from his injuries two days later and his remains were then dumped into a green recycling bin. Both Mr Hughes and Ms Boyle, from Edenderry Park in Banbridge, County Down, have said they were not involved in the attack the early hours of Thursday July 3, and have pointed the finger of blame at each other. Giving evidence at Belfast Crown Court for the second day, Mr Hughes again denied he had assaulted Mr Creaney, saying that Ms Boyle had punched, kicked and stamped on the victim in the hallway of his home. Mr Creaney's injuries included a total of 15 fractured ribs and a broken breastbone, as well as bleeding of and tearing to the brain. A prosecuting barrister said being showered and changed twice must have been \"agony\" for the victim, as he had \"several fractured ribs on both sides\". At this point, Mr Hughes said he did notice a bruise on Mr Creaney's chest the second time they changed him. However, he added that Mr Creaney \"wasn't making any noise\" at the time. \"I honestly didn't know he had any broken ribs or anything,\" Mr Hughes told the court. When he was asked about the state of Mr Creaney's face after the attack, the accused said he noticed the victim had \"two black eyes and a wee cut to his lip\" after Ms Boyle had washed him. The prosecution barrister then asked Mr Hughes what he thought was going to happen to Mr Creaney's remains after they were placed in the bin. \"You knew you wanted to put him in the bin.

{"id": 1425, "article": "It hasn't quite happened like that - despite some apocalyptic warnings before the referendum. Today the FTSE 100 is up more than 2% and is now above its level for all of June save referendum day. The FTSE 250 - a better barometer of British business health - is up nearly 2%, though still significantly lower than it was on referendum day, its highest for the year, when many market participants believed Remain would win on 23 June. Government borrowing costs are falling. And sterling has stabilised. So, are investors now comfortable with the decision to leave the EU? Crisis over, so to speak? Many argue that would be a peculiar judgement to make. Markets are built to discover prices, not to make political points. The volatility in the markets in the run-up to the referendum and the fierce falls in its aftermath were clear signals of participants struggling to judge business and currency values given the uncertainty around the UK's economic future. Also, that something markets thought was going to happen - a vote to remain in the EU - did not. Hence a big sell-off and a significant decline in the value of sterling. Big sell-offs present buying opportunities, and are therefore often followed by rises as investors look for bargains. Bears are followed by bulls. Exporting companies are also helped by a weaker currency as their products tend to become more competitive. And for any businesses that earn revenues in dollars - such as some pharmaceutical and oil companies - a decline in sterling is positive for profits. In uncertain times, price discovery can be a tricky business. As UBS's Bill O'Neill said on referendum night, \"markets are a discounting machine and they will overreact first, think later\". Well, they have now had time to think. And many of the signals are rather better than some feared. First, the market system has remained operational. Mark Carney's statement early on Friday morning that the Bank of England stood ready to provide all necessary support maintained investor confidence that liquidity would not dry up. Participants did not simply leave the field of play. Second, as Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Economics told me, it has become clear that Britain is not heading for a \"hard Brexit\". The invoking of Article 50 - which starts the two-year clock ticking on Britain's exit from the EU - may not happen for months. And some big figures - like George Osborne, still of course the Chancellor of the Exchequer - have said that Britain should remain a member of the single market, an important point for many businesses that trade with the rest of the EU. Yes, government borrowing costs are falling. But many argue that is down to a \"flight to safety\" - the purchasing of government debt - rather than a judgement on the future performance of the UK economy. What the relief rally of the past two days is not telling us is that anything fundamental about the economics of Britain's decision to leave the EU has changed. Consensus Digest, which brings together the economic judgements of the major forecasters, suggests that economic growth rates will fall over the rest of 2016 and 2017 as businesses delay investments. We are yet to see much - if any - economic data about what has happened in the real world post the referendum. Of course, that data - released over the next few months and years - may not be as poor as some predict. Or it may be worse. But, once we have some facts, we will at least be able to look through the gyrations of the markets and make a clearer judgement about the effects on the UK, European and global economies of the decision taken on 23 June.", "question": "Surely , by now , stock markets should be through the floor and sterling @placeholder in a gutsy grapple with the Zimbabwean dollar for the crown of least - liked currency on global markets ?", "option_0": "occurred", "option_1": "portrayed", "option_2": "settled", "option_3": "engaged", "option_4": "coincided"}

However, the 29-year-old was made to work harder than at any stage during the series by a defiant South Africa, the world's number one-ranked Test side. They were led by an uncharacteristically defensive display from De Villiers, who holds the records for the fastest fifty, century and 150 in one-day internationals. Between them, Ashwin and India's three other frontline bowlers delivered 136.1 overs, 87 of which were maidens. Ravindra Jadeja took 2-26 off 46 overs, including 17 consecutive maidens, Umesh Yadav claimed 3-9 off 21 and Ishant Sharma conceded only 23 runs from 20 overs. Much of that time was spent trying to dislodge De Villiers, who was unbeaten on 11 overnight and carried on where he left off during a 345-minute stay at the crease. After captain Amla was bowled by a wonderful delivery from Jadeja that turned to hit off stump, De Villiers was assisted by Faf du Plessis, who took 53 balls to score his first run and had made 10 from 117 when he was lbw to the slow left-armer. De Villiers lost JP Duminy before tea - lbw to Ashwin without scoring - and Dane Vilas after the interval, bowled by Yadav for 13 off 57 deliveries. The crucial breakthrough, though, came moments later when Ashwin found turn and bounce to have De Villiers taken at leg slip off his glove. It was the second wicket to fall in the space of 27 balls as India ran through the tail, Ashwin sealing victory by bowling Morne Morkel.", "question": "India overcame @placeholder resistance from South Africa to win the fourth and final Test in Delhi by 337 runs and seal a 3 - 0 series victory .", "option_0": "strong", "option_1": "needed", "option_2": "stubborn", "option_3": "classic", "option_4": "lost"}

His supporters threw stones and opened fire when police tried to raid his ashram in the northern state of Haryana. The bodies of four women and a child were subsequently found at the site. A fifth woman, aged 20, died at a local hospital after leaving the ashram. The causes of their deaths have not been revealed. Police say the bodies did not \"bear any injuries\". The guru was led out of the complex in an ambulance late on Wednesday, as dozens of local villagers cheered the police. He has been taken to the state capital, Chandigarh, a senior police official told the BBC. He is likely to appear in court on Thursday. A week-long stand-off at the Satlok Ashram - some 170km (105 miles) north-east of Delhi - escalated on Tuesday as police moved in to arrest Rampal. Police fired tear gas and water cannon, and used bulldozers to try to break into the sprawling complex, while ashram members threw stones and other missiles and opened fire. Hundreds of people were hurt in the operation. Police accuse the guru's armed devotees of holding people hostage, and using women and children as human shields. At least 270 people have been arrested in connection with Tuesday's clashes and charged with rioting, illegal detention, attempt to murder and waging war against the state. The authorities also cut off power and water supplies to the site. Mani Ram, a devotee who managed to escape, told the Indian Express newspaper that ashram authorities had prevented them from leaving for two days, insisting police would kill them if they went outside. Rampal is accused of involvement in a murder case dating from 2006 in which a man died in a clash at another of his ashrams. He denied the allegations and was released on bail. The authorities ordered his arrest on contempt charges after he repeatedly failed to appear in court. The Punjab and Haryana High Court had set a final deadline for Rampal to appear in court on Monday in the contempt case.

{"id": 1442, "article": "There is no other forum where top-level US officials find themselves face-to-face with their North Korean counterparts. The annual Asean Regional Forum (ARF) brings together 27 countries from the Asia Pacific region, and offers opportunities for all kinds of useful bilateral conversations, given the presence of foreign ministers from China, Russia, Japan and the US. But it is the chance of face-to-face meetings with the North Korean foreign minister which raises the most tantalising possibilities. Arranging any other North Korean-US meeting is a complex business, involving a huge amount of negotiation over the protocol, agenda and even the meaning of such a meeting. They rarely happen. But at the ARF in Manila, Rex Tillerson, the US secretary of state, will be sitting in the same room as his North Korean counterpart. Will they chat? Shake hands? Ignore each other? Given the high stakes, journalists will watch eagerly to try to interpret any contact at all between the two sides. It brings to mind a previous ARF summit, which I attended in Brunei in July 2002. At the time US-North Korean tension had also escalated sharply. President George W Bush harboured an intense dislike for the brutalities of the North Korean regime. Hardliners in his administration believed he should stand up to such regimes, not negotiate with them. In the post 9/11 climate, Mr Bush was inclined to divide the world into friends and enemies of the US. And his intelligence services had uncovered evidence that North Korea was cheating on its commitment, agreed under President Bill Clinton, not to develop its embryonic nuclear weapons programme. There had been no high-level contacts between the two countries since Mr Bush had come to office. The president had just included North Korea in his memorable Axis of Evil speech. North Korea had been admitted to the ARF just two years earlier, at the height of then-South Korean President Kim Dae-jung's  Sunshine Policy of rapprochement towards the North. At that time the deal President Clinton had struck with the North Koreans - to fund a civilian nuclear energy programme for Pyongyang in return for dismantling its plutonium facilities - was still intact. The US had even sent Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Pyongyang in October 2000, to meet Kim Jong-il. But by the time the first North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam-sun was due to attend an ARF summit, the one in Brunei in 2002, relations had already deteriorated. So there was a great deal of speculation over whether Colin Powell, who had replaced Ms Albright as secretary of state, would meet, or even talk to him. Journalists then, as now, were kept in a media centre far from where the senior officials were meeting. A select few photographers and cameramen record the handshakes of the more important participants, but many of the meetings are only confirmed later by officials. By the afternoon of 31 July, news had leaked out - there had been a meeting between Mr Powell and Mr Paek. It dominated headlines from the forum that day. But what had they discussed? A large crowd of us gathered for the briefing given by the State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. Questions about the encounter flew from the floor. He looked a little sheepish, and explained that it was an informal get-together, during a coffee break, which had lasted just 15 minutes. What with protocol and translation, he said, a lot of the time was used up expressing pleasantries. The North Koreans had indicated a willingness to have further high-level talks. Mr Powell had agreed, but said these would need to address some tough issues. And that was it. That was not the full picture. Colin Powell was a moderate within the Bush administration, who believed engaging North Korea, even with some evidence it was not complying with its commitment to freeze its nuclear programme, was the only constructive way forward. He had a room prepared at the ARF for the meeting, and the North Koreans had been alerted by US officials well in advance. He had not informed President Bush of his plan, although he did apparently tell National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who may have passed it on to Mr Bush. The secretary of state had, after conversations with President Bush, come up with what he called a \"Bold Approach\" to re-engaging with North Korea, which would stress the US willingness to help with humanitarian needs in a country still recovering from the devastating famines of the 1990s, while carefully finding ways to rebuild trust over the nuclear programme. That was what he wanted to convey to Mr Paek. In the meeting he stressed that the US did not wish to attack North Korea. As we now know, Colin Powell's impromptu act of diplomacy went nowhere. Hardliners within the Bush administration around Vice-President Dick Cheney were reportedly furious about the meeting. Mistrust over North Korea's nuclear programme persisted. And the US invasion of Iraq may well have convinced the North Koreans that only by obtaining a nuclear weapons capability could they be sure of deterring Mr Bush from attempting regime change in Asia.", "question": "Amid high tensions between the US and North Korea , all eyes are now on a regional forum attended by top envoys from both countries .

{"id": 1443, "article": "Microsoft bought the block-building phenomenon in 2014 for $2.5bn (?¡ê1.8bn) - a huge deal that had fans of the game worried about its future. The US firm promised not to ruin its popular formula, and instead said it would invest in bringing Minecraft to the next level. At an event in San Francisco's trendy Mission District, its Xbox division showed off the virtual reality version of Minecraft for the first time. \"It makes you feel like you're inside the world of Minecraft,\" said Palmer Luckey, creator of the Oculus Rift VR headset. Like many VR experiences, it's utterly absorbing. For those obsessed with Minecraft's addictive building process, it is a big step up from watching it on a normal screen. But for a game popular with children, there's one figure that might worry parents: $1,500. That's the suggested amount they'll need to spend if they want to buy an Oculus Rift headset and a PC powerful enough to power it. That's surely too expensive, I suggested to Mr Luckey. \"It isn't,\" he said. \"I mean, it is expensive relative to everything else out in the world, but if you look at it compared to a mobile phone or television, you're getting a lot more technology. \"It's not like this is simple hardware, and the cost is going to go down over time.\" It'll need to go down pretty sharp-ish if it is to be adopted by mainstream audiences soon. Until then, I'd predict a minor resurgence of the games arcade, a place where people go to play high-end games that they can't feasibly afford to buy for their homes. Minecraft on Oculus was one of several games on display at Xbox's Spring Showcase, a chance for journalists - and a few influential YouTube gamers, naturally - to get hands-on with tomorrow's blockbusters. I lost an hour within the gripping world of Quantum Break. It's a game in which you play Jack Joyce, an unwilling action hero who develops the ability to manipulate time after an experiment gone awry. If that sounds like yet another predictable scenario for a game, you'd be right - but the title's mechanics (think \"bullet time\", only better) make it something special. Also look out for Tom Clancy's The Division - set in a painstakingly true-to-life Manhattan. Many of the titles on show were also being pushed as great to play on PC, via Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system. \"If you look at the numbers, PC gaming is the fastest growing segment of gaming out there,\" said head of Xbox Phil Spencer. \"It's natural that we'd focus on gaming on Windows.\" When it comes to virtual reality, Microsoft has opted not to make its own headset - although it is developing the augmented reality-focused Hololens - but is instead working to make itself compatible with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. On the price debate, Mr Spencer said he believed virtual reality would follow the path of high definition TVs - a luxury item to start with, but hard to resist once experienced. \"The early adopters will be there to help spur the VR industry,\" he said. Given that Sony's PlayStation 4 will be getting its own VR headset, I asked if Microsoft too might consider making its own gear. \"I absolutely think it could be something that is part of our roadmap,\" he said. But he stressed the focus now was entirely on making Windows 10 fully-compatible with high-end VR titles. Of course, new games mean nothing unless gamers can get online to play them. And of late, that's been something of a challenge. Poor reliability on Xbox Live - the service Xbox gamers use to play against each other over the internet - has stressed out thousands. Disgruntled fans include rapper Snoop Dogg, who - in a video too profane to link to here - begged Bill Gates to fix the problem or he'd defect to PlayStation. Mr Spencer apologised for the issues. \"It's obviously always regretful,\" he said. \"This last outage was a concern, we learned from it. We understood exactly what the issue was, it just took a little more time that we would have liked.\" He denied that the company had been the victim of a hack, saying that while its network was under constant attack it was not, as had been claimed, felled by a coordinated effort to cut gamers off. And on the risk of losing Snoop Dogg: \"Snoop's been a long-time gamer and long-time supporter of Xbox. \"I understand when people get upset. I take it as a sign of the love and commitment people have for what we are as a game platform.\" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook", "question": "Minecraft is already @placeholder by millions of gamers around the world - now Microsoft has shown us what the immersive world looks like in virtual reality .", "option_0": "defined", "option_1": "adored", "option_2": "dominated", "option_3": "enjoyed", "option_4": "inspired"}

The problem, he believes, is that the theory came unstuck in practice. Mr Burr now acknowledges that his 2003 manual was \"barking up the wrong tree\". He disclosed his views in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Current guidelines no longer suggest passwords should be frequently changed, because people tend to respond by making only small alterations to their existing passwords - for example, changing \"monkey1\" into \"monkey2\"- which are relatively easy to deduce. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that it takes longer for computers to crack a random mix of words - such as \"pig coffee wandered black\" - than it does for them to guess a word with easy-to-remember substitutions - such as \"br0k3n!\". Mr Burr's original advice was distributed by the US government's National Institute of Standards and Technology. It has since been amended several times, with the most recent edition being released in June. \"Anything published under the Nist banner tends to be influential, so these guidelines have had a long lasting impact,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. \"But we've known for some considerable time that these guidelines actually had a rather unfortunate effect. \"For example, the more often you ask someone to change their password, the weaker the passwords they typically choose. \"And, as we have all now so many online accounts, the situation is compounded so it encourages behaviours such as password reuse across systems.\" Britain's National Cyber Security Centre issued its own guidance on the matter in 2015. It recommended that organisations abandoned a policy of pushing their users into regular password resets, and that they should support the use of password managers - programs that securely store hundreds of different logins, avoiding the need to memorise each one. \"It's good that password advice is now being updated to be based on evidence,\" said Dr Steven Murdoch, from University College London. \"But there is still traditional advice in other areas of computer security being perpetuated despite us knowing it won't work. \"We need research to tell us what security advice will actually improve the situation, and for the government and companies to pay attention to results.\"", "question": "The author of an influential guide to computer passwords says he now @placeholder several of the tips he gave .", "option_0": "managing", "option_1": "remembered", "option_2": "regrets", "option_3": "has", "option_4": "regained"}

{"id": 1449, "article": "In the future, 2016 may be remembered as the year in which Westerners lost faith in the liberal story. It may therefore be remembered as the counterpoint to 1989. In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism, it seemed that the liberal story had won. The liberal story says that humankind is inevitably marching towards a global society of free markets and democratic politics. Those who willingly join the march of history by opening their borders and liberalising their markets and politics will be rewarded with peace and prosperity. Those who refuse to liberalise and globalise are doomed to failure. Bill Clinton, for example, confidently told the Chinese government that its refusal to liberalise Chinese politics put it \"on the wrong side of history\". In the 1990s and 2000s, the liberal story shaped not only the foreign policy of the United States and its allies, but also the domestic policies of governments across the world, from South Africa to Indonesia. However, since the global financial crisis of 2008, people all over the world have become increasingly disillusioned with the liberal story. It is no longer so clear that the Chinese Communist Party is on the wrong side of history, and authoritarian rulers such as Putin, Erdogan and Netanyahu are taking their countries in distinctly illiberal directions. The year 2016 - marked by the Brexit vote in Britain and the rise of Donald Trump in the United States - signifies the moment when this tidal wave of disillusionment has reached the liberal heartland of Western Europe and North America. Whereas a few years ago Americans and Europeans were still trying to liberalise Iraq and Libya at the point of the gun, they now have second thoughts even about American democracy and European identity. More and more Americans and Europeans are convinced that liberalisation and globalisation are a huge fraud that serves the interests of a tiny elite at the expense of the masses. In the long run, however, 2016 may turn out to be similar to 1968, 1933 and 1914. On all these previous occasions, Westerners lost faith in the liberal story only to eventually embrace it again. The people who voted for Hitler and Mussolini eventually built the West German and Italian democracies, and the youngsters who rioted in 1968 eventually went on to become Wall Street traders and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.

Mr McCloy took up the sport in 2006 but his relatives have been involved in pigeon racing for at least three generations. His uncles were founding members of the pigeon club in Cullybackey and he still races under their team name, Reid Brothers and McCloy. His own birds have won several prizes in the all-island Irish National Flying Club championship over the last few years. Mr McCloy said he gets up at about 05:30 every day to care for his pigeons as \"you need to spend time with them to do it right\". He said he has spent years trying to build up his racing stock and feels \"gutted\" that someone came to his family home to steal his birds. \"My racing season is over,\" Mr McCloy told the BBC, saying all his candidates for upcoming races in France had been taken in the burglary. He said he suspects other pigeon fanciers may be responsible and that they must have come prepared, with baskets or carriers to transport the birds. There was no evidence of damage to the loft or any of the birds. Thirty-eight of the 50 birds stolen were racing pigeons, but Mr Mc Cloy said the thieves had also taken stock birds, which were even more valuable. About 30 less expensive pigeons were left behind by the thieves. Mr McCloy said if any of his birds manage to escape from the thieves they will instinctively fly home to him, but he appealed to anyone who knew anything about the theft to contact police.

Turkey says a movement loyal to US-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen organised the July 2016 plot to bring down President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Earlier this month the president won a referendum on boosting his powers. As a result of the narrow victory Mr Erdogan can become head of the executive, beefing up the largely ceremonial role of Turkey's president. \"1,009 covert 'imams' in 72 provinces have been taken into custody so far,\" Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu was reported as saying, calling it an important step for Turkey. A list of 3,224 people had been compiled by police in an operation across Turkey's 81 provinces, reports said. In Istanbul alone, 390 suspects were being sought. It was widely expected that the post-coup purge would accelerate once President Erdogan achieved the victory he wanted in a referendum on expanding his powers. He feels emboldened and there's no longer a risk of jeopardising potential referendum votes. No matter that the opposition still contests the referendum results, their claim of widespread fraud backed by a scathing report from election observers. The president says the result is final and that's that. So on Wednesday the police bore the brunt of the detentions, but other institutions are likely to follow suit. The governing AKP party was full of Gulen supporters when Mr Erdogan and the cleric were staunch allies. It hasn't yet been purged and could now be targeted since the president has got his referendum victory. And even if not, it will be dangled over potential opponents like a sword of Damocles: speak out and your Gulen affiliation will be exposed. Since the coup, in which 249 people died, the government has accused the Gulenist movement of infiltrating the country's institutions including the police, military and judiciary and of running a state within a state. \"We are trying to cleanse members of FETO (the Gulenist movement)\" inside the armed forces, inside the judiciary and inside the police,\" President Erdogan told Reuters shortly before the raids. Before Wednesday, Turkey said a total of 47,000 people had been detained, including 10,700 police and 7,4000 members of the military. Thousands of people have lost their jobs across Turkey's public institutions, including teachers and civil servants, and opposition media outlets have been closed down. The Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly angered Turkey on Tuesday by placing the country under review and calling for urgent measures to restore freedom of expression and the press.

But Judge Kennedy said she had been \"deceitful from the outset\" and had \"lost her sense and compassion\" when she got involved. He added that she clearly cared more for Jackson than he cared for her. Granger, who posed under the name of Rachel, was wined and dined by the divorced father of three who boasted to friends he was not paying her to be with him, the court heard earlier.

It follows reports children are being used by criminals as \"money mules\". She said children looking for \"a sense of belonging, fast money\" or \"glamour\" were at risk. Ms Longfield's research has found 46,000 children in England are involved in gangs. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Sunday Breakfast programme, the children's commissioner said children as young as 10 were being recruited into gangs that could be \"extremely violent, usually intimidatory and sexually abusive, particularly towards girls\". \"These are horrific situations that young people are getting themselves into.\" Simon Dukes, chief executive of the fraud prevention organisation Cifas, said some were being persuaded to hand over access to their bank accounts to criminals for money laundering purposes. He said criminals lure children in with apparent money-making opportunities on social media, and pass money through their accounts to disguise the sources of illicit funds. \"Criminals, of course, prey on the most vulnerable and they're preying on younger people because of their lack of knowledge, in particular, about what is effectively money laundering.\" Ms Longfield said other young people were being used to transport drugs. \"Anecdotally, I'm told that middle-class children are often being targeted as well because they are less likely to be stopped. \"Children who are easier to intimidate, vulnerable in some way and often being bullied, those that are easier to control, are being picked on.\" Earlier this year, the government announced that PSHE would be made compulsory in all state schools. The government is currently consulting on what to include in the permanent curriculum, but as yet, there is no timetable for its introduction. Ms Longfield said the \"life skills lessons\" should include information on the risks of becoming involved in gangs, an understanding of how gangs target children and help in building resilience to resist them. Parents may not be aware of who their children are talking to via social media, so young people themselves need to be able to understand the difference between \"genuine opportunities\" and exploitative situations, she added. \"For younger children it will often be the draw of fast money - sometimes protection for themselves if they're fearful about their own wellbeing - but certainly also a sense of belonging, fast money, sometimes glamour... \"Life skills is something that the government has committed itself to do. \"Most schools at the moment do provide life skill lessons but they're often inconsistent and often they don't tackle some of these issues that are much harder to tackle.\" The commissioner also called for police forces to work together to produce better data on the number of children targeted by gangs. The PSHE Association, a national body working to improve PSHE education, said it supported the call for compulsory lessons to help young people understand \"the specific risks of gang membership for individuals, families and communities\".

{"id": 1486, "article": "They say it could cut the likelihood of fireballs erupting when aircraft and other vehicles crash, or are attacked. It contains very long polymer molecules which stop the fuel forming tiny, explosive droplets, but break when it flows through pipes - and then rejoin. It is described in the journal Science. \"Initial engine tests showed no adverse effect on performance and our hope is that these polymers will save lives in fatal crashes in aviation and ground transportation,\" said lead author Julia Kornfield, of the California Institute of Technology. Efforts to produce explosion-prevention additives, including a major initiative following a deadly runway collision in Tenerife in 1977, have been hampered by twin problems relating to the chemistry of hydrocarbon fuels. The obvious choice for such an additive is a long, chain-like molecule, which causes the liquid to hang together in bigger, less flammable droplets. But a fuel also has to be pumped and filtered and these forces readily tear up those long molecules into smaller, ineffective fragments - and, crucially, if the polymer remains intact and resists those forces, then it will probably hamper fuel handling or engine performance. Prof Kornfield and her colleagues have solved this dilemma by designing very long \"megasupramolecules\" that break up when the fuel flows through pipelines, but then reassemble. This rebuilding occurs thanks to \"sticky ends\" which the team designed in a theoretical model, before manufacturing and testing the additive. This design was no easy task, because the snapped ends must join back together to make long, straight chains, without forming circular molecules. Once they had a polymer that looked promising, the team added it to both diesel and jet fuel and tested how well it prevented explosions - both before and after putting it through a fuel pump 50 times. The results were promising. \"We shot a projectile at 140mph (225km/h) at a small fuel tank and observed the resulting mist using high-speed imaging,\" said Prof Kornfield, who worked with collaborators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena to develop the tests. \"We had three continuously burning propane torches deliberately in the path of the mist to make sure that it would ignite.\" In fuel treated with a small quantity of megasupramolecules, the droplets in the mist were bigger and any tiny ignitions quickly extinguished themselves - whereas the untreated fuel, predictably, turned almost instantly into a fireball. Tests in generator motors and a diesel engine showed that the fuel was just as efficient with the additive and even produced less soot than untreated diesel. The team is still investigating how the molecules might affect regular petrol - which, because of its very low flashpoint, is particularly explosive. But Prof Kornfield said they were \"cautiously optimistic\". If future development goes well, she added, the additive could be available for commercial use in two years, for diesel fuel, and five to seven years for aviation fuel. Andrew Cooper, a chemistry professor at the University of Liverpool, said that engineering a new additive based on the principles of polymer chemistry was \"an interesting take\" on the problem - and that carrying the concept from design through to testing was impressive. \"It's a nice example of basic polymer physics and polymer chemistry translating into something that is, in principle, very useful,\" he told the BBC.

{"id": 1495, "article": "But are politicians using these platforms effectively to get their message across? And does their social media effort actually translate into votes? During the final two weeks of the general election campaign, eight young voters from the BBC's Generation 2015 panel closely monitored Scotland's political parties and most prominent figures. They told the BBC Scotland news website who they thought got it right in the battle for Scotland's young voters. The entire panel agreed that a major benefit of social media as a campaigning tool was in making politicians seem more \"accessible\" than ever before. Young voter Rebecca Plenderleith, who has spent most of the campaign as an undecided voter, said social media brought a \"humanity\" to politics, while Conservative voter Struan Mackie said it enabled voters to see \"past the party\" and learn more about the personality of the candidates. But others questioned how much this perception of politicians as \"accessible\" actually translated into reality. Several of our panellists, while impressed with the high volume of politicians using social media, were disappointed that many of them would not interact with voters who weren't already clear supporters. Similarly, several felt that much of the content posted on social media seemed to be intended to rally the party faithful rather than to attract new potential voters. Lib Dem voter James Munro said: \"Posts that are just full of rhetoric don't really add anything to the debate. Slogans like 'Only the SNP can make Scotland's voice heard' or 'Only UKIP can stand up to Westminster' have no effect on me.\" Despite being a Green party member, Zoe Mcintyre has been trying to choose another party to vote for, as there is no Green candidate in her constituency. One major criticism she had was that many of the official party accounts simply reposted statements they perceived as favourable to them, without attempting to explain to voters why their policy objectives would be of benefit. The panel noted that high profile party figures appeared to be much better than less well versed candidates at showing their personality in what they posted. Several of the panel singled out Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson as \"winning at Twitter\" for her down-to-earth approach to social media. After Ms Davidson's \"You ok, hun?\" Twitter comment [on David Cameron's Twitter feed after he was accused of \"demeaning the Office of Prime Minister\" by Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy], SNP voter Craig Maclean said: \"That had me in stitches. I wouldn't vote for her party just now, but little things like that show a human nature and did warm me towards Ruth Davidson\". Labour voter Eva Murray said she thought Kezia Dugdale and Margaret Curran's \"sassy\" replies in response to personal abuse on Twitter had helped get away from the \"people in suits\" image people have of politicians, while Nicola Sturgeon was described as \"rarely, if ever, slipping up\". By contrast, our panel said many other MPs lacked the personal touch, using their Twitter feeds as \"a dump for links to manifesto points\" or simply to plug press releases. Voter Zoe Mcintyre was also critical of the length of David Cameron's personal Facebook posts, saying \"not many people have time or care enough\" to read three paragraphs of solid text. Our panel's advice to politicians on how to appeal to young voters on social media 1. Don't run a negative campaign. Focus on your message rather than making \"cheap shots\" at your opponents. 2. Show personality in what you share, don't just post generic messages. 3. Similarly, don't just post endless pictures of you on the campaign trail - particularly when the photo op seems irrelevant to the election. 4. Using hashtags can be a good idea, but anticipate ones which may get hijacked by others to make jokes at the party's expense. 5.  Adapt your posts to fit the social media platform you're on, e.g. creating easily shareable content or maybe even using emojis. But don't overdo, as it might make some young voters think you're trying too hard. James Munro was frustrated that most politicians weren't taking advantage of opportunities provided by social media to speak directly to their constituents. He said: \"Coming from up north and with most of my family in the Highlands or islands, they are very concerned about an MP who stands up for local issues rather than what's on a national scale necessarily. That's one thing I've barely seen on social media.\" While some voters liked the Conservative party's Your Manifesto tool - which extracts information from the user's Facebook profile to compile a set of policies relevant to their area - one major criticism was that while the application identified their area as Scotland, it failed to break down further into Scottish regions. Our panel repeatedly mentioned \"negative campaign messages\" - that focus on criticising other parties - as a big turn-off, while photo-shopped images making jibes at other parties were described as \"infuriatingly childish\". James Munro said: \"This election has been far too much about inter-party squabbling. I couldn't tell you a single actual policy for quite a few of the parties because it's just not on their social media at all.\" Meanwhile, Zoe Mcintyre said she was concerned that first-time voters seeing this kind of campaigning might be put off voting at all. Undecided voter Laura Fell said that more creative hashtags might have attracted voters, with most parties opting for self-evident but uninspired choices, namely #voteLabour, #VoteConservative, #voteSNP, #libdems, #votegreen2015. But undecided voter Noah Brown was also critical of more inventive hashtags such as \"I'm #SNPbecause\" and \"#WhyImVotingUKIP\", saying \"you end up with a list of other people's perceptions, rather than manifesto based realities\". James Munro also warned of hashtags like these being hijacked by those seeking to make jokes at the parties' expense. Another thing that left our panel less than impressed was politicians sharing their endless photo opportunities, particularly when they seemed to have little relevance to the election. Commenting on an image shared by the Scottish Conservatives, Zoe said: \"How is a picture of Ruth Davidson with a hawk on her arm going to convince people to vote Conservative? Surely she should be having more photos taken with the electorate!\" Noah Brown: \"In some respects I think social media brought out the worst in people, but I don't think it made a difference to how I voted. I voted Scottish Greens in the end and it was doing research on my local candidates that swung it for me.\" Struan Mackie: \"I'm still voting for the Scottish Conservatives. But references to the referendum or independence have put me off several SNP candidates, Mhari Black for example. This is a general election and rearing the independence question again isn't appropriate.\" Eva Murray: \"I think social media has a huge influence in getting people involved in politics and getting ideas out there, but I don't think it would have the power to persuade me to vote for a party other than Labour.\" Craig Maclean: \"I'm still voting SNP. My impression of the Conservative party in Scotland has become less negative due to Ruth Davidson, but I still wouldn't vote for them. My impression of Labour in Scotland has gone down, mostly because of Jim Murphy, but I do like what some of their figures in England - Andy Burnham and Diane Abbot - are saying on Twitter.\" James Munro: \"I'd definitely say Ruth Davidson has gone a long way to improving the Scottish Conservatives in my mind. I still probably would never vote for them but she seemed like the only politician on social media who was a human being and actually ran her own media.\" Rebecca Plenderleith: \"Social media has ensured that I definitely won't be voting for either the Tories or Labour. What they don't realise is that by insulting other parties on social media they come across as if they are scared that their policies alone will not be enough to win them seats. I was an undecided voter. I'll now definitely be voting Liberal Democrat.\" Laura Fell: \"Nothing in particular has persuaded my vote. I am stuck between the choice of two parties, Labour and SNP, but I hate it when parties slag each other off and start scaremongering.\" Zoe Mcintyre: \"Social media hasn't persuaded me to vote a certain way. I'm voting Labour, even though I think the majority of their posts have been pretty negative.

IS militants responded by firing rockets and deploying suicide car bombs, according to one commander. Iraq's prime minister launched the assault on Tal Afar on Sunday, a month after declaring victory in Mosul. Haider al-Abadi told the estimated 2,000 jihadists holed up inside the city, along with between 10,000 and 40,000 civilians, that they should \"surrender or die\". Tal Afar, which had a predominantly ethnic Turkmen population of 200,000 before it fell to IS in June 2014, sits on a major supply route between Mosul, about 55km (35 miles) to the east, and the Syrian border, 150km (90 miles) to the west. The city was cut off from both during the nine-month Mosul offensive by troops and allied militiamen from the Shia-dominated paramilitary Popular Mobilisation (Hashd al-Shaabi) force. But they did not attempt to retake it until this week. In the first 24 hours of the operation, pro-government forces captured 235 sq km (90 sq miles) of territory from IS, according to the US special envoy to the multinational coalition against IS that is providing air and ground support. By the second day, the troops and militiamen had reached the edge of the city. On Wednesday, they shelled IS defensive lines along the edges of the Kifah area before storming it from the south and east, commanders said. Later, the Popular Mobilisation announced on its website that units from its 11th Brigade, the Federal Police's Rapid Response Force and the Iraqi Army had taken \"full control\" of the Kifah and Nour districts. However, there was no immediate confirmation from the military. Special forces commander Brig Gen Haider Fadhil told the Associated Press that his forces had not faced tough resistance, but that he expected the fighting to be fiercer as they pushed towards the city centre.

He was initially placed under house arrest at his home in Islamabad but later transferred to the police headquarters in the city. Mr Musharraf has described the cases against him as politically motivated. Thursday's order to arrest him was an unprecedented move against a former army chief who ruled the country for almost a decade, the BBC's Orla Guerin in Islamabad says. Although he was present at court  when the warrant was issued, police made no attempt to arrest him and he rapidly returned to his home on the outskirts of the city. He was finally arrested on Friday morning and appeared at court, where a judge ruled that he should be held in custody for two days. The decision to move him from his home to police headquarters appears to be largely procedural. He is expected to appear before an anti-terrorism court in the next 48 hours.

{"id": 1510, "article": "Geraldine Pilgrim's Flight sets the lives of those men in the context of aviation history, using as a backdrop, the rich heritage of the area where it is being staged. Cumbria's links to aviation are strong - it was the birthplace of Britain's first seaplane, Waterbird, and one of the first British military airships, and its involvement with both made it a hotbed for would-be pilots in the pre-war years. Pilgrim says she found their stories and the way their simple desire to fly led to their involvement in the war \"completely extraordinary and tragic\". The men were based at Hill of Oaks on the banks of Windermere, from where Waterbird took its first flight in 1911 and which became a Royal Naval Air Service base during the war. \"Not many people know about its importance,\" says Pilgrim. \"The Hill of Oaks became a pilot training school and these young men that just wanted to fly actually got caught up in World War One. \"They became known as the 'Suicide Club' because they were only in the air for a maximum of 11 days before they were shot down.\" She says what that name made her realise was \"the enormity of the loss to the people that were left behind\", a feeling which she hopes to convey in her \"site-specific performance journey\". \"One of the images I'm thinking of is the women waiting for their boys - whether they were sons, fathers, brothers, husbands, boyfriends - to come home. \"I imagined the women looking up at the sky over the Lake District, waiting for them to come back, a bit like migrating birds coming home. \"The poignancy is that so many of them waited and waited but their boys never came back.\" She says, that while that is undoubtedly a sad image, \"I want people to be moved but I don't want them to feel unhappy\". \"It's not melancholy - we live in troubled enough times at the moment. I want it to be poignant,\" she says. Source: BBC iWonder The show is being put on at Brockhole, a \"wonderful arts and craft designed building\" beside Windermere which Pilgrim says lost many of its period features after being sold to Liverpool Health Authority in 1945. \"It was neutralised and made into one of those bland office spaces. It broke my heart when I saw it. \"Part of what we're doing is transforming the top floor and repapering the hallway with period wallpaper. \"We're giving back Brockhole some of the care and attention that it deserves.\" She says it is an important part of the process that is driving the performance - that the project \"is for and about Cumbria\". \"This was once a much loved family home and we want to make sure it still feels like it's loved and cared for. \"It is [loved] by many people in the area and they felt like it needed a bit of tender care.\" Those people are also involved in the piece, as volunteers from Westmoreland Croquet Club, Burneside Brass Band, Ashton Family Theatre, Ambleside Theatre, the University of Cumbria and Kendal College are taking roles, along with several local families. Sue Larkin got involved after her daughter encouraged her to go to a meeting with the artist about the project. She says being made \"to stop and consider the reality for the people portrayed is very sobering\". \"I think that we can all appreciate how people's feelings about the war changed. \"Everyone was so proud and excited at the start but the reality, for so many, was devastating. \"I had never appreciated how many women never married because so many young men went to war and never come home. \"And as I watch the teenagers I am acting with in my scene, keeping in constant touch with their mates via social media throughout the evening, it is also hard to imagine what it was really like to have to wait so long for any news of your loved ones. \"It must have been almost unbearable.\" Larkin says that even though she has lived in the area for 20 years, she was \"not aware of any of the stories about the families or the airmen and women\" before being told about them by Pilgrim. The artist says she is not alone in that as, for many volunteers, it is all \"genuinely new\" - and for herself, raising awareness was one of the main aims of her project. \"What I want to do is help people learn more about their own history. \"Not in a patronising way, because I'm not from here, but I've had a chance to particularly research the area. \"I'm hoping that this will make people inspired to find out more.\" Larkin says she has certainly found the project educational as being involved has seen both her daughters \"ask some really interesting questions\". \"It has been particularly enriching to work on this piece with our teenagers,\" she says. \"It has really helped them to get a bit more of an understanding of some of the realities of this conflict.\" Flight is at Brockhole on Windermere until 10 July.

{"id": 1511, "article": "When I worked with Pietersen in commentary at the World Cup he was very focused indeed. He is absolutely determined to win back his England place, and I am sure Pietersen sees this decision as an extra incentive for him to work on his comeback and what he will see as an even more realistic opportunity now. The Kevin Pietersen issue has been such a massive part of this year, and one that that was handled badly by the ECB board since they decided to sack him shortly after the 2013-14 Ashes series, which Australia won 5-0. Media playback is not supported on this device There was no need to sack Pietersen. They could merely have decided to move on and not pick him again without a big song and dance. But that is the way they chose to go. It has created such a massive reaction and they only have themselves to blame for that really. Does the decision to sack Downton from his role as managing director mean Pietersen will definitely come back? There is more to it than Downton just losing his job. For a start, KP has not faced a red ball in 18 months and there are a lot of things that still need to happen - not least Pietersen scoring some runs in the domestic game having rejoined Surrey - before we see him striding out to the middle in an England shirt again. The ECB have created a new director of England cricket following Downton's departure and I see my Test Match Special colleague, and ex-England captain, Michael Vaughan has been touted as a possible man for the job. I will be interested to see if Vaughan can commit himself completely to this job because he would have to give up a lot of other things. Vaughan would be a great candidate but he loves his media work and he has a lot of other interests that take up his time. There is no way you could have an England director of cricket doing anything else but focusing on this role 100%. It has got to be someone who is really in touch with the modern game and the direction cricket is going. Whoever is appointed needs to have retained an involvement with cricket, and someone who comes into the job with fresh ideas and with a resolve to make specific improvements. Media playback is not supported on this device Two of the names mentioned for the England director role - Alec Stewart and Andrew Strauss -  could have a major say in the next instalment of what happens with Pietersen of course. Strauss, given his history with KP, will probably take a lot of convincing that he should return to the fold. With Stewart, his coach at Surrey, it might be a bit more straightforward. We have not seen the job description for the position, but you can imagine it needs someone who is in touch with the game. It needs to be someone who has been out of it just long enough to avoid being too personally involved with the current players. Downton, who took over from Hugh Morris, was not in a position as MD in which he was solely dealing with the England team; there was much to the role. Downton had a difficult time of it. He was briefed that his first job must be to get rid of Pietersen. He took responsibility for that, but it was not 100% his call - it was a broader decision. So perhaps he was an easy person to target with regards to KP. He has taken a lot of flak for that. And likewise he was not directly hands-on with the England team. You have to question how much responsibility he actually had on England team matters. The new job, however, is going to be more targeted to the England team. It must be. The new role is probably going to be much more focused on that. The change to key elements of the administration - the chairman and the chief executive - made it likely that something had to change after England's dismal World Cup campaign and someone be shown the door. It could have been the coach Peter Moores, it could have the man responsible for selection of the team in James Whitaker. But instead what they have decided to do is reassess the role Downton has occupied which encompasses many different aspects of English cricket; from everything that is done at Loughborough all the way up to the top of the game and the England team. However, he was only marginally responsible for the England team itself. This new director of England role. Will he be a selector? Might he be a cricket supremo and we go back to the days of Raymond Illingworth with a selection committee of captain, coach and the director - for me that looks favourite at the moment. But if that is the case, James Whitaker would not have a job in the near future either. From the way that it sounds that is where they are going. It all depends on how hands-on this new director of England cricket will be.

Coroner Dr John Madden said the tragedy had shocked the whole country and news of it even travelled across the globe. He said the inquest would not solve anything for the families, but he hoped it would be one less hurdle to help them get on with the rest of their lives. The families of some of the eight men killed expressed their frustration with the remit of the Coroner's Court after the verdict. The inquest was beset by legal arguments throughout over the involvement of a third vehicle on the night of the incident. The inquest heard that Kelly's car had earlier collided with a Renault Megane being driven by a 62-year-old woman. There were a number of legal arguments over which side of the road the woman's car was on. The passengers in Kelly's car were 21-year-old Mark McLaughlin, from Fahan; Paul Doherty and Ciaran Sweeney who were 19 and from Ballyliffin; Patrick McLaughlin, 21, from Burnfoot; 22-year-old Eamonn McDaid and 21-year-old Damien McLaughlin, both from Buncrana, and James McEleney, 23, from Clonmany.

{"id": 1517, "article": "The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPeg) committee has called for controls over how image data in .jpg files is accessed. It is thought this would protect copyright and safeguard the privacy of people in images. However, rights groups have said the features might harm creativity. In an online summary of the proposals, the JPeg committee said photographs were often redistributed without relevant rights information attached, so they could easily be copied or published again without permission. And in some cases, the privacy of the photographer could be compromised if metadata embedded in the images, which could include the geo-location of wherever the photo was taken, was accessible. \"Currently, these concerns are not well addressed and [are] an inhibiting factor in the further proliferation of digital content distribution,\" the JPeg committee briefing said. The JPeg committee has no concrete plans to change the JPeg format yet, but hopes to seek technological solutions once the specifics of the new proposals have been decided, according to convener of the committee Touradj Ebrahimi. Speaking to the BBC, Dr Ebrahimi said whatever changes might be made, JPeg files would still be freely shareable if their authors wanted them to be. \"One thing that's important to note is that this is not something we're imposing,\" he said. \"We are just saying, 'Let people have a choice.' Those who are perfectly happy with today's situation and want to have security-free image sharing [will still be able to].\" Currently, when someone wants to protect an image from being viewed by certain people, it is possible to publish it on websites with their own privacy protecting software, such as Facebook. However, if the photograph is taken from that site by someone who has access to it and sent elsewhere, it could then be distributed to anyone. Dr Ebrahimi suggested that it might be better to have access controls actually built in to the file. \"It would be best if you have one image that is protected in such a way that if you have the rights, you see it clear; if you don't have the rights, you don't see it,\" he said. The idea has caused some concern among rights groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). In a blog, the EFF warned against putting tight restrictions on JPeg files and suggested the move could stifle creativity - hampering an artist from using a photograph in a new work, for example. It might also be difficult to secure the restrictions from those who wanted to crack them, said Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group. He compared the situation to digital rights management (DRM) software, which is found on products such as DVDs and prevents copying of the content. \"DRM tends to be easily broken,\" he told the BBC. \"People who want to break the rules would still do that.\" Mr Killock also expressed concerns that companies might charge steep fees for allowing certain levels of access to restricted images. \"You're going to want to edit pictures, crop them, alter them, all of these sorts of things that DRM potentially restricts, so I guess the other major beneficiary would end up being software publishers,\" he said.

{"id": 1518, "article": "While promising a fierce fight to the end, IS prepared the way in its propaganda for its military defeat in the city. The group began to shift its messaging in May 2016 amid losses in its Iraqi and Syrian heartland, saying that victory was not determined by territorial hold but persistence in faith. It emphasised its enduring ideological reach, insisting that the group was invincible even if it faced what it portrayed as temporary setbacks on the ground. IS cited a military official as saying the group had begun readying for its battle to defend Mosul from the first day it captured the city, suggesting the group knew its hold on the city could never last. Following the launch by Iraqi forces of the operation to recapture Mosul in October 2016, IS has played up the strength of its affiliates in other countries. It recently suggested that the capture of parts of the city of Marawi in the Philippines by pro-IS militants in May was reminiscent of its capture of Mosul, indicating that the symbolic centre of its so-called \"caliphate\" could be revised. The group noted that a precursor had lost control of areas of Iraq in 2007 but resurfaced much stronger. IS has demonstrated its ability to carry out attacks in various parts of Iraq outside Mosul, with a current offensive near Qayyara to the south of the city diverting attention from its crumbling \"caliphate\". It has issued multiple calls for attacks worldwide, and in June claimed a third attack in the UK and its first attacks in Iran and Israel. In the course of the battle for Mosul, IS has often said the city would prove to be a graveyard for its enemies. But on 7 July it described Mosul's Old City as a graveyard for thousands of civilians, blaming their suffering on US-led coalition bombardment. This served its narrative depicting an alleged global war against Sunni Islam. IS used the destruction in Mosul - including the landmark Great Mosque al-Nuri and Hadba minaret, reportedly orchestrated by the group itself - to serve its own ends. It boasted about the fierce resistance its members had put up in the city over almost nine months, against an array of powerful enemies. It also gloated about the material and human cost visited upon its foes. In a recent recognition of its demise in Mosul, the group said it planned to apply lessons derived from the protracted battle to future fronts in its unending war.

Six world powers are negotiating an agreement aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear activity but not ending it. Critics have argued this would trigger a nuclear arms race in the region spurred on by Saudi-Iran rivalry. \"I've always said whatever comes out of these talks, we will want the same,\" said the prince, Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief. \"So if Iran has the ability to enrich uranium to whatever level, it's not just Saudi Arabia that's going to ask for that. \"The whole world will be an open door to go that route without any inhibition, and that's my main objection to this P5+1 [the six world powers] process.\" With a late March deadline for an Iran deal approaching, Saudi Arabia last week signed a nuclear co-operation agreement with South Korea that included a plan to study the feasibility of building two nuclear reactors in the kingdom. Riyadh has also signed nuclear co-operation agreements with China, France and Argentina, and intends to construct 16 nuclear power reactors over the next 20 years. The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, flew to Riyadh earlier this month to reassure Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab allies that America would not accept any deal unless it prevented Iran from building a nuclear weapon. He was told that they found Iran's support for armed Shia Muslim groups in regional conflicts as troubling as the prospect of an atomic bomb. \"Iran is already a disruptive player in various scenes in the Arab world, whether it's Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Palestine, or Bahrain,\" said Prince Turki. \"So ending fear of developing weapons of mass destruction is not going to be the end of the troubles we're having with Iran.\" Of most concern to Saudi Arabia is Iran's backing of Iraqi Shia militias in the fight against Islamic State (IS) militants. That role has become more public during the battle over the Iraqi city of Tikrit, with General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, stepping out of the shadows to openly guide Shia forces. \"Now it seems that Iran is expanding its occupation of Iraq and that is unacceptable,\" said Prince Turki. The Americans are trying to keep a delicate balance, recognising that the US and Iran share common cause, if not co-ordinated action, against IS. The US military's top officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has said that Iran's help in the Tikrit offensive could be \"a positive thing\" providing it does not fuel sectarianism. But on a recent visit to Baghdad he expressed concern that Iraq's Shia political leaders were not taking promised action to bridge the sectarian divide with Sunni Muslim Arab tribes, and warned this could strain the anti-IS coalition of which Saudi Arabia is a member. Riyadh has also long been frustrated with America's refusal to arm the Syrians against the government of President Bashar al-Assad, Iran's closest Arab ally. So it has agreed to participate in a US-led programme to train and arm Syrian rebels even though the focus would be fighting IS, not Mr Assad. \"Inevitably I believe fighting [IS], or Fahesh as I prefer to call it, is fighting Assad,\" Prince Turki declared, using an Arabic word for obscene that rhymes with \"Daesh\", the Arabic acronym of the group's previous name Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. \"It's because of Assad's treatment of his people that Fahesh has taken advantage of the situationa€| so the enemy is both Fahesh and Bashar al-Assad,\" the former Saudi intelligence chief added.", "question": "A senior member of the Saudi royal family has warned that a deal on Iran 's nuclear programme could @placeholder other regional states to develop atomic fuel .", "option_0": "affect", "option_1": "prevent", "option_2": "prompt", "option_3": "gain", "option_4": "persuade"}

Some see the death as a bad omen for the ruling Communist Party. Its annual congress begins on Thursday and a change of leadership is expected. Cu Rua, meaning great-grandfather though it was female, will be embalmed. \"Cu\" is the Vietnamese word used to refer to old and revered people, giving some indication of the special place she occupied in the hearts of Hanoi's inhabitants. And not only Hanoians - people from all over the country also used to come to Hoan Kiem lake in Vietnam's capital to try to catch a glimpse of her. Some even waited for days. Social media in Vietnam has been flooded with posts lamenting her death, which came on a gloomy windy and wintry Tuesday afternoon. Facebook user Nguyen Viet Nam said: \"The turtle was a sacred animal for us Hanoians. Such sadness, such regret.\" Some wondered whether the timing of the death was significant. Nguyen Thanh Ha: \"Cu Rua has died! Is this a sign? Just when the Congress meets?\" Another Facebook user Dao Trung Thanh said: \"So the Hoan Kiem Lake turtle has died. Maybe it is not a sign of bad luck. Maybe it is a sign of renewal and end of slow backwardness.\" Douglas Hendrie, a Hanoi-based wildlife expert, says Cu Rua was one of only four known living specimens her kind in the world. \"But more than that, the turtle also had a significant historical, cultural and spiritual value for the Vietnamese,\" he adds. Legend has it that the turtle - believed to be more than 100 and the oldest in Vietnam - was the incarnation of a mythical creature living in the lake in the 15th Century. Local legend has it that Le Loi, a real figure from Vietnamese history who would become emperor of Vietnam, borrowed a magical sword from the Dragon King to fight against Vietnam's then Chinese oppressors. After claiming independence for the Viets, he came to the lake and returned the sword to its divine owner via its disciple - a giant turtle which surfaced to take it from his hands before disappearing beneath the jade waters. The lake duly became known as Hoan Kiem, or the Lake of the Returned Sword. Scientists are not yet sure what killed Cu Rua - pollution, climate change or simple old age - but his body is being examined by experts. The authorities have already announced she will be preserved. To many of Hanoi's residents, Cu Rua was more than a charming local character - her appearances at the same time as some of the country's biggest events, such as Hanoi's 1,000-year anniversary, were seen as auspicious - while her ailments were seen as ominous signs. So her sudden death is certainly \"viewed as a big concern\", says Mr Hendrie who has worked in Vietnam for two decades. The newly appointed mayor of Hanoi, police general Nguyen Duc Chung, is said to have promptly visited the site which was quickly cordoned off. The issue was so delicate that state censors briefly tried to prevent the news from being reported. \"To cheerfully welcome the party congress, newspapers and media please do not report on the turtle's death for now,\" the party's propaganda department instructed. But a few hours later domestic newspapers were told they could report the death - as scientifically and objectively as possible, without speculation and using \"sensitive photos\". The all-important congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party, which takes place every five years, opens on Thursday in Hanoi and the authorities are careful not to fuel any unfounded rumours around it. \"Is it a sign? I don't know,\" says Nguyen Duc Hung, a 27-year-old man from Thanh Hoa province.

This year's race saw a champion cheese-roller from Brockworth equal the all-time record for the most cheeses won. Chris Anderson won all three men's downhill races which means he has taken home 20 cheeses in 13 years. The 29-year-old's tally now equals that of record holder Stephen Gyde. Mr Anderson said he felt \"overwhelmed and exhausted\" after finishing the contest and was looking forward to celebrating. \"It's brilliant to have equalled the record, hard to put into words, so happy,\" he said. He added that he \"looks forward\" to coming back next year and beating Mr Gyde's record. Mr Anderson has famously said he does not like double Gloucester as it is \"too strong\", so this year he will be auctioning one of his cheeses off for charity, and giving the other two away to family. One family member who has a cheese of her own is Mr Anderson's niece Kacey, who won the 11-15's race for the third year in a row. She said: \"I'm feeling very tired, but I tried my best and just thought I'm going to give it another shot and see if I can get it.\" The women's race was won by 18-year-old Keavy Morgan, also from Brockworth, who has now had two victories after first winning in 2015.

{"id": 1533, "article": "That will be a shame for a leader who guided 532 pieces of legislation through a hung parliament, including some major social and environmental reforms. But for better or for worse, it will be an accurate reflection of how her premiership was perceived in Australia at the time. Julia Gillard was then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's deputy when, to stem the wound of Labor's plummeting popularity, she deposed him in a surprise coup in June 2010. The irony that he too had been given the boot, before being allowed to serve out his term as Australia's elected leader, has not been lost on the many Gillard detractors. Despite Australia's long history of political coups, that event set the idea that Julia, as she is frequently referred to in Australia, had knifed a mate. There are many narratives about what finally led to her downfall. All have elements of truth and which one you believe most depends on which tribe you belong to. To many women, it was the undeniable misogyny and sexist scrutiny she endured throughout her leadership that brought her down. \"Deliberately barren\", \"bitch\" and \"witch\" were all phrases thrown around, sometimes by opposition MPs. One of Australia's most listened-to radio commentators suggested, weeks after her beloved father passed away, that he had \"died of shame\". Another radio \"shock-jock\" asked her if her partner was gay. He lost his job. The first commentator is still on air. A Liberal party supporter penned a mock menu for a fundraiser which promised to serve up \"Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail -Small Breasts, Huge Thighs and a Big Red Box\". Even feminist Germaine Greer once said the PM's \"arse was fat\". Many Australians rightly say that no male politician has ever been subjected to such continued, personal attacks. But that is not the whole story. Even her supporters agree that her government was gifted at shooting itself in the foot. The opposition's strategy of hammering home Labor's U-turns was made easy by two big policy flips: the carbon tax and the promise of a budget surplus. It imposed the first when it said it would not and did not manage the second when it repeatedly said it would. Tony Abbott: 2, Julia Gillard: 0. Labor under Gillard was also perplexingly bad at letting the electorate know about its achievements - a revolutionary national insurance system for the disabled, a much-needed plan to save a key Australian river system, tax reform, education reform. They all seem to have been somehow overshadowed and not just by powerful negative messaging from the opposition. On the day she was delivering an historic apology to victims of forced adoptions, she was subjected to a phantom leadership challenge by her own party. Instead of a powerful message of a government righting wrongs, the electorate got a vision of a party in disarray and this was the image it carried home. Australia is nearly unique in Western democracies for the way it has survived the global financial crisis.  Unemployment is low, debt to GDP ratio is comparatively low and its citizens enjoy a remarkable standard of living. But this is not the message that Australians have absorbed. Instead it is one of a country on the verge of a crash, with unacceptably high debt and precarious finances. This is partially down to a media that seems to be particularly adept at looking for the gloom, but must also be down to a government that never found a way to explain to Australians how well they have endured the crisis. Julia Gillard herself was not the best communicator. Even her friends acknowledge she needed to show more of the passion and warmth that was there but was so often kept in reserve. But really what did for Julia was Kevin Rudd himself - the man she had toppled, who never let go of his dream of getting back into the top job. Once he challenged and failed. Another time his supporters called for him to challenge and he did not. The third time he rose again, after spending months courting the media in carefully scripted moments that were officially about campaigning for Labor, but were really about reminding voters he was still there, waiting in the wings, should they want him. Polls show Labor is likely to do much better in the coming election under Kevin Rudd than Julia Gillard and the caucus finally decided to risk seeming like a fickle rabble rather than face a thrashing under a maligned leader. Hillary Clinton famously said, when she lost out on the US Democratic party's presidential nomination, that she had not shattered her country's \"highest and hardest\" glass ceiling, but there were now 18 million cracks in it. The lesson we might take from Julia Gillard's career is that shattering Australia's glass ceiling resulted in walking on a lot of broken shards.", "question": "In the end , Julia Gillard is likely to be remembered more for the manner of her coming , the manner of her going and her gender , than for what she @placeholder during her three years as Australia 's prime minister .", "option_0": "experienced", "option_1": "described", "option_2": "occurred", "option_3": "performed", "option_4": "achieved"}

But critics had argued that the Shadow Brokers should not benefit in this way. One of the researchers behind the plan said the scheme was being abandoned for \"legal reasons\". Some critics had warned that paying the Shadow Brokers for access to their hacking tools, even with honest intentions, could be illegal. The Shadow Brokers previously sold access to hacking tools allegedly stolen from the US National Security Agency - but often released the vulnerabilities for free later anyway. One of the tools was used to help spread the WannaCry malware that affected thousands of organisations worldwide, including the UK's NHS. The hacking group currently plans to sell a new batch of security exploits, for a payment via the crypto-currency Zcash, worth about $22,000 (?¡ê17,000). On Tuesday, two security researchers set up a crowd-funding campaign to buy access to the exploits, so the vulnerabilities could be fixed instead. But the idea divided the cyber-security community. \"There's a 50-50 split on whether it is a good idea and whether it would encourage Shadow Brokers to continue their activities,\" said Matthew Hickey from the cyber-security firm Hacker House, who set up the crowd-funding campaign. Others were more outspoken: \"Individuals and corps funding criminals is insane,\" said security researcher Kevin Beaumont. Announcing the closure of the crowd-funding campaign on 1 June, Mr Hickey said: \"If you ever want to hear a lawyer shout expletives at volume down a phone, you need to call him and tell him you have created the first open source crowd-funded cyber-arms acquisition attempt. \"It transpires that should funds change hands from ours to the Shadow Brokers we would certainly be risking some form of legal complications.\" Those who have donated to the campaign using Bitcoin can seek a refund, and any unclaimed funds will be donated to online rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

But other Twitter users have been less complimentary, with one describing it as the \"worst Bond theme ever\". BBC entertainment correspondent Colin Paterson said it was \"good enough, but not a classic\". The song, whose full version runs for 4 minutes and 38 seconds, begins with the words: \"I've been here before / But always hit the floor.\" \"I've spent a lifetime running, and I always get away,\" it continues. \"But with you I'm feeling something, that makes we want to stay.\" \"I think it's a song about a man deciding to quit it all for love,\" Paterson said of the track on BBC Breakfast, comparing its melody to that of Michael Jackson's 1995 single Earth Song. He also suggested it was far superior to Die Another Day, the much-derided song Madonna contributed to the 2002 Bond film of that name. Comedian David Schneider was not convinced, greeting the song's release with the words: \"The name is Bland.

The alternative Bill will presumably be vying for parliamentary space with the legislation needed for Brexit. The final manifesto also includes the draft version's \"presumption of devolution\" when powers return from Brussels and a promise to make up the shortfall of EU funds.

The IOC also said it will: Calls for a blanket ban on Russia - from both the Olympics and Paralympics - followed the publication of the McLaren report on Monday. IOC president Thomas Bach said the findings of the report were a \"shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games\". Wada president Sir Craig Reedie described the \"scope and scale\" of the findings as a \"real horror story\". He said his organisation wanted the IOC to \"decline entries, for Rio 2016, of all athletes\" submitted by the Russian Olympic and Paralympic committees. Mutko, meanwhile, has denied that the government directed the doping programme in Russia. He also told the Interfax news agency he was hoping for a \"reasonable\" decision from the IOC on Russia's participation in Rio. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway: \"Is what Russia has done here so bad that it warrants a collective ban, as no Russian can be above suspicion and therefore no Russians should go to Rio? Or is it a case that individual sporting federations should decide for themselves if certain Russian athletes can go? It's a very complicated area. \"It looks, on the face of this statement, as though the IOC is edging towards a blanket ban. Russia want to be at the Olympics. It would be a national humiliation for them not to be. So they will fight on to try to make sure their athletes are there next month.\" Commissioned by Wada, it looked into claims made by Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russia's national anti-doping laboratory. He alleged he doped dozens of athletes, including at least 15 medallists, in the build-up to the Sochi Games. He said this was the result of an elaborate plot with the Russian government, which exploited its host status to subvert the drug-testing programme. Russia topped the table in Sochi, winning 33 medals, 13 of them gold. Rodchenkov, now in hiding in the United States, also alleged he doped athletes before the 2012 Olympics in London, the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow and the 2015 World Swimming Championships in Kazan. It has already suspended a number of senior sports officials following the publication of the McLaren report. Despite his denial of any state-sponsored doping programme, sports minister Mutko told the R-Sport news agency he had suspended anti-doping advisor Natalia Zhelanova as well as Irina Rodionova, deputy head of Russia's state-funded Sports Preparation Centre, and two other officials. McLaren said Zhelanova and Rodionova had worked closely with Russian deputy sports minister Yury Nagornykh to cover up positive tests since 2011. Nagornykh has also been suspended. Football's world governing body Fifa will look at claims in the report that Mutko was involved in covering up positive dope tests by footballers. Mutko is a Fifa council member, the president of the 2018 Russia World Cup organising committee, president of the Russian Football Union and a member of Uefa's executive. Russia's track and field athletes are already barred from competing at the 2016 Olympics in Rio as a result of doping violations. The International Association of Athletics Federations, the body that governs world athletics, voted in June to maintain a global competition ban on the All-Russia Athletic Federation (Araf). Araf hopes to overturn the suspension and will find out by Thursday if its appeal to Cas has been successful. He is the Canadian law professor who led the independent commission that looked into allegations of state-sponsored doping in Russia.

During his speech, Ken Clarke insisted he was on good terms with the people he dubbed \"the hard-line Euro-sceptics\" because he respected their sincerity. And he joked that \"hot tongs\" wouldn't make Sir Bill Cash vote for membership of the EU. Sir Bill returned the compliment. He paid tribute to Mr Clarke and declared: \"I respect him and the way in which we have battled over these matters over all these years.\" Who'd have thought we'd see such a public display of clubbable chumminess from two veterans of the bitter Maastricht rebellions?", "question": "Europe has been one of the great fault lines running through British politics , a source of party splits and @placeholder rebellions .", "option_0": "magnificent", "option_1": "neglected", "option_2": "collateral", "option_3": "parliamentary", "option_4": "classic"}

The latest person to be arrested was a 19-year-old man in the Gorton area of Manchester on Sunday. A 25-year-old man was held earlier in the Old Trafford area of the city.

{"id": 1596, "article": "Guantanamo has held some 775 inmates who have been accused of links to al-Qaeda or the Taliban. Many have been freed or transferred to foreign governments, and five have been convicted by military tribunals, leaving a reported 170 or so still in custody there. In mid-December 2009, Mr Obama ordered the preparation of a federal facility in Thomson, Illinois, to receive prisoners from Guantanamo. However, Congress has not provided funding for this. A month earlier, US Attorney General Eric Holder had said the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and four others would face a civilian trial in New York, but this has since been put in doubt. Bipartisan opposition to the transfer of Guantanamo prisoners to the US has grown. Congress has not authorised funding for transfers and Mr Holder said in April 2010 that Guantanamo could not close without it. Some prisoners are considered too dangerous to be released, yet the US holds no evidence that can be used in civilian or military trials against them. A committee convened by Mr Obama determined in January that 48 prisoners were too dangerous to transfer but could not feasibly be prosecuted. Of the rest, a large portion have been cleared for release but have nowhere to go. The US fears some would face torture in their home countries but cannot find another country to receive them. Meanwhile, in January 2010 Mr Obama suspended the release of prisoners from Yemen to that country, citing security concerns. Five prisoners, including Canadian Omar Khadr, have been convicted in military tribunals held at Guantanamo Bay. Two of those served short sentences and returned home to Australia and Yemen, and two others are serving sentences at Guantanamo Bay. What about trials in normal civilian courts? Six prisoners were approved for trial in civilian courts, including the alleged leaders of the 9/11 attacks. The first trial has now taken place, in New York City. In it, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani was convicted of only one count of 285 for his role in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in east Africa. The judge excluded much of the evidence against him because it was held to have been obtained by coercive methods. The result is being seen as a blow to President Obama's hopes of using the civilian courts for other trials. The likely result is that there will be a mix of trials, military tribunals and continuing detentions. This is unclear. The issue was not widely debated during the mid-term elections and Mr Obama has largely ceased to push for closure in public. Mr Obama has been determined to shift the balance where possible from military tribunals to civilian courts and this trial in itself was seen as a major step towards closing the camp. The plan was to have the trial of the main alleged conspirators take place in New York City, close to the scene of the 9/11 attacks, but local objections, largely on grounds of security, have forced a rethink. Moving the trial somewhere else is possible; another option is to hold a military tribunal. The procedure would be the same as for any other civilian trial, though parts of it might be closed when secret information is being presented. The trial would be different from the military tribunal the defendants had faced. There would be a civilian jury which has to decide the issues unanimously, and defence lawyers would have greater scope to challenge any confession that might have been based on waterboarding. The result of the Ghailani case was hailed by some as a vindication of the civilian system but by others as a threat to US security. The attorney general said he would seek the death penalty, which is allowed in a federal court. Yes, because the task force looking into this says the \"realities of the battlefield\" might prevent the normal collection of evidence. Soldiers could not, for example, be expected to read a captured prisoner his rights, something required in civilian cases. Intelligence sources might also have to be protected. Some relatives of the 9/11 victims are opposed to the camp's closure, believing that it is a secure location to try terror suspects. Human rights groups have broadly welcomed the move. However, some activists and lawyers have expressed concern about how long it is taking to close Guantanamo, and that some form of military tribunal or even indefinite detention will continue.", "question": "US President Barack Obama was unable to close the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba by 22 January 2010 , as he had @placeholder .", "option_0": "predicted", "option_1": "suggested", "option_2": "intended", "option_3": "requested", "option_4": "prepared"}

They are dark and mysterious, yet this is a personal statement of loss.

The pictures work as single frames but together they show what can be achieved by an artist with a camera, and though widely seen before are well worth another look. Fukase was born in 1934 in Bifuka, Japan, and the defeat of his country during World War Two is said to have shaped much of his work, and indeed that of others with whom he collaborated.

They include soldiers, war-time nurses, students who entered battle and those who committed suicide in shame at the end of World War II. At the centre of the shrine's controversy is the fact that those venerated include 14 convicted Class A war criminals, including Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo, who was executed for war crimes in 1948. Within the shrine, the souls of the dead are worshipped rather than just remembered. According to Japan's national Shinto religion, humans are transformed into kami or deities when they die, and as such, are worshipped by their descendants. Surrounded by war banners and military regalia, the Yasukuni kami are venerated by hundreds of thousands of visitors at the shrine each year. Compared with most Shinto shrines, which were founded hundreds of years ago, the dedication of the Yasukuni shrine was a relatively recent affair. Analysts say that because the main wars it commemorates are those with China and the US, it appears to the political left to symbolise foreign invasions. To the right, it is a symbol of patriotism. The shrine is frequently at the centre of political storms. There have been several parliamentary debates aimed at removing General Tojo's kami, but nationalists have blocked these every time. The debate intensifies in the lead up to 15 August - the anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. Several lawmakers pay their respects at the shrine each year, but only one prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1985, has made an official visit since the war. Former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made what he said was a private visit on his birthday in July 1996. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made six visits to Yasukuni during his time in office from 2001-2006. Arguments have ensued over whether these were made in a private or official capacity. Visits by leaders and senior ministers anger Japan's Asian neighbours, especially China, South Korea and North Korea, who were victims of the country's military aggression in the first half of the 20th century.

{"id": 1618, "article": "Most men over the age of 60 have non-cancerous growth of the prostate gland. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says many of these, if they are having symptoms, could have the new therapy rather than conventional surgery. The treatment delivers a beam of green light to vaporise overgrown tissue. The standard care currently is to cut away the tissue using a thin, hot loop of wire during a procedure known as TURP. While TURP is effective, experts say the new laser treatment could be more convenient for patients. Unlike TURP, it can be done as a day treatment, meaning the patient does not have to stay in hospital overnight. This should save the NHS money too - up to an estimated ?¡ê3m, says the NICE. For the laser treatment, a thin length of laser fibre is passed up the urethra (the tube in the penis that carries urine out of the body) until it reaches the target - the prostate gland that sits just below the bladder and enwraps the urethra. The laser is then turned on to blast the tissue. This should reverse any blockages and alleviate the patient's symptoms. Prof Carole Longson, from the NICE, said: \"Whilst benign enlarged prostates may not be life-threatening, the condition can impact on men's lives significantly. \"A procedure to reduce the amount of excess prostate tissue can improve the quality of life for men.\" Higher risk men with very large prostates (bigger than 100ml) or severe symptoms, however, should still be treated with TURP or stronger lasers. The prostate gland is part of a man's reproductive system, and its job is to make the fluid to carry and nurture sperm. An enlarged prostate - known as BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) - is very common, particularly as men get older, and will not always need treating. Left untreated, it can get in the way of emptying the bladder, meaning you have to go to the toilet more often or need to strain to pass urine. In the long term, this could potentially cause other problems such as urine infections or damage to the bladder or kidneys. BPH can sometimes be managed with medication, but a procedure, such as TURP or a laser treatment, may be recommended.", "question": "Some 13,000 men in England could benefit from a laser treatment to manage symptoms from an enlarged prostate , the NHS is being @placeholder .", "option_0": "declared", "option_1": "advised", "option_2": "funded", "option_3": "offered", "option_4": "developed"}
{"id": 1619, "article": "The team, from the University of Bristol, found that raindrops kick off very fast vibrations in the lid of the plant's jug-shaped leaves. This propels ants from the lid into the pitcher trap below, where they drown and are consumed by digestive juices. The findings, published in the journal PNAS, are based on high-speed cameras and laser vibration measurements. Using these instruments, Dr Ulrike Bauer and her colleagues recorded extremely fast movement in the lid of the pitcher leaf, after it was hit by a raindrop. It wobbles like a stiff spring, she said. \"You have a raindrop hitting the surface and that causes it to move down, fast. Then because of this spring property, it moves to a certain point and springs back. \"You get an oscillation, very similar to when you put a ruler on the edge of your desk and flick the end down with your finger.\" This movement is unique in the plant kingdom, Dr Bauer said - partly because of its speed, which easily outstrips the insect-trapping manoeuvres of other carnivorous plants, and partly because of the way it exploits an external energy source. \"Having a fast movement in a plant is unusual in itself,\" she explained, \"but having a fast movement that doesn't require the plant to invest any energy - it just requires it to build the structure - that's something quite surprising.\" The findings place the species in the study, Nepenthes gracilis, into its own carnivorous category; it belongs neither with \"active\" carnivorous plants, like flytraps, nor motionless \"passive\" insect eaters - like most other pitcher plants. Key to the pitcher's rain-powered trap is the stiffness of its lid. When the team studied another species, which catches ants using only the slippery rim of its pitcher, they found it had a more bendy lid. This meant that vibrations from a falling raindrop were concentrated right at the tip - much like the motion of a springboard used in competitive diving, Dr Bauer explained. \"It concentrates the acceleration at the very tip. If you try to jump off the middle of a diving board, it's not very effective. That's why divers walk to the very edge.\" This is no good for the pitcher plant, if it is going to bounce ants into its maw. \"The pitcher wants to maximise the area where insects fall from that surface,\" Dr Bauer said.

At the tour's climax in July 1973 at London's Hammersmith Odeon Bowie announced that \"this is the last show we'll ever do\" to the astonishment of devoted fans.

{"id": 1628, "article": "Being born before 34 weeks of pregnancy is linked to a host of health problems. The study,published in the Lancet, showed that using a \"cervical pessary\" reduced the rate in the at-risk group. Doctors said more studies were needed before the technique was used routinely. The authors said 13 million babies were born prematurely every year. In the trial, doctors were looking at women who had a cervix - part of the lower section of the uterus - which was shorter than 25mm. These pregnant women are thought to be at a higher risk of an early delivery. The cervix was measured between 18 and 22 weeks into the pregnancy by an ultrasound scan. Of the 11,875 women who took part in the trial, 726 had a cervical length less than 25mm. Half of these women had a pessary, a small ring of silicone, inserted into their cervix. In the group of women without the pessary, 27% of babies were born prematurely. The rate was six per cent among those fitted with a pessary. Maria Goya, one of the researchers at the Vall d'Hebron Hospital, said: \"Placement of a pessary is an affordable procedure, non-invasive, and easy to insert and remove as required.\" The study concluded the pessary was a \"reliable alternative for prevention of preterm birth\" in a group of at-risk women. Prof Steve Thornton of the University of Exeter, a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: \"The difference in the two groups is pretty amazing.\" He said more research was needed to prove that it worked, and to find out if it could help other women at risk of a premature birth. \"If this is borne out it could make a big difference,\" he added. Drs Steve Caritis and Hyagriv Simhan, of the Magee Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh, said the findings had \"renewed enthusiasm for the cervix as a therapeutic target\" in preventing premature births.

The new Sunday prime-time series begins in mid-February. \"The objective is to engage people actively in the process of making art,\" Mr Bell said at a launch event at London's National Portrait Gallery. \"This is an arts programme but absolutely designed to go beyond the core arts audience. It feels fresh, exciting and different.\" Two artistic mentors, Diana Ali and Pascal Anson, will guide the 10 contestants through different disciplines such as portraiture, landscape and still life. At the end of each episode, the contestants' work will be exhibited to members of the public before three judges - Dr David Dibosa, Lachlan Goudie and Daphne Todd - decide which contestant will be eliminated. Anson - who previously painted eight British Airways planes for the London 2012 Olympic Games - said viewers would see \"lots of high emotion\" as the artists were pushed out of their comfort zones. \"Both Diana and myself really push them hard because that's when you get the best out of someone,\" he said. \"Concentrating for six hours on a painting is very draining and can lead to all sorts of emotions - from crying at one end to being very elated at the other.\" The BBC Arts winter line-up also includes programmes about a range of cultural figures including Maya Angelou, Francis Bacon, Phyllida Barlow, Marlon Brando, Chrissie Hynde, Dame Vera Lynn and Terry Pratchett.

And it does what it says on the tin: so far, the billboard has produced over 9,000 litres of drinking water - 96 litres a day. The panel is strategically located in the village of Bujama, an area south of the capital city that is almost a desert, where some people have no access to clean water. Despite tough conditions with little rain, air humidity reaches 98%, says UTEC. \"The panel traps humidity in the air and transforms it into water.

{"id": 1657, "article": "It says many young people are unaware a professional advocate is available through their local authority. The report says there is a lack of strategic leadership from the Welsh government to ensure children have equal access to the service. But a government spokesman said it was committed to children and \"driving forward\" their rights. Over seven months 500 children and young people across Wales were spoken to. The report, called Missing Voices, was the commissioner Keith Towler's first statutory review and looked at independent professional advocacy for looked after children and young people; care leavers and children in need. Case study: David* David was placed in 61 different foster and children's homes between the ages of five and 15. David's main regret was that, despite being very close to his brothers and sisters before he was taken into care, he was not able to see them very often. Social services only arranged for them to meet up once a year at Christmas. He said it was a reunion he looked forward to all year but was left devastated on one occasion when social services failed to organise the event. *Not his real name Mr Towler said he was saddened by the findings. \"The purpose of my review is not to point the finger of blame at anyone but instead to reinvigorate national and local partners to get Wales back on track so that no child is denied access to a professional advocate,\" he said. He made 29 recommendations, suggested fundamental changes to national structures and stressed the importance of ensuring all children had equal access to these representatives. Mr Towler said: \"I should not be hearing of episodes where children had been denied access to an advocate and that assumptions had been made they would not benefit from a professional advocate as they were too young. \"During the course of this review we have heard of excellent practice but these pockets of good practice must now become the norm across Wales.\" The review's key findings included a lack of clarity and consistency about the way services are commissioned; a lack of strategic leadership by the Welsh government to make sure eligible children and young people have equal access; and there was no annual or systematic monitoring inspection or regulation of the service. A Welsh government spokesman said it had issued \"clear guidance\" for local authorities on providing independent, effective and accessible advocacy services. \"We are one of only a handful of countries to have embedded children's rights into our domestic law. Advocacy sits firmly within children's rights as a way for children and young people to be heard when they want someone on their side, someone to help them be safe, to participate and to have access to provisions.\" By law, every local authority must provide an independent professional \"voice\", also known as an advocate, for every looked after child and young person, care leaver and child in need. They should have access to one when decisions are being made about them or if they want to make a complaint. Children's charity Tros Gynnal Plant welcomed the report. \"We feel that it gets to grips with many of the issues that we have experienced over the past 10 years,\" executive director Roger Bishop said. \"We strongly believe that if the recommendations of this report are implemented it would change the life chances for many of our children and young people.\"", "question": "Vulnerable children do not realise they are entitled to an independent \" voice \" to @placeholder them , a report claims .", "option_0": "represent", "option_1": "inspire", "option_2": "stay", "option_3": "develop", "option_4": "prevent"}

Although the number of visits to banks may be falling, the proportion of those who use a branch, however infrequently, is relatively unchanged. This has prompted a warning from the forecasters that the public still see branches as having a role to play. On Tuesday, the industry marked the 50th anniversary of the first cash machine, and many ATM manufacturers claim that new technology allows the most up-to-date machines to carry out 90% of all tasks conducted in a branch.

These will not be simply be tasks that had been carried out in branches. Many customers - primarily high-income professionals - will shift from banking via computers, it claims. Interactions made using a laptop or desktop will decrease by 63% between 2017 and 2022, it estimates.

However, Mr Comey testified that she did not break the law or mislead investigators. Mrs Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, used private email servers while secretary of state. She said she used the email servers for convenience and said she did not send or receive classified information. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Mr Comey's recommendation proves Mrs Clinton is \"living above the law\" and questioned whether she should be briefed on classified information as a presidential candidate. Mr Comey said he and the FBI investigated the case in a \"professional and apolitical way\". \"No reasonable prosecutor would bring this case,\" FBI Director James Comey said of his recommendation that Hillary Clinton not charged for her use of a private email server. \"I know that frustrates people.\" It certainly had Republicans up in arms, expressing incredulity at Comey's assertions that Mrs Clinton set up her server for \"convenience\" and that she did not instruct her lawyers to permanently delete all her emails they deemed personal. Perhaps the biggest news, however, came when committee chairman Jason Chaffetz said he would instruct the FBI to investigate whether Mrs Clinton lied when she told Congress under oath that she did not email classified information. Mr Comey said that this was a matter previously outside his purvey. On Tuesday we learned the number of Clinton emails bearing classified markings - three - and that the markings were the letter \"c\" in parenthesis in front of paragraphs that contained classified details. Mr Comey said, however, that Mrs Clinton may not have known this denoted the presence of classified information. It was another chance for Republicans to express shock and outrage. And given that the FBI could be back in the Clinton-investigating business, it likely won't be the last. The FBI found more than 100 pieces of classified information on the servers. Mr Comey said Clinton and her staff were \"reckless\" but no \"reasonable prosecutor\" would bring forth criminal charges in the case. \"If your name isn't Clinton, or you're not part of the powerful elite, then Lady Justice will act differently,'' Republican Representative from Utah Jason Chaffetz said. He said the FBI set a \"dangerous precedent\" in recommending not charging Mrs Clinton. Mr Comey said the \"c\" markings were in the body of the emails and not at the top where they would have been more visible. Democratic members of the committee holding the hearing said Republicans were using it as way to hurt Mrs Clinton politically. \"This should be called out for what it is, another blatant political stunt by Republicans to try and keep the issue alive after career DOJ officials declared the case closed because they didn't get the outcome they wanted,\" a Clinton campaign official said in a statement.", "question": "FBI Director James Comey @placeholder his recommendation not to charge Hillary Clinton over her use of private email during a Congressional hearing .", "option_0": "admits", "option_1": "made", "option_2": "urging", "option_3": "hopes", "option_4": "defended"}
{"id": 1676, "article": "He last played in anger more than 30 years ago. Maybe the only time you have seen him is as part of a Fifa Ultimate Team. A punchy 94 overall rating by the way. So why the fuss over Johan Cruyff? Before Cruyff, players used to just run straight into each other and hope for the best. Well, not quite. But when the Dutchman left Sweden's Jan Olsson staggering like a closing-time drunk in the 1974 World Cup, no-one had seen anything like it. A dropped shoulder, a dummied pass, a flick off the instep, swivel and away. It makes little sense written down. But watch the video and you'll recognise it instantly. The 'Cruyff turn' is now a standard in every playground fancy-dan's box of tricks, and it all started with this man. Media playback is not supported on this device Where do you play? An easy question. But there were no easy answers when you were part of the Netherlands' 1974 World Cup squad. The orange shirts would endlessly bomb forward, cover back, switch wings and swap positions, creating space and causing havoc. Stick with your man? Good luck with that. After winning everything going in the Netherlands with Ajax, Barcelona bought Cruyff for a then world record fee of ¡ê922,000. Cheap at twice the price. As a player, he won one La Liga title at the Nou Camp. He returned as a manager to win another four. And a European Cup. But his greatest legacy is not in the trophy cabinet. It is La Masia. Before Cruyff took charge, Barcelona's academy concentrated on strength and fitness. He put the ball at the centre of everything and the small-but-beautiful generation  of Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi emerged. As Pep Guardiola said: \"Johan Cruyff painted the chapel. Barcelona coaches since merely restore or improve it.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Last month, a Barcelona penalty sent ripples through soccer, social media and the world at large. Instead of shooting at goal in the 6-1 win over Celta Viga, Messi cheekily rolled the ball sideways off the spot for team-mate Luis Suarez to smash home. A true original? Nope, another riff on the Cruyff playbook. Back in 1982, Cruyff and team-mate Jesper Olsen did the same for Ajax. But better. After controlling Cruyff's pass off the spot, Olsen drew the keeper and rolled it back for the original penalty-taker to slot into an empty net. Might Messi and Suarez have been paying tribute to Cruyff with their recreation? Before David Beckham aped Michael Jordan with number 23, before Mario Balotelli used 45 (4+5) as a shortcut to number nine, Johan Cruyff was the first superstar to stray from the usual one to 11 shirt numbers. The Dutchman took to wearing 14 for good luck after an Ajax win over rivals PSV Eindhoven. He was allowed to keep it on international duty when an alphabetical system would have seen him play in number one. In the wake of his death, financial traders paid tribute by placing orders for 14 shares in his former club Ajax. It rose 4% in value on the back of their purchases. And the shirt shenanigans didn't stop with Cruyff senior. With the Cruyff name weighing heavily, Johan's son Jordi, now sports director at Israeli club Maccabi Tel-Aviv, used his first name instead on his shirt. When he moved to Manchester United in 1996, he became one of the first players to be allowed to have something other than their surname across their shoulders in the Premier League.", "question": "The last time he @placeholder was 20 years ago .", "option_0": "managed", "option_1": "lost", "option_2": "called", "option_3": "major", "option_4": "left"}
{"id": 1677, "article": "CNN said Venezuelans would now be able to access its information without charge on the internet. Venezuela's National Telecommunications Commission (Conatel) accused CNN of \"defaming and distorting the truth\". The accusation came after CNN broadcast a report on alleged passport fraud at the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq. The report alleged that Venezuelan Vice-President Tareck El Aissami was directly linked to the granting of 173 passports, including to members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah, which is designated a terrorist group by the US and other Western powers. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez gave a news conference on Wednesday in which she dismissed the allegations. She accused the whistleblower behind them of being an \"agent in the service of international intelligence agencies\" and of having links to Venezuelan opposition groups. The ban on the US news channel comes at a time of rising tension between the United States and Venezuela. On Monday, the US treasury department sanctioned Vice-President El Aissami for allegedly trafficking drugs. In its statement, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) described him as a drug \"kingpin\" who worked with traffickers in Mexico and Colombia to ship drugs to the US. Mr El Aissami accused the US of imperialist aggression. Tension rose further late on Wednesday when US President Donald Trump posted a photo of himself in the White House meeting Lilian Tintori, the wife of jailed Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. Mr Lopez is serving a 14-year jail sentence for inciting violence at mass protests in 2014. Mr Lopez, who leads the Voluntad Popular (Popular Will) party says the sentence was politically motivated. Before the tweet, President Maduro had said: \"I don't want problems with Trump\". But after the tweet was posted, Foreign Minister Rodriguez wrote on Twitter that she rejected \"the meddling and aggression of US President @realDonaldTrump who tries to give orders in our fatherland\". She also tweeted that President Trump had \"sided with the boss behind violent acts\" while President Maduro had proposed \"initiating a new era of respectful relations\" between the two.", "question": "CNN 's Spanish @placeholder service has begun broadcasting on YouTube after the Venezuelan government pulled it from the country 's cable channels .", "option_0": "language", "option_1": "culture", "option_2": "association", "option_3": "satellite", "option_4": "national"}
{"id": 1678, "article": "The UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) said it assisted in the removal of 31,266 pages last year, compared with 13,182 in 2013. It said in many cases, each address contained more than one photo or video. The figures do not necessarily indicate that illegal activity is increasing. Instead, they may simply reflect that the charity recently began taking a proactive approach, seeking out child abuse imagery rather than just acting on others' reports. It was able to do this after the UK's four biggest internet service providers committed an extra ?¡ê1m over four years to fund its efforts. If the material is hosted overseas, the organisation notifies local authorities and then chases up complaints until the material is removed. \"Our ability to actively seek out child sexual abuse imagery created a significant step-change in the effectiveness of the IWF,\" said chief executive Susie Hargreaves. The body's annual report says: The IWF said image-hosting platforms that create a specific web address link when a file is uploaded were the most common type of misused service it had encountered, accounting for about 63% of the offending pages detected. Such systems typically create what appears to be a random string of numbers and digits as the address, making it harder to trace those sharing extreme material. One expert suggested this might have contributed to their appeal. \"The paedophiles are looking for ways to make it more difficult for law enforcement to detect them sharing child abuse imagery,\" said Prof Alan Woodward, who advises Europol on the issue. \"There is a lot of research being done on automatically detecting the images themselves and what keywords to look for in related text. \"But if the paedophiles are sharing what is effectively a signpost - written in code that is in no way related to the nature of material linked to online - then there is much less chance of identifying either those sharing such extreme material or where it is located, in order that it can be removed.\" The web has any number of photo-sharing, or \"image hosting\" sites. They are legal, mostly free and easy to use. Register, log on, upload and you have your own private collection of images. Only people you select can view them and only once you've sent them a link.  No one else will know what is in your collection. The link is just a line of code that reveals nothing. And that is where the problem lies. Paedophiles are becoming increasingly aware that known images of abuse can be tracked and traced if shared conventionally: each image has a unique hash value that can trigger red flags for both email providers and law enforcement. A line of code or URL directing a user to a private collection on an \"image hosting\" site is anonymous and triggers no alerts. The IWF figures seem to back up the theory that paedophiles are increasingly turning to these sites. In 2013 analysts found 5,594 such URLs - a figure that had risen to 19,710 by the following year. Indeed, that accounts for almost two thirds of all links to obscene material identified by the IWF.

But it was in 2010 that he was promoted to the rank of four-star general and on exactly the same day as Kim Jong-un was promoted. That military promotion list was the North Korean leader's major public debut, a sign that he was the anointed one. Very little is really known about his fellow general Mr Hyon, but one clear sign of his growing influence in the final years of Kim Jong-il's rule was that he served on the committee for Kim Jong-il's funeral in December 2011. He rose to sudden prominence when he replaced the powerful former army chief, Ri Yong-ho in the summer of 2012.  Analysts said at the time that the reshuffle appeared to be an attempt by Kim Jong-un to stamp his authority on the army. But it is unclear exactly why Mr Hyon has now been purged like this, as he only made the transition into this position of defence minister in June 2014. Since then, there has been little coverage that would suggest a trajectory out of the ordinary and there is little in his background that provide clues to his downfall. According to DPRK state media, Hyon Yong-chol was born in January 1949 in North Hamgyo'ng Province and joined the military in March 1966. He served in the army's ground forces, been a battalion commander and brigade commander, according to North Korea analyst Michael Madden. His political career began with his election as deputy a (delegate) to the 12th Supreme People's Assembly in 2009.  After his name appeared on the four star general promotions list in 2010, he was elected a member of the Korean Workers' Party central committee at the so-called 3rd Party Conference. He is one of the cast of figures who attended the numerous military inspections with Kim Jong Un and some analysts saw him as a close military adviser. In June 2014 Hyon Yong-chol was appointed Minister of the People's Armed Forces and a member of North Korea's influential National Defense Commission.

Police said the 57-year-old woman had been holding on to the fence before the force of the jet engines threw her backwards, causing serious injury. She was taken to hospital for treatment, but died later. The particular stretch of beach on the Dutch territory is popular with tourists, partly because the planes fly extremely low over the sand before landing. The beginning of the runway is just 50m (160ft) from the fence on Maho beach, and about the same distance to the waterline. What is a jet engine air blast like? There are prominent warning signs in the area instructing beachgoers not to stand near the fence because of the dangerous air blasts. Despite the danger, a number of videos circulating online show tourists clinging to the fence to prevent being swept away - and in some cases, almost being lifted off the ground. The island's tourism director, Rolando Brison, told the New Zealand Herald he had spoken to the family of the dead woman. \"I met with the family of the deceased this evening and while they recognised that what they did was wrong, through the clearly visible danger signs, they regret that risk they took turned out in the worst possible way,\" he said.

American judge Daniel Fitzgerald and British judge Howard Foster both scored the fight 114-112, while Canadian Alan Davis scored it 117-109. \"It's an unbelievable feeling, I'm world champ - I made history,\" said DeGale, who improves to 21 wins (14 KOs) and one defeat in the paid ranks. \"I will take on any super-middleweight in the world.

More than 120 people have been killed in the violence since anti-government protests began sweeping through the country on 1 April. The government blames right-wing \"terrorists\" but the UN suggests dozens were killed by the security forces. The law was passed unanimously by the constituent assembly, a body convened by President Nicol¨¢s Maduro. The assembly has deeply divided Venezuelans, many of whom see it as a way for the president to expand his power and sideline the opposition-controlled legislative. It has also been condemned by international leaders and by the Pope, who urged President Maduro not to inaugurate it. President Maduro said the constituent assembly would promote peace by bringing different sectors of society together to rewrite the constitution. But since its 545 members were sworn in on Saturday, the political situation has swiftly deteriorated. While it was ostensibly created to rewrite the constitution, the new body has taken a series of decisions unrelated to the constitution. One of its first moves was to sack chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who in recent months has become a vocal critic of the government. It also passed a decree prohibiting the opposition-controlled legislative from taking any action that would interfere with laws passed by the new constituent assembly. The decisions were taken unanimously, bolstering the opposition's claim that the constituent assembly is made up entirely of government loyalists. The newly created truth commission will be lead by Delcy Rodr¨ªguez, who also heads the constituent assembly.

The UN team said it was \"unclear who the perpetrators in the remaining deaths may be\". Ms Rodr¨ªguez said there would be \"an end to impunity\" with the new truth commission.

{"id": 1687, "article": "That's the theory of a hackathon. To find out how they work, I enter one held during Music Tech Fest, which is on tour in Boston. The event is dedicated to music technology, my favourite topic. On Saturday, I arrive at Microsoft's New England Research and Development Center (yes, the Nerd Center) and at half past one, it's time to start - hackathon organiser Adam John Williams energetically shouts \"go\". You wouldn't know it, though - people are just sitting and chatting. Where's the intensity? Where's the urgency? It feels like someone's bought a whole load of ingredients for a cake, but no recipes. Some people have, however, come here with ideas in mind. For example, Sean Manton, a gifted musician, biomedical researcher, coder and fire dancer. He would like to use his dragon staff - a pole that he spins - to control music playback-speed during a performance. Physical designer Elio Icaza Milson has agreed to help Sean 3D-print a holder for a micro-sensor. The sensor should detect rotation speed and send data wirelessly to a computer - assuming it can be attached to the staff. It's all quite fun. But I don't have any ideas yet, so I help MJ, a pan-piping beatboxer, record a track. Ten hours in, we move to a TV studio up the road for the overnight segment. RedStar Union is a cool venue with a stage, musicians and a room full of kit to stream music content live on the web. Tonight it's rammed with Oculus Rift virtual reality headsets and computers in the front room, and hackers and kit wherever we can fit. It's a pretty intensive experience, and not without some mischief. After being cooped up in a small room for most of the evening, we decide to storm the stage for some very loud creative idea exchanges. One of my stage cohorts is CJ Carr, another musician and hacker specialising in machine-generated music and music therapy. He's making what he's calling a Hexadecipus - a 16-legged music controller made from a playable painting. It's about 3am, so I compose some music for the Hexadecipus. It's in 17/4 time signature... because it has 16 legs and a head. At 4am I ask Music Tech Fest founder Michela Magas why people take part in hackathons. She says it is an opportunity to \"collide with another wonderful mind who has been researching something different from you - you two might find synergies and something magical might happen\". It's fun collaborating amid the chaos. We are hacking, playing, colouring and occasionally breakdancing through the night. There are also horrible potato crisps that I keep eating to make sure they're horrible. Sean's flatmate has brought his piano in amid the music and wires and crisps and caffeine - and there's not a single spare plug socket in sight. I'm having a great time. I wonder whether staying up all night lowers barriers to creativity, or just makes us go a little crazy. At around 8.30am (19 hours in) inspiration strikes over breakfast when I say a doughnut tastes of D major. For the first time in my life, people hear that and think: data set. So, they ask a few more questions and we eat a few more doughnuts. I don't normally talk about my synaesthesia, but one of the connections is that is I hear music when I eat things. Synaesthesia is where the senses are mixed together - for example seeing colour when listening to music - or tasting food and hearing chords. Developers Alex Dorsk and Danny Kirschner are fascinated by this, and together we have the idea to make an app that pairs music with food. Alex uses Balsamiq, a sketching program to help us imagine the app layout and what we'd like it to do. Dan works on the actual mechanics of the app on a program called Ruby on Rails. Meanwhile I am working out which data the user needs to enter and what the app needs to return - basically how the app and the user will ultimately interact. It feels fantastic to hack through the night - though that could be the sleep deprivation. We finish the first draft just in time, so it's back to the Nerd Center to present our idea, which we've called SoundBites.

Earlier, in their appeal, Sussex Police had said they believed he had gone to Manchester because he had family links in the city. In November 2010, Dunne admitted the manslaughter of Gordon Stalker, 51, on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely. Sussex Police said the level of security he was originally detained under was approved by the Ministry of Justice. After Dunne handed himself in, Lisa Rodrigues, chief executive of Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"We were concerned for Mr Dunne's welfare and we worked closely with Sussex Police throughout their investigation.\" The NHS trust had said Dunne posed a \"low risk\" after he was reported missing. During the court case, Dunne, formerly of Chates Farm Court, Brighton, told Lewes Crown Court he believed Mr Stalker was controlling his mind and he could only be freed by killing him. The pair were neighbours in a shared house in Elm Grove, Brighton, where they were friends and often socialised together.

Ms Leslie, MP for Bristol North West, is one of several local MPs to raise concerns about the investigation and the decision by the PCC to \"call upon\" him to resign, which effectively means he has to go. The Conservative MP for Bridgwater, Ian Liddell-Grainger, likened the process to a \"witch hunt\" and said Mr Gargan had been \"pilloried\", after an independent misconduct panel recommended he keep his job. North East Somerset MP Jacob Rees Mogg has also criticised the process. Mr Gargan was suspended in May last year, amid allegations of inappropriate conduct towards female staff. An IPCC investigation found those allegations were not proven, but that he had \"repeatedly breached data protection principles\" and had stored \"intimate\" material on his police-issue phone. Ms Leslie, Mr Gargan's local MP, told the BBC she was concerned about the precedent set for future chief constables. \"I also have deep concerns over the way misleading accusations have been broadcast in the press while Mr Gargan has had no ability to defend himself during that process,\" she said. \"The whole case has been taken out of objective scrutiny and investigation and into a media court.\" However, other local Conservative MPs, including Somerset MPs David Warburton, Rebecca Pow and James Heappey have backed Ms Mountstevens. Mr Heappey said in August: \"It is apparent that he no longer has the confidence of the men and women in his command, and both the complaints against him and the cost of the proceedings have outraged many of my constituents.\" Ms Mountstevens said she had begun the process of requiring Mr Gargan to resign \"following concerns raised to me from all levels of the police service that he had lost their confidence\" as well as \"hundreds of residents\" and some MPs.", "question": "\" Grave @placeholder \" were made in the investigation into a chief constable found guilty of misconduct , a Conservative MP has said .", "option_0": "remains", "option_1": "extreme", "option_2": "comments", "option_3": "mistakes", "option_4": "secret"}

In future he envisages banking will be made much simpler - with people able to conduct transactions on social media platforms such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Accenture is currently working with a number of UK banks to allow customers to interact with their banks - get balance information and transfer money - via Amazon's smart home speaker Alexa. He also imagines how banks could use systems such as Alexa to transcribe conversations with customers to cut down on \"form-filling\". \"Rather than sit down and log on to a website, people want to interact naturally,\" said Mr McIntyre. The vast majority of customers, according to Accenture, want both easy digital interactions and the ability to speak to a human. \"People want a dialogue and as AI is more and more able to replicate that, so it doesn't feel like speaking to a machine,\" he said.

The tide of technological change can't be resisted,  but should be seen as a boon for the economy, it is argued. Robots and automation could eventually replace everything from some nursing and surgical jobs to meal preparation, driving and washing elderly patients. In some parts of rural and regional Australia more than 60% of jobs could be lost, said CEDA Chief Executive Professor Stephen Martin. \"The pace of technological advancement in the last 20 years has been unprecedented and that pace is likely to continue for the next 20 years,\" he said. A more radical suggestion proffered in the report is the idea that robots could \"offer support for lonely people\". If that seems hard to believe,  just 10 years ago no-one thought there would be a car that drove itself. Google has now designed such a car, which has driven around California without any accidents - except when a human driving another car rear-ended the robotic vehicle. That development alone could dramatically change the Australian workforce where about 25% of all jobs involve driving a car, van, or truck. Other jobs that could disappear include cytologists who screen calls from patients for signs of cancer and any job that requires routine measurement or pattern recognition. We might even start growing trees in particular shapes so that robots can pick the fruit. Machine-learning algorithms are already taking a larger share of skilled jobs such as legal clerks, market research and sales, and credit-risk assessments. It is vision of the future that isn't all shiny and bright. The report concludes that while Australia is \"uniquely placed\" to benefit from digital disruption because of the strength of its service industry and education system, and its proximity to Asia's growing digital markets, Australia will only be able to successfully deal with the disruption technology will bring to the workplace if it is \"embedded in the DNA of society\".", "question": "Almost 40 % of Australian jobs that exist today could disappear in the next 10 to 15 years @placeholder to advances in digital technology .", "option_0": "thanks", "option_1": "promises", "option_2": "opportunities", "option_3": "prior", "option_4": "welcome"}

And, with 73% of users selecting a formation with four defenders, and 65% picking a team with two forwards, that's the way our team have to line up. Of the 10 goalkeepers available to choose from, De Gea was the clear choice, being selected in 30% of all teams. He was the 12th most-popular selection overall, but we cannot justify putting the 11th - Coutinho - in goal, so De Gea gets the nod. Thibaut Courtois was the next most-popular keeper, with Sunderland's Jordan Pickford ahead of Hugo Lloris of Tottenham. Thirteen goalkeepers made more saves than De Gea this season (74) but the Spaniard can boast a 72% save percentage. Burnley's Tom Heaton made the most saves all season (141), but he was picked by just 11% of you. Four defenders were a distance clear of the pack - Chelsea trio David Luiz, Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta joined by Tottenham centre-back Toby Alderweireld. Alonso has played most of the season as a wing-back, with Azpilicueta in a back three, but they were most often picked at full-back. Alderweireld was picked in 58% of teams, more than 12% more than any other defender. He is one of five players to appear in more than half the teams picked. Azpilicueta was the only player to play in all 30 of Chelsea's league wins this season, keeping the most clean sheets (16) into the bargain. Spurs full-back Kyle Walker was the fifth most-popular defender but still misses out by a large margin. In a midfield four, three of the selections were obvious. Tottenham's Dele Alli was the most-selected player in any position, with 77% of teams containing the England man. An overwhelming majority picked him in midfield and not attack. Alli scored more goals (18) than any other midfielder this season. Chelsea duo Eden Hazard and player of the year N'Golo Kante were not far behind, with the Belgian making 72% of the teams and Kante 70%. Hazard's selections were split between midfield and attack, but only 20% of people played him in a front three, so he plays on the wing. Yes, Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez would have a bit of settling-in to do on the right wing - and his selection is problematic. Coutinho was the fourth most-selected midfielder, but Sanchez was the ninth most-selected player overall, chosen in 7% more teams than the Liverpool man. He has to play somewhere. Confused? Well BBC Sport users picked Sanchez across midfield and attack, and with a 4-4-2 formation already decided, the Chilean is doing a job wide right. From a statistical point of view, Manchester City man Kevin de Bruyne may consider himself unlucky to miss out. The Belgian had more assists (18) and created more big chances (24) than any other midfielder, but only made it into 24% of teams. He was the sixth most-popular midfielder, just behind another unfortunate player, Spurs' Christian Eriksen. He scored seven goals in the last four days of the season, 29 in total in the league including four hat-tricks, and was picked by 77% of users. Harry Kane was a shoo-in. In fact it may be easier to ask who the 23% who left him out were. Kane was in more than double the teams featuring Lukaku, who was still a long way clear of Sanchez, the third most-popular forward. Sergio Aguero scored more goals in all competitions (33) this season than before for Manchester City, but made just 9% of teams. He was only the seventh most-popular forward.

{"id": 1725, "article": "The referendum was triggered by the Eurosceptic movement which used a new law designed to promote democracy to force a vote by gathering enough signatures on a petition. From the start, activists said this was a chance for voters in the country to express frustration at the EU, in particular what they see as its desire to expand despite democratic shortcomings. Although the turnout was only narrowly above the 30%  required to validate the result it has been hailed as a significant Eurosceptic victory. One \"No\" campaigner at a results party in Amsterdam described it as a \"slap in the face of the European monster\". In the UK Brexit activists were quick to claim the result showed anti-EU sentiment is growing despite the fact two-thirds of Dutch voters chose not to participate. While a vote in the Netherlands may not widely shape public opinion in the UK, it will embolden those campaigning for the UK to leave the EU. They will argue this result proves public concern over sovereignty and accountability is shared beyond Britain. But Netherlands voters were not asked to simply pass judgement on the EU, and throughout the campaign those promoting a \"Yes\" vote were frustrated by what they saw as attempts by Eurosceptics to hijack a debate which should have been about relations between Ukraine, Russia and Europe. Some say the multiple layers to this referendum means the result cannot be seen as a true reflection of the scale of euroscepticism in the Netherlands. Nonetheless the country is traditionally a stronghold of European integration, and the rejection of this deal will rattle the nerves of European leaders who are already struggling to maintain unity in the face of economic instability and the migrant crisis. The impact of this on the Ukraine agreement is not yet clear. Although the referendum was not binding, Prime Minister Mark Rutte signalled the result would not be ignored and he would now open discussions with EU leaders about how to proceed.

{"id": 1726, "article": "The Massachusetts team found shining a strobe light into rodents' eyes encouraged protective cells to gobble up the harmful proteins that accumulate in the brain in this type of dementia. The perfect rate of flashes was 40 per second - a barely perceptible flicker, four times as fast as a disco strobe. The researchers say the approach should be tested in humans. They are already seeking permission from the US regulator, the Food and Drugs Administration, and have set up a commercial company to develop the technology. Build-up of beta amyloid protein is one of the earliest changes seen in the brain in Alzheimer's disease. It clumps together to form sticky plaques and is thought to cause nerve cell death and memory loss. Researchers have been looking for ways to prevent plaque formation using drugs, but the results have been disappointing. But Dr Li-Huei Tsai and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology think they have found another way, using light. The mice that they studied were genetically engineered to have Alzheimer's-type damage in their brain, Nature journal reports. When the mice were put in front of the flashing light for an hour, it led to a noticeable reduction in beta amyloid over the next 12 to 24 hours in the parts of the brain that handle vision. Doing this every day for a week led to even greater reductions. Likewise, light stimulation direct to the part of the brain that deals with memory - the hippocampus - led to reductions of beta amyloid there. The researchers say the light works by recruiting the help of resident immune cells called microglia. Microglia are scavengers. They eat and clear harmful or threatening pathogens - in this instance, beta amyloid. It is hoped that clearing beta amyloid and stopping more plaques from forming could halt Alzheimer's and its symptoms. Dr Tsai said: \"We are optimistic.\" The scientists say, in the future, people could wear special goggles or sit in front of a light-emitting device to get a therapeutic dose of the strobe light. For the patient, it should be entirely painless and non-invasive. \"We can use a very low intensity, very ambient soft light. \"You can hardly see the flicker itself. \"The set-up is not offensive at all,\" they said, stressing it should be safe and would not trigger epilepsy in people who were susceptible. Dr David Reynolds, of Alzheimer's Research, UK said: \"Studies like this are valuable in revealing new processes implicated in Alzheimer's disease and opening new avenues for further research. \"While mice used in this study showed some key features of Alzheimer's, it is always important to follow up these findings in people.\" Follow Michelle on Twitter", "question": "A flashing light therapy might help ward off Alzheimer 's , say US scientists after @placeholder trials in mice .", "option_0": "learning", "option_1": "promising", "option_2": "impressed", "option_3": "emerged", "option_4": "thriving"}

Can the Dons buck the trend in their third round Europa League qualifier, or will the Purples from Styria continue their good run of form? Marcos Tavares scored the vital away goal at Levski Sofia to set up a trip to Pittodrie and the Maribor captain will be a familiar name since the 32-year-old Brazilian featured against Hibs, Rangers and Celtic. Goalkeeper Jasmin Handanovic is another old hand, but defender Marko Suler and forward Damjan Bohar are the only other players in last week's line-up that were involved against Celtic in 2014. That triumph against Celtic took Maribor into the Champions League group phase for the second time, while the win over Rangers in 2011 started a sequence of three successive group campaigns in the Europa League. But Aberdeen fans should note that last season was not a great success for Slovenian's leading team since they were eliminated from Champions League qualifying by Astana, the Kazakh side with which Celtic are currently locking horns, and were beaten to their domestic title for the first time in five seasons. Hibs were simply blown away in the first leg of this third-round qualifier in the Europa League, with Josip Ilicic, who would later move to Palermo and Fiorentina, scoring twice and Tavares banging in a third. The visitors adopted a defensive strategy, leaving striker Derek Riordan and Anthony Stokes on the bench, but could do little to stem the slick Maribor attacks. Maribor quickly snuffed out any hopes of an unlikely Hibs comeback at Easter Road, with that man Tavares knocking in a header after 20 minutes. Edwin De Graaf scored a brace on his Hibs debut, either side of a Dejan Mezga penalty and another strike from Tavares. The first leg began well for Rangers in Slovenia, with a Kirk Broadfoot cross diverted in for an own goal, but Agim Ibraimi, now at Astana, fired past Allan McGregor seven minutes after the break. A fine second-half display from the hosts was rewarded with a clever back-heel finish from Atien Velikonja in stoppage-time. Handanovic, now 38, played a blinder at Ibrox as Rangers squandered several good chances, with Dalibor Volas plundering an away goal. Carlos Bocanegra levelled, but Handanovic made a series of late saves to see his side through. Reinstated to Champions League qualifying after Legia Warsaw fielded an ineligible player, Celtic looked on course to make the most of their good fortune when Callum McGregor scored early in Slovenia. The visitors were quickly pegged back by a well-taken Damjan Bohar equaliser, while Handanovic and opposite number Craig Gordon were kept busy in a game littered with goal-scoring chances. The pick of those opportunities fell to Virgil van Dijk, with the Celtic defender's header blocked on the goal-line by the face of team-mate Stefan Johansen. The return leg in Glasgow was a completely different story, with Celtic blunt in attack and Maribor dictating possession. Zeljko Filipovic, who moved to Belgian club Mechelen this summer, was stand-out in the middle of the park and Tavares again proved the danger man, forcing a shot past Gordon after 75 minutes.

Vote Leave dismissed what it called a \"hastily cobbled together re-launch\".

In other campaign developments: The Remain campaign believes Labour voters are crucial to winning the referendum, but it is concerned that many may not turn out to vote - or may support Brexit. In a speech in Leicester, Mr Brown - whose late intervention in the Scottish independence referendum was considered an influential factor by some observers - sought to galvanise Labour support for the EU. He said action on the environment, cutting energy bills, enhancing workers' rights and social standards, and tackling tax havens were all best achieved by being inside the EU. And he argued the challenges of globalisation meant greater co-operation between countries was needed. This issue covers energy availability and environmental protections. \"That is going to be the lesson we have got to learn from this debate in this referendum - that the EU is not the cause of the problem, but if you can get co-operation working, the EU can be part of the solution to the problem,\" he said. Mr Brown said there was a need to \"show we can manage globalisation better\" and \"balance the autonomy that people want with the co-operation we need\", adding: \"That is what the EU is about.\" He said the UK would be \"in pole position\" to champion change when it takes the rotating presidency of the EU in 2017, if it votes to stay in the EU. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor It might pain me to say it, but plenty of political interventions that we report on go unnoticed. That's why this afternoon, talking to interested members of the public - not all Labour voters but interested parties nonetheless - who had turned up to hear the former PM Gordon Brown speak, it was striking that unprompted many of them mentioned they thought he might \"do a Scotland\". Read more from Laura Mr Brown said Labour's agenda for Remain was a \"positive\" one, that showed \"the benefits that will come from staying part of the European Union\". \"It shows that the Labour Party can work at great strength when we all work together,\" he added. Ahead of his speech, he told BBC Radio 4's Today: \"The Labour voters that I talk to don't like the status quo... They want to know that they are going to be better off, and that's the message I can put.\" He also defended current levels of immigration, and said fears over the impact on local communities would be better addressed by increasing investment in stretched public services than ending free movement rights. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. A study by think tank Migration Watch, that wants lower immigration, has forecast net migration would run at more than a quarter of a million a year for at least 20 years if Britain stayed in the EU. Mr Brown insisted \"illegal immigration\" was the biggest problem the UK faced, and said the only way to tackle it was from within the EU, with cross-border co-operation. Ex-Tory cabinet minister and Vote Leave campaigner Iain Duncan Smith said Labour was \"lecturing\" rather than listening to its own supporters over immigration. Traditional Labour voters were \"pretty disgusted\" with the party over its pro-EU stance, he said and added: \"The number one thing they want is migration brought under control and Labour has nothing to say on that matter.\" At a separate event on Monday, shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn acknowledged there was widespread unease among many traditional Labour communities about the impact of immigration.

That was a great disappointment to him, that he couldn't engage with these guys.\" But what strikes Prof Heilbron about the letters to Margrethe, whom Bohr married the following year, is the intellectual character of their exchanges. \"The material concerning literature - which is essentially the core of this new correspondence - consists of their making personae of one another derived from literature. \"We have in the case of Margrethe her appearance as several heroines from Ibsen, there are all these Dickens heroines, whereas Bohr is to her some hero as in a Carlyle story, but also people from Shakespeare and other heroic figures. \"In a way, their courtship is conducted on a level above the carnal.\" The letters will be excerpted in a forthcoming book by Prof Heilbron and Finn Aaserud of the Niels Bohr Archive, titled Love, Literature and the Quantum Atom.

The differences will be most apparent to visitors of the desktop site: the biggest being that, while previously many stories were shown as part of a list of headlines, now more of the content has an accompanying image and stories are more spaced out on the page. The new layouts are designed to take account of the wider screens used by desktop computers, allowing us to present a richer experience for you as you visit the main sport and football pages. They also feature new scores and league tables, designed to provide the same experience you can find in our coverage elsewhere on the site.

In a report presented at Flax Bourton Coroners' Court, the BSAB said he died because his mental health history was \"overlooked\" and his risky anti-social behaviour was not seen as a symptom of his psychiatric condition. The inquest heard Mr Crane had cooked on barbecues with liquid gas, because his gas and electricity supplies had been cut off. In the six months before his death, firefighters were called to his flat in Carolina House in Dove Street, Kingsdown, four times after neighbours reported he was lighting fires, the inquest heard. It was also told Mr Crane had been treated in hospital for a bipolar disorder, in 2012. The safeguarding report found Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health partnership (AWP) failed to see his \"risky and chaotic lifestyle\" was a symptom of his underlying mental disorder. AWP felt his anti-social behaviour was \"down to choice - rather than a symptom of his condition\", the report stated.

Yeovil have won eight and drawn five of their 16 league games in 2016 since Way was officially appointed, after a six-game spell as interim boss following the departure of Paul Sturrock. Media playback is not supported on this device \"Everyone likes him,\" Tozer told BBC Somerset. \"It's incredible the amount of work he has put in to get to where we are. \"You can tell with the way we play for him and work for him. \"When we came in one day, there was green tape everywhere, a horizontal line of green tape.

His career, which included 273 appearances for Yeovil, was ended after a car crash in February 2010 and he subsequently joined the club's coaching team. On his new contract, Way told BBC Somerset: \"The only thing that changes for me is I was a new manager and now I'm a manager. \"It's a proud moment.

The family, from Ouston, were going to a dance competition. The Grimsby stretch of the A18 featured in a BBC television programme, Britain's Killer Roads, in 2011. The family were killed after their car collided with a lorry. During an inquest at Cleethorpes Town Hall, Coroner Paul Kelly called for North East Lincolnshire Council and their contractors to start an independent review of the A18 between Laceby roundabout and the authority boundary. The inquest heard evidence that opportunities were missed to fix a defect in the road. Mr Kelly said: \"The gully was well formed, established and a hazard to road users.\" Recording a narrative verdict, he added: \"In the meantime the road has continued to deteriorate. I do not have confidence in the contractor or authority.\" As part of his recommendations he also asked Humberside Police to review within 56 days the way the force report road hazards. A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said that as a result of the accident the authority and its partner, Cofely, was \"rolling out, measures designed to detect and repair defects similar to those involved in this incident\".

They died along with al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Farouq. Pakistan said in a statement that \"having lost thousands of innocent civilians in the war against terrorism\" it fully understood \"this tragic loss and stands with\" the families of the two hostages. \"The death of Mr Weinstein and Mr Lo Porto in a drone strike demonstrates the risk and unintended consequences of the use of this technology that Pakistan has been highlighting for a long time,\" the statement added. American drone strikes in Pakistan's tribal belt are extremely unpopular with Pakistanis; many view them as violation of their country's sovereignty.

Mr Obama on Thursday said he took \"full responsibility\" for the operation, which was launched in the belief that the target was an al-Qaeda compound with no civilians present. The White House announced that two other US citizens - thought to be al-Qaeda members - were also killed in drone strikes. Ahmed Farouq was killed in the same raid that caused the deaths of Mr Weinstein and Mr Lo Porto, it said, and Adam Gadahn, once regarded as a spokesman for the militant group, was killed in a separate strike. The BBC has been told that the attack which killed the hostages took place on 15 January in the Dabar Miami area, in the Shawal region of North Waziristan.

Updates on this and other stories in Birmingham Retired GP Peter Cooper was imprisoned for historical sex offences against a girl which began when she was six years old. At the Court of Appeal, their lawyers argued the sentence passed should be one where it could be reasonably expected that the offender will serve the required custodial period. If this was not the case, the jail term was more like a life sentence when the offender had not been sentenced in that way. They wanted the court to treat old people as if they were terminally ill and suggested they were seen as a special class of offender - like those under 18 and the mentally disordered - who are subject to special consideration at sentencing. Refusing their appeals, five judges, led by Lady Justice Hallett, said working on a case-by-case basis would continue. \"Whilst we consider that an offender's diminished life expectancy, his age, health and the prospect of dying in prison are factors legitimately to be taken into account in passing sentence, they have to be balanced against the gravity of the offending - including the harm done to victims - and the public interest in setting appropriate punishment for very serious crimes.\" The sentences of \"relatively sprightly\" Clarke and Cooper were not excessive, the judges ruled.", "question": "Two paedophiles aged 101 and 96 have lost their appeals against sentences which they claimed were excessive because of their @placeholder old age .", "option_0": "perceived", "option_1": "upcoming", "option_2": "extreme", "option_3": "latest", "option_4": "major"}

The SYHA said the selling agents have received notes of interest and these were being considered. The castle, which overlooks the Kyle of Sutherland, was shut as a hostel after suffering frost damage. Historic Scotland lists the castle and its entrance gates as category B, which means they are structures of regional importance. The Dowager Duchess of Sutherland had Carbisdale Castle built between 1907 and 1917 following the death of her husband, George Granville William Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, the Third Duke of Sutherland. Lady Mary was the duke's second wife and after he died she became embroiled in a legal dispute over his will with her step son, the fourth Duke of Sutherland. When the row was settled the duchess used her inheritance to have Carbisdale constructed. According to geographical encyclopaedia, The Gazetteer of Scotland, the property became known as the Castle of Spite. Its clock tower only has three faces with none that could be seen by the new duke as he passed by in his private train on his way to Dunrobin Castle, near Golspie, his family's property in Sutherland. It is also said that he would have the blinds of his carriage shut so he did not have to look at Carbisdale. The castle was bought by a Scots-Norwegian family in 1933 and was used as a refuge for the Norwegian royal family during World War II.

However, Mr Noonan said that despite the downgrade, the Irish economy was in good shape, growing strongly and should continue to grow over the coming years. The finance minister told the D¨¢il, the Irish parliament, that the only tax increase was 50 cents on cigarettes, taking the price of a packet of 20 to 11 euros (¡ê10). He said the government was introducing \"economic shock absorbers\" and announced plans to establish a \"rainy day fund\" of up to a billion euros per year when the Irish budget goes into surplus in 2018. \"Whatever the final settlement, what we know with certainty is that Brexit has increased risk to the Irish economy and, as well as introducing specific measures to assist particular sectors of the economy, we must also put in place safety nets to protect us against future economic shocks,\" he said.

The main route to Shell Island - one of the biggest campsites in Europe - is via a causeway which is cut off by the tide twice a day, every other week.

{"id": 1775, "article": "The most famous Freud was Sigmund, the figurehead of the family, and one of the great thinkers in modern history. As founder of the discipline of psychoanalysis, he created an entirely new approach to understanding - and treating - the unconscious mind. But since his death in 1939, his offspring to this day have carried on the family name to great heights in a variety of fields. In politics, David Freud - now Lord Freud - is the current parliamentary undersecretary of state for work and pensions, while Matthew Freud is an influential public relations chief who is married to Elisabeth Murdoch, daughter of media mogul Rupert. In the arts, Lucian Freud's heritage lives on with his daughters Bella and Esther, who are famed for being a highly-regarded fashion designer and novelist respectively. Another prominent family member no longer with us was Sir Clement, Sigmund's grandson who had a varied career as a culinary expert, humorist, columnist, broadcaster and Liberal MP. But the Freuds are not the only family whose achievements put the average family to shame. There is the Redgrave acting dynasty, headed by Michael, his  children Vanessa, Corin and Lynn and grandchildren Jemma Redgrave and Natasha and Joely Richardson. In the US, political dynasties have become the norm - headed of course by the Kennedy and Bush families. But the Freuds are unusual in that their achievements are in such a wide range of fields. According to Ivan Ward, deputy director of the Freud Museum, this may be because of the ideas first espoused by Sigmund Freud and his belief in independent thought as well as the importance of being told from an early age that you are special. Sigmund, who was Jewish, lived in Austria, which came under Nazi rule after being annexed by Germany in 1938. He, his wife and youngest daughter were forced to flee their Vienna home to London after being targeted by the Nazis. His four sisters, who stayed behind, later died in concentration camps. Lucian's painting of a woman on a sofa set a record price for a living artist when it sold for $33.6m (?¡ê21m) Painter Lucian Freud dies aged 88 Obituary: Lucian Freud In pictures: Lucian Freud According to Mr Ward, the sense of conflict of living in opposition was something which inspired Sigmund's independence of thought. \"The upheaval of having to leave Vienna, and the Holocaust where four of his sisters died in concentration camps - all those things would have had an impact,\" he said. \"He was the oldest boy, and his mother used to call him the 'golden child', so there was a sense of being the favourite and the oldest boy in a Jewish family pushed him on to his achievements. \"How it gets transmitted to following generations is hard to say.\" As a father, Sigmund was \"tolerant and encouraged creativity and the ability to think\", said Mr Ward. \"Try and picture the scene of Freud with his children when they were small; he's trying to establish himself and he's struggling and working all hours.. it's hard to say he spent a lot of time with his children, he probably didn't. \"But you get the feeling that when he did, he treated them with a seriousness and complexity that some people don't think about when it comes to relating to children.\" And in Sigmund's own words: \"If a man has been his mother's undisputed darling, he retains throughout life the triumphant feeling; the confidence in success, which not seldom brings actual success along with it.\" But do genetics play a role in a family's success? Marcus Pembrey, a professor of paediatric genetics at University College London, said that although genetics can influence things like intelligence, it does not do it directly. \"Genetic differences between genes make them highly responsive to environment but whether this is a good thing depends on the environment,\" he said. \"If it's one where there's underachievement then they will adopt that and achieve nothing, so it works for better and worse.\" He said the Freuds probably have genes which are highly responsive to the environment around them so as their family is full of people who have distinctive achievements, children in the early years of development pick up on this. Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology and director of the department of twin research at King's College in London, argues that genetics do have a role to play in success but not usually in the same profession. \"Identical twins rarely succeed in the same fields,\" he said. \"For success, you need a basic minimal IQ - which is 60% genetic - but also the environment which usually includes a role model and teacher or family to drive you. \"You also need motivation and the will to practise hard from an early age. These traits are partly genetic but can be improved with training.\" According to family relationship therapist Julia Armstrong, the first seven years are key times in a person's development as things such as parents, friendships and schooling all have an impact. \"If at that point a person is given the permission to shine, there is a natural expectation that life is going to offer opportunities. \"We've all got the capacity to be whatever we want to be, and nature depends on that being encouraged, so if a child's preference or talent is recognised, then they are more likely to grow into their creative self.\" She said a child in a successful family can go in one of two directions - they can excel once they discover what their own talent may be, or they can feel the pressure and go the other way and not live up to expectations.", "question": "The art world has been @placeholder the death of Lucian Freud , arguably one of the UK 's most highly regarded and respected artists .

A report from the committee rejected the idea of a single regulator to tackle the issue. It suggested a better solution would be a single point of contact for consumers, combined with more co-operation between existing watchdog bodies. The committee found that a significant cause of nuisance calls was the unfair or even illegal use of personal data. This included obtaining a person's \"consent\" to receive unsolicited marketing calls in ways that were \"at best opaque and at worst dishonest\" and trading personal details with companies which were \"lacking in scruples\". The MPs said the information commissioner \"should use his existing powers to tackle them far more, and should not shy from imposing repeated penalties on companies that are repeat offenders\". The committee recommended a single online form and helpline - clearly advertised on phone bills - for consumers to report cases.

Others have suggested the services would be counter to parts of the Bible that state that humans are created as either male or female. The Church's four-day general synod meeting in York started on Friday. The motion recognised the need for transgender people to be \"welcomed and affirmed\" in their parish church. Chris Newlands, the vicar of Lancaster Priory church, posed the motion as a way of the Church welcoming people who suffer from transphobia in society. Mr Newlands said he would speak on behalf of the transgender community, as there were no transgender people in the synod. He said: \"I hope that we can make a powerful statement that we believe trans people are cherished and loved by God, who created them.\" After the Synod voted for the motion, he added: \"I'm euphoric and exhausted. \"I did think there were some comments which reflect some of the extreme views which we would wish to counter. \"I'm getting so many messages from trans friends around the world.  Synod has changed - we have turned a corner.\" During the debate, lay member Tim Hind, who was supportive of transgender people, argued that the motion would make the Church look \"foolish\". An amendment to the motion asking bishops to consider the theological, pastoral and other issues around gender transition, was rejected. A transgender liturgical service would not be a second baptism, however, as the Church's teaching is that humans are made in the image of God - transcending gender - and baptism takes place only once. The Archbishop of York, the Most Reverend John Sentamu, said that \"theology has to be done\" by the House of Bishops, but \"it can be done very quickly\". During an earlier debate, the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Reverend Paul Bayes, said: \"As the world listens to us today, the world needs to hear us say that LGBTI orientation and identity is not a crime, not a sickness and not a sin.\" Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, said the Church would spend three years on a document outlining a new stance on sexuality.

They included using virtual environments to visualise how movie sets would look before they were built - including creating virtual representations of actors in the scene. However, Mr Bredow was hesitant to suggest VR would be the future of movies, cautiously suggesting that current hardware was not \"comfortable enough\". \"I wonder if a 360-degree movie is going to be compelling enough as its own medium,\" he added. \"We haven't solved all the things we need to solve.\" Facebook bought Oculus VR, the company behind the Oculus Rift headset, for $2bn (?¡ê1.3bn) in March last year.

{"id": 1808, "article": "Researchers at Australia's Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), just outside Townsville, Queensland, in north-east Australia, have mapped the pattern of destruction. \"Coral cover is half of what it was 27 years ago, coral cover is going down at an alarming rate.\" Dr Katharina Fabricius, coral reef ecologist and AIMS principal research scientist, told the BBC World Service programme Discovery. She said the biggest culprit was the Crown of Thorns Starfish (COTs). \"There are three main sources for the coral decline, one is storms, however 42% is attributed to Crown of Thorns Starfish - and just 10% due to bleaching. This compares with 70% due to bleaching for reefs elsewhere in the world , such as in the Caribbean.\" Bleaching occurs when corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients. They expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely white. Australian scientists are now looking at ways to reduce the destruction wreaked by starfish, which have the ability to smother coral and digest the fleshy parts. \"Crown of thorns are amazing creatures, they can grow to larger than a dinner plate they have multiple arms they're covered in spines,\" said Craig Humphrey, manager of the AIMS SEASIM project, the world's largest marine environment simulator. \"They go onto a coral, invert their stomach and dissolve and digest the coral tissue.\" The SEASIM team is running a series of experiments on COTs to look at ways of lessening their impact on coral. There have always been COTs outbreaks: go into the fossil record and you can find the spines of COTs throughout geological history. But while outbreaks have occurred over many years, they now seem to be increasingly in frequency - and nutrients from land-based agriculture are the probable culprit. \"The conjecture is the agricultural practice has reduced the time between COT outbreaks,\" said Mr Humphrey. \"At a point north of Townsville, you'll get an initial outbreak then you'll see waves of COTs spreading down the reef, and they'll consume massive amounts of coral - they do massive damage. \"We've held COTs here on restrictive diets, but you put them into a tank with coral and within 12 hours they'll have consumed all the tissue on that coral.\" Excess fertiliser from agriculture, in Queensland particularly from sugar cane farming, is leached into rivers which then run into the sea, taking these concentrated nutrients to the reef. The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is on a continental shelf, which contributes to the problem, acting as a barrier to the further dispersal of nutrients from the land. \"The GBR is having a higher nutrient status because of what's coming down the rivers - and the main cause of the runoff is agriculture, contributing nutrients to the system at rates that are probably six to 10 times higher than in pre-industrial times,\" said Dr Fabricius. John Brodie is team leader of the Catchment to Reef Processes Research Group at James Cook University. He explains that historically only a tiny proportion of COT larvae survived to adulthood - but the agricultural nutrients are changing that. \"Crown of Thorns are very fecund animals: each female can produce between five and 20 million eggs per animal - so a lot of eggs. \"The larvae drift in the water for about five weeks and eat phytoplankton.\" In just the same way that algal blooms have been created in other parts of the world, in Queensland an increase in the amount of agricultural nutrients in the seawater has led to a vast increase in the amount of phytoplankton - which the COT larvae need to survive. As Mr Brodie explains: \"What have we done, we've pumped a whole lot of nutrients in, we've increased the amount of phytoplankton enormously at just the right time of year, so instead of 0.0001% of the larvae surviving, now 10 times as much survives. \"Usually we have tiny number of larvae surviving, now we've got big numbers - 10 million eggs per female - so each reef might have a million animals, so now you're talking about five trillion in the water at a time, the numbers are extraordinary.\" Mr Brodie has been working with Queensland's sugar cane farmers to try and reduce the amount of fertiliser entering the sea. He seems to be having some success, reducing levels by 2-3% by suggesting to them that using less fertiliser will save them money and help protect the recreational fisheries that they use.", "question": "Waves of carnivorous starfish are eating their way through Australia 's Great Barrier Reef - and sugar cane farming is being @placeholder .", "option_0": "reminded", "option_1": "developed", "option_2": "blamed", "option_3": "solved", "option_4": "resumed"}

Juliet Thomas and Natasha Sawkins want their proud peers to post their success under #IAmAnEssexGirl and sign their petition to have the term scrubbed. But, a dictionary spokeswoman said, \"nothing is ever taken out of the OED\". \"It's a historical dictionary,\" she told the BBC. \"Definitions can change, but an entry will never come out.\" The dictionary defines Essex girl as: \"Essex girl  n.  [after Essex man n.] Brit. derogatory a contemptuous term applied (usu. joc.) to a type of young woman, supposedly to be found in and around Essex, and variously characterized as unintelligent, promiscuous, and materialistic.\" The campaigners were further peeved by a Collins definition that added: \"devoid of taste\". Juliet Thomas told the BBC: \"It's so rude and it doesn't define anyone I know in or from Essex. It describes a very dated stereotype.\" The alternative meaning of just a girl in or from Essex was absent, she said. And it was \"incredibly offensive\" to see it in the dictionary with no reference to caricature. She wants women to sign the petition with the aim of having the entry removed and to post their successes and support on social media to \"redefine\" what it means to be an Essex girl. Among those who have backed the campaign, novelist Amanda Prowse tweeted her support and theatre technician Emily Holden tweeted: \"I have a BA (hons) degree... I help put on awesome work. \" Ms Thomas said women, particularly young women, were still having to fight the Essex girl stereotype years after the term was coined. \"Girls feel they still have to listen to the same tired old jokes, feel like they have to fight twice as hard to be taken seriously at university,\" she said. \"It's tricky and disappointing to see it in writing in an official way. It reinforces it.\" Ms Thomas said programmes such as scripted-reality soap opera The Only Way is Essex existed for other parts of the UK as well and shouldn't be allowed to define the women of an entire county.

Only 20,869 of the 160,000 refugees have so far been relocated in the EU. The three states could be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and eventually face heavy fines. The relocation plan was conceived in response to the large influx of migrants and refugees in 2015, in an attempt to relieve pressure on frontline states, mainly Greece and Italy, where the vast majority of migrants were arriving. EU countries agreed to relocate 160,000 asylum-seekers between them - though Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary voted against accepting mandatory quotas. Hungary and Slovakia challenged the quota last month in the ECJ. While the UK and Ireland were exempt from the original 2015 proposal, Poland's previous government backed the plan, although its current Eurosceptic administration has since rejected it. The Czech Republic has accepted only 12 of the 2,000 it had been designated, while Hungary and Poland have received none. \"I regret to see that despite our repeated calls to pledge to relocate, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland have not yet taken the necessary action,\" Mr Avramopoulos, told journalists. \"For this reason, the Commission has decided to launch infringement procedures against these three member states. I sincerely hope that these member states can still reconsider their position and contribute fairly.\" But Poland has already signalled it will not fall into line with the quota. \"Each decision to relocate groups of migrants encourages thousands or millions more at the borders of Europe, to come to Europe, to get on boats and pontoons and risk their lives to reach the European continent,\" said Polish government spokesman Rafal Bochenek. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka stressed that his country too would not take part either, \"with regard to the worsened security situation in Europe and dysfunctionality of the quota system\".

A presidential veto can, in turn, be overridden by a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate - where just a handful of politicians voted against the bill.

Mr Trump has repeatedly denied the existence of any Russian involvement in the election to help his campaign.

The White House is also said to be particularly concerned over a provision in the new bill which would limit President Trump's ability to lift the sanctions.

But those who do not - says Unison - will typically lose more than ¡ê50 a week. A couple over the age of 25, with no children, earning the National Living Wage for 30 hours a week, would be ¡ê2,756 a year better off if they register for tax credits before they transfer onto UC, according to Unison. \"If low-paid workers sign up to tax credits, not only will they be better off now, but their income will also be protected in future, unless there is a significant change in their circumstances,\" said Dave Prentis, Unison's general secretary. The Chancellor, George Osborne, originally decided to cut both tax credits and the UC equivalent, work allowances. But after a Conservative party revolt in the autumn of 2015, he decided not to cut tax credits. That left cuts to work allowances unchanged. For example, until now a single parent with no housing costs has been able to earn ¡ê8,808 a year before his or her UC payments were affected.

Nevertheless, Mr Javid said China is \"committing to do something about it and I think that's a very positive step forward\".

This is a global problem which requires a global solution to remove current over-capacity and time is a luxury we don't have.\" He called on China to take the same radical action that European steel producers had embraced. Earlier, China's official news agency said that blaming the country for the global steel industry's problems was a \"lame and lazy excuse for protectionism\". Xinhua said in an English-language commentary piece: \"Blaming other countries is always an easy, sure-fire way for politicians to whip up a storm over domestic economic woes, but finger-pointing and protectionism are counter-productive. The last thing the world needs is a trade war over this issue. Far more jobs will be lost than gained if protectionism prevails.\" EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem told the meeting the steel crisis was \"now life or death for many companies\", but that tariffs were \"only a short-term bandage\", adding: \"Healing the sector's wounds requires sustained international cooperation leading to effective reform.\" The internal market and industry commissioner, Elzbieta Bienkowska, said the European Union should consider allowing member nations to subsidise their steel industries. \"We have to discuss whether we can't be more flexible in our judgment of state aid,\" she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \"We cannot push this industry any further.\" 63.7bn tonnes in 2015 67.5% used in 2015 70.9% used in 2014 The steel crisis has put thousands of UK jobs under threat at plants including Port Talbot in south Wales.

On Wednesday, Hamas-affiliated members of the Palestinian parliament announced they had approved a measure allowing executions to be carried out in Gaza without having first been ratified by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is based in the West Bank. \"We found it was important to implement the death penalty rule to maintain civil peace in society and to prevent cases of murder,\" Hamas MP Yehia Mousa told the New York Times. It was not clear what authority the MPs had to authorise executions in the coastal territory, given that the full Palestinian Legislative Council has not met since Hamas reinforced its power in Gaza in 2007 following a violent rift with Mr Abbas' Fatah movement. But the move came a week after Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said 13 Palestinians had been sentenced to death by courts in Gaza and would be executed as soon as possible. Last month, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) said a military court had sentenced three men to death for collaborating with Israel. That took the total number of death sentences issued so far this year in Gaza to 10, it added. The Hamas authorities mostly stopped carrying out the death penalty in June 2014, when a government of national consensus was formed and officially placed in charge of Gaza. However, that government never exercised authority there and, in July 2015, it was reshuffled without Hamas' inclusion or input. In February, Hamas' military wing executed one of its commanders \"for behavioural and moral violations\". Mahmoud Eshtewi was accused of theft and of having sex with another man, the New York Times reported. In a briefing to the UN Security Council, Mr Mladenov stressed that international law limited the application of the death penalty to the \"most serious crimes\" and pursuant to a trial and appeals process that scrupulously follow fair trial standards. \"I have serious doubts as to whether capital trials in Gaza meet these standards,\" he said. \"There are also disturbing media reports indicating that the sentences could be carried out in public.

{"id": 1842, "article": "In fact there could be periods of turbulence over the coming years before touchdown. The government-commissioned Airports Commission, led by Sir Howard Davies, last summer recommended construction of a third airstrip at Heathrow, and this proposal has now been backed by the government. The plan involves building a new 3,500m runway about two miles north of the two runways Heathrow already has, at an estimated cost of ¡ê17.6bn. So what will actually happen next and what does it mean for travellers? Heathrow says it expects the new runway to be open in 2025 - with the planning process dealt with by 2020, then four years to build the runway itself and another year to attend to the surrounding infrastructure needed. The airport say its expansion timetable has factored in the possibility of the runway decision going to a judicial review. And that looks a likely possibility given the bodies lined up to make a legal protest, including local councils, plus community and environmental groups. Indeed, the prime minister's local council has said it will spend ¡ê50,000 to challenge Heathrow expansion. Windsor and Maidenhead Council, in Theresa May's constituency, has teamed up with Hillingdon, Richmond and Wandsworth councils to fight the expansion. Overall, the four councils have pledged ¡ê200,000 towards a legal challenge. Residents' organisation Teddington Action Group (TAG) also says it is committed to launching legal proceedings. It says one of the key grounds for a judicial review into the expansion decision is the \"apparent bias\" of Sir Howard Davies, relating to his past roles at GIC Private Ltd, owner of an 11.9% share in Heathrow Airport Holdings. Heathrow chosen for expansion with third runway Airport expansion: the cost of delays Given this potential for legal hold-ups, the Independent's travel editor Simon Calder says, \"I wouldn't book a ticket for the opening ceremony just yet.\" And it is not just legal challenges that could cause delays. Despite today's announcement it could be two years before a final \"final\" decision, thanks to convoluted parliamentary and planning processes. And there are those who think two years is the absolute minimum and that in reality it could take at least four years. Heathrow envisages a three-runway airport providing up to 740,000 flights a year, up from the current 480,000. \"What is interesting is what happens in terms of expanding capacity,\" says Mr Calder. \"We are not going to get all the airlines just suddenly saying, 'We have another 50% more aircraft here.' There is going to have to be a gradual building up of their capacity.\" To handle the increased numbers, a new terminal building 6 will be built alongside the new runway, while Mr Calder adds that existing terminals 5 and 2 could process more passengers than they do at present. \"For most people the flying experience out of Heathrow will not change much,\" he says. \"It may be that there will be less waiting time before boarding. \"There will obviously be the new terminal building near to the third runway.  And there will need to be some new infrastructure in order for passengers to connect to this terminal. \"Where there should be noticeable change though is for incoming passengers - there will certainly be much less time holding in the air before landing.\" Once passengers land, there will also need to be extra public transport infrastructure in place at an expanded Heathrow. The airport has plans for two main passenger transport hubs - Heathrow West (Terminals 5 and 6) and Heathrow East (an extended Terminal 2) - connected by an underground passenger transport and baggage system. Current transport routes which could be developed into the enlarged airport include a Heathrow Express extension, and a Great Western Railways service. And Crossrail and Southern rail may also provide transport services into the airport in future. With regards to airlines, British Airways, which has roughly half of all slots at Heathrow, will almost certainly stay in Terminal 5, and the expanded Terminal 2 seems set to remain as the base for airlines that make up the Star Alliance grouping. Meanwhile, Easyjet, which already serves four London airports - Luton, Stansted, Southend and Gatwick - is set to move in and open a new base at Terminal 4. It plans to compete with BA, and has promised to restore some links around the UK - such as to Inverness, the Isle of Man and Jersey. Commission chair Sir Howard Davies has also predicted there could be up to a dozen new long-haul routes out of the expanded Heathrow to important emerging cities in Asia and elsewhere. Meanwhile, Heathrow says that early morning arrivals will end, and it may be that airlines BA, Cathay Pacific and Virgin Atlantic will have to delay their departures from Hong Kong until after midnight so they touch down not earlier than 05:30 in London. At the moment several flights from the Far East arrive before 5am each day. While most of the focus in the run-up to today's decision has been on Heathrow and rival Gatwick, there is also a further regional element in play. A body called Raba (Regional and Business Airports group), which represents smaller regional airports in the UK, has been backing Heathrow expansion. It has been predicting benefits for passengers and companies across the country if the Heathrow plans got the go-ahead. The body points out that in 1990, 18 UK regional airports had regular scheduled flights connecting their regions to Heathrow, but today there are just eight. Indeed, at present Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, not Heathrow, is the main hub airport for flights from UK domestic airports. Raba says that for three years it has been working with the Airports Commission and Heathrow to envisage a new domestic network that will give all parts of the UK access to the expanded Heathrow. \"With an expanded Heathrow, the value of the slots will come down, which will help,\" says Mr Calder. Regional airports will be looking to see two specific things from Heathrow, he says - lower charges for domestic links than for other short-haul flights, and the allocation of extra slots for domestic flights. Meanwhile, who will pay for the new runway to get it up and running roughly a decade from now? Heathrow says the taxpayer will pay ¡ê1.2bn for surface infrastructure that is deemed to benefit the wider travelling public (roads, trains etc) as opposed to just airport users, though the Airports Commission puts this figure at ¡ê5bn and Transport for London estimates the taxpayer will end up paying ¡ê15bn. But it is passengers over the coming years who will face increased charges to pay for most of the airport expansion. There is expected to be an increase in the per-departing-passenger fees Heathrow charges to airlines. It means airlines and passengers operating over the coming years may have to pay for infrastructure that they won't be able to use until 2025. And British Airways chief executive Alex Cruz said if Heathrow \"were to react very quickly saying from 1 January we're going to add ¡ê10 [to airport charges], we wouldn't react very well. \"We would very much oppose such a move.\"", "question": "Heathrow expansion has been in a holding pattern over west London for decades , and confirmation that the UK 's largest airport has been given the go-ahead to build another runway does not necessarily @placeholder its arrival any time soon .", "option_0": "achieved", "option_1": "signal", "option_2": "denying", "option_3": "guarantee", "option_4": "renew"}

{"id": 1848, "article": "As part of a discussion paper on the future of Defined Benefit (DB) pensions, it said financially \"stressed\" companies might be allowed to water down previous promises. About 5% of businesses are in that category, according to the green paper. As many as eleven million people are members of private sector DB schemes, which link pensions to salaries. In particular, some companies might be allowed to adjust the way they up-rate pension payments annually to compensate for inflation. Instead of using the Retail Prices Index (RPI), it could be that some companies would be allowed to use the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) instead, the government said. Since CPI is usually lower than RPI, it would save firms money. However, such a change could cost the average pensioner up to ?¡ê20,000 over the course of their retirement, according to the discussion document. Most public-sector Defined Benefit pensions schemes moved to the CPI measure in 2011. Steve Webb, who was a pensions minister under the Coalition government, said allowing such a change would be worrying. \"There is a significant risk that relaxing standards on inflation protection - with the best of intentions for exceptional cases - could be exploited and lead to millions of retired people being at risk of cuts in their real living standards,\" he said. In the paper, the government also raises the idea of temporarily suspending any sort of inflation indexation at all, when pension schemes are in serious trouble. Yet it admits this could raise \"moral hazard issues\", whereby companies might be tempted to deliberately increase their deficits to save money on pension pay-outs.

Four fences have been rebuilt using softer cores instead of the former rigid timber frame. Two outriders were used on Saturday to help with loose horses during two races over the National fences - the Becher Chase and the Grand Sefton Chase. Both races passed without serious incident and although there were fallers in each, there were no injuries to either horses or jockeys reported. John Baker, the regional director of Jockey Club Racecourses responsible for Aintree, said: \"We were delighted with how the Grand National fences jumped today, including the trial fences, and we had some fantastic feedback from the professionals.\" Jockey Robert \"Choc\" Thornton said on Twitter: \"Great job done by Aintree racecourse and the BHA [British Horseracing Authority] with the fences. They rode great and are well presented.\" Clerk of the course Andrew Tulloch was satisfied with the reaction to the fences. \"They seemed to get some favourable comments back from jockeys and it all went quite well,\" he said. \"We'll be sitting down and having a chat with the jockeys and assessing how we take things forward, if we take things forward, and take it from there.\" Saturday was the first time the course had been used since April when the National had two equine fatalities for the second year in succession. While all 16 fences look the same, covered in spruce brought in from the Lake District, the heart of four obstacles has been changed. The third and 11th fences, which are open ditches, have been built using natural birch as its core, while the 13th and 14th (which are the last two fences second time round in the National) have plastic birch. \"We have traditionally had a rigid timber frame, which has foam padding along the leading edge, but is solid. We have replaced four of those with an alternative, which will be a bit more forgiving,\" Tulloch told BBC Sport. \"If the horse hits something solid at racing speed it can unbalance it and cause a fall, but now if horses knock the spruce off, there will be a softer frame underneath. Other horses should be able to brush through it without injuring themselves. \"If it is successful we will roll it out to the other fences. The fences are outwardly the same. We are not lowering them - that could potentially make the horses go quicker.\" The move has been welcomed by the RSPCA equine consultant David Muir. \"It allows a horse to make a mistake and survive,\" he said. \"Previous to that when they hit the solid core of the fences, it took their legs away and it was down to luck whether they got over the other side and managed to get up again.\" Several changes were announced in September for the Grand National following a safety review, but the field size will stay at a maximum of 40.

They haven't told us where those cuts are going to come.\" While Labour lost overall control of Walsall, it remains the largest party. The Conservatives increased their majority in Solihull and retained control of the councils of Stratford-on-Avon and Rugby in Warwickshire, while they gained control of North Warwickshire Borough Council from Labour and Warwick, which was previously under no overall control. In Coventry, Labour retained control. In Worcester, the Conservatives took 18 of the 35 seats to win the council. Council leader Simon Geraghty said: \"It's fantastic to be able to lead a council with an overall majority once again.\" Herefordshire Council also moved into Conservative control. However, confusion over how many candidates people could vote for has meant the Saxongate ward election has been declared void and there will be a by-election. Bromsgrove, Wyre Forest, Malvern Hills and Wychavon remained Conservative. However, Labour maintained overall control of Redditch despite the Conservatives gaining four seats. On Telford and Wrekin Council, Labour lost overall control but remain the largest party. In Staffordshire, Labour lost control of Stoke-on-Trent. The City Independents, the Conservatives and UKIP may now try to form a coalition. Conservative leader Abi Brown said: \"We are absolutely delighted we have picked up another five seats.\" The Conservatives retained control of Lichfield, Stafford, South Staffordshire and Tamworth and gained control of East Staffordshire and Staffordshire Moorlands. Labour retained control of Cannock Chase, despite losing three seats, while Newcastle-under-Lyme remained under no overall control.

Dai Davies, chairman of HCC, said Wales had led the way in terms of lamb exports, selling more to markets beyond Europe than any other EU region.

Senegal's capital, Dakar, is a regional hub for West Africa and many doctors and medical supplies arriving from Europe or the US would pass through there before going to the affected countries.

On Thursday, a Russian transport plane carrying a mobile lab and team of specialist medics such as virologists and epidemiologists flew to Guinea's capital Conakry.

Previously the highest figure was ¡ê443 in the spring of 2012. The rise comes in spite of government attempts to limit compensation payments and cut court costs. One reason for the increase is a rise in the cost of repairing cars that have been in accidents, because of their increasingly sophisticated electronics. Buying in spare parts is also getting more expensive, due to the weakness of sterling. The average repair bill has risen by 32% over the last three years to ¡ê1,678, the ABI said. The ABI warned that premiums were likely to increase further, if the government went ahead with plans to review the so-called discount rate. When accident victims are given a lump sum in compensation, the sum is discounted to make up for the extra investment return they are likely to receive. Since 2001 the discount rate has been 2.5% - based on investment returns from government bonds. If that rate is reduced, insurance companies will have to pay out more - thus increasing premiums. \"The sudden decision to review the discount rate has the potential to turn a drama into a crisis, with a significant cut throwing fuel on the fire in terms of premiums,\" said Rob Cummings, the ABI's head of motor and liability.

Yet a week or so later, they may feel aggrieved to find places are available to applicants from other parts of the UK. The clearing system is a complex issue. It is far more subtle than a headline claiming a Scot is losing out to someone from England, Wales or Northern Ireland. It is the price of free tuition at Scottish university - a price the policy's supporters would say was worth paying. To put this in context though, the number of places at Scottish universities available to Scots is at an historic high. By this week the number of Scottish applicants accepted to Scottish institutions had reached 30,400 - 4% up on this time last year. However, this may be little consolation to those who have lost out on the course they actually wanted to do. Essentially there are now three groups of students at Scottish universities. This two tier system for Scottish and other UK students is the result of free tuition in Scotland. But universities strongly contend that comparing students in the different categories is like comparing apples with pears. They deny claims Scots are losing out to fee-paying students from elsewhere and say this shows a misunderstanding of the issue. Realistically the only way to end the distinction would be if tuition fees were re-introduced in Scotland or if free tuition was brought back in other parts of the UK. The former would mean Scottish universities would be free to take in as many Scots as they wanted.  The latter could end the distinction in the clearing system. Either would probably mean that there was no hard and fast distinction between Scottish applicants and prospective students from other parts of Britain. Universities Scotland is calling for discussions with the government over the total number of places available to Scots. It would like to see the overall number grow to ensure that more people from disadvantaged areas can get a place without making it harder for others.

A spokesman for the provincial governor said 15 people suspected of collaborating with authorities were beheaded, including women. The Taliban is active in many parts of Ghazni, an important gateway to the capital, Kabul, from the south-east. Fighting is continuing as security forces try to regain the district but officials fear surrounding districts are now vulnerable to attack. Some analysts say that control of Ajrestan also provides militants with a launching pad for attacks into adjacent provinces in the east of the country. Ajrestan is a small town surrounded by about 100 villages in a predominantly rural area. Earlier this month militants killed 10 people when they attacked a government compound in Ghazni. The fall of the district comes days before Afghanistan's new president Ashraf Ghani is due to be inaugurated. He secured the position after striking a unity deal in which runner-up Abdullah Abdullah will nominate someone to a post similar to that of prime minister. The power-sharing deal was announced last week after months of tension following disputed presidential elections. Foreign combat forces are set to withdraw troops by the end of 2014 with control being transferred to Afghan national forces.

The battle between Ms Purcell and former chairman William Taylor left the institution without a vice-chancellor or chairman in 2014, leading to \"fractured\" relationships which put the governance of a university \"in peril\", according to a report published last year.

They had been married less than three years and his battlefield missives were his way of talking to her. Two days before the fateful morning when the Anzacs landed on the shores of Gallipoli, Benjamin, then a captain in the Australian army, wrote a letter to Phyllis that he feared would be his last. \"In case the worst happens and I am unable to make any more entries I will take this opportunity to bid you 'goodbye,' dear girl,\" he told Phyllis. \"Know that I died loving you with my whole heart and soul, dearest wife that a man ever had. Kiss little Gwen and our new baby, who perhaps I may never see, and never let them forget Daddy.\" He asked Phyllis to be patient with his mother, told his wife she must eventually consider remarrying, and said he was not afraid to die. But in his later diary entries the horrors of the war are clear. He records seeing men \"weeping like babies\" and \"cowering at every explosion\". One incident he recalls is particularly poignant. A young message runner returns from the fighting \"looking like a maniac,\" calling for Captain Leane but unable to recognise the officer.

The group began to shift its messaging in May 2016 amid losses in its Iraqi and Syrian heartland, saying that victory was not determined by territorial hold but persistence in faith. It emphasised its enduring ideological reach, insisting that the group was invincible even if it faced what it portrayed as temporary setbacks on the ground. IS cited a military official as saying the group had begun readying for its battle to defend Mosul from the first day it captured the city, suggesting the group knew its hold on the city could never last. Following the launch by Iraqi forces of the operation to recapture Mosul in October 2016, IS has played up the strength of its affiliates in other countries. It recently suggested that the capture of parts of the city of Marawi in the Philippines by pro-IS militants in May was reminiscent of its capture of Mosul, indicating that the symbolic centre of its so-called \"caliphate\" could be revised. The group noted that a precursor had lost control of areas of Iraq in 2007 but resurfaced much stronger. IS has demonstrated its ability to carry out attacks in various parts of Iraq outside Mosul, with a current offensive near Qayyara to the south of the city diverting attention from its crumbling \"caliphate\". It has issued multiple calls for attacks worldwide, and in June claimed a third attack in the UK and its first attacks in Iran and Israel. In the course of the battle for Mosul, IS has often said the city would prove to be a graveyard for its enemies. But on 7 July it described Mosul's Old City as a graveyard for thousands of civilians, blaming their suffering on US-led coalition bombardment. This served its narrative depicting an alleged global war against Sunni Islam. IS used the destruction in Mosul - including the landmark Great Mosque al-Nuri and Hadba minaret, reportedly orchestrated by the group itself - to serve its own ends. It boasted about the fierce resistance its members had put up in the city over almost nine months, against an array of powerful enemies. It also gloated about the material and human cost visited upon its foes.

{"id": 1904, "article": "Media playback is not supported on this device In Saturday's earlier game Ireland travel to Italy determined to bounce back after their opening defeat by Scotland, while on Sunday Vern Cotter's buoyant Scots travel to Paris, where they have not won since 1999. But the undoubted highlight of the weekend is the 130th edition of Wales and England, a fixture that was first played in 1881. \"You go to the hotel and unless you take steps, players get rung incessantly through the night. Those things happen,\" Jones said. \"You go to the ground and the traffic controller drives slower than the traffic's going to make sure you're late. \"You get to the ground and there's something wrong with your dressing room - there's lights off or the heater's switched off. \"You can't check because they traditionally tell you one thing and something else happens. It happens regularly in South Africa and it happens regularly in Wales.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Even before Jones aired his concerns the occasion was always likely to be a high-octane affair as, given their long-standing history and neighbourly rivalry, Wales playing England in Cardiff is among the most emotive occasions in world sport. Wales' assistant coach Robin McBryde believes that the fierce rivalry is an inevitable consequence of the shared history and proximity of the two nations. \"We are neighbours, aren't we? I have got two English brothers-in-law,\" he said \"It is that English-Welsh rivalry, and wanting to get the better of your neighbour. It's as simple as that.\" England have 60 victories to Wales' 57 in the teams' 129 matches with nine draws. However, Wales have a 60% winning record against England in Cardiff. Jones, whose side have won a national record 15 Tests in a row, has been merrily making mischief since the narrow opening win over France last weekend, suggesting earlier this week that the Welsh are \"a cunning lot\". Saturday's match is the sort of occasion which prompts week-long debates about whether the roof on the Principality Stadium will be open or closed. Wales wanted it closed, to ramp up the noise inside the 72,000-capacity stadium which is renowned for its vertiginous stands and electric atmosphere. Media playback is not supported on this device England, as the away side, had the final say under Six Nations rules and - having said he was not bothered one way or the other earlier in the week - Jones has opted for it to be left open. While the Australian has been stoking the flames, the hosts have been more circumspect - although Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards was moved to compare Jones to legendary former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough. Media playback is not supported on this device And despite his barbs the England head coach has not been short of compliments, praising the Principality stadium's \"amazing atmosphere\". He added: \"How could you not want to play rugby there? \"It is one of the greatest rugby countries in the world, so to play Wales in Cardiff with that sort of atmosphere is one of the great delights of rugby.\" Wales have injury worries about winger George North - who is chasing a new record of scoring a try in six championship games in a row - and fly-half Dan Biggar and both will have fitness tests on matchday. Media playback is not supported on this device But there is some good news for them, with world class number eight Taulupe Faletau back in action, although he only makes it as far as the bench after injury. England have made two changes from the team that edged past France, with winger Jack Nowell recalled and back rower Jack Clifford handed just his second England start as Jones searches for more ball carrying options. Scotland have lost nine successive games on French soil since they won 36-22 at the Stade de France in 1999 on the final weekend of their triumph in the last Five Nations championship. How their forwards match up against a formidably physical French pack could be key to halting that losing run. Scotland flanker Hamish Watson, who weighs in at a relatively lightweight 15st 12lb, says he is confident that he and his team-mates can meet the challenge. Media playback is not supported on this device \"They are a big pack and will pose us a different threat to Ireland, We know they are going to scrum well and have been concentrating on that,\" he said. \"But it's nothing we can't deal with, so I think it will go well.\" France coach Guy Noves believes that counterpart Vern Cotter's work is bearing fruit as he approaches the end of his stint with Scotland. Gregor Townsend will take over in June. \"We will mainly adapt to the Scottish rugby that you have seen evolve for four years - a game based on commitment, speed, aggression, with players who have gained confidence in a highly organised collective,\" he said. Scotland have made one change with the starting line-up that beat Ireland with John Barclay coming in at blind-side flanker to replace Ryan Wilson, who is out with an elbow infection. Ireland coach Joe Schmidt will make sure his side are at Rome's Stadio Olimpico in plenty of time for the weekend's opening fixture as he feels that their late arrival at Murrayfield last week contributed to their lacklustre start to the match. Ireland, whose team bus turned up about 15 minutes late after its police escort reportedly guided it away from an agreed route, conceded three tries in the first half hour to trail by 16 points. \"I don't think it was apathy, there was a bit of anxiety at not having had the full period to warm-up,\" said Schmidt. \"Players get anxious, they get very routine-based and I do think it's a challenge for a professional player that they can be adaptable in different circumstances, so they can still start well and cope.\" Schmidt has kept faith with fly-half Paddy Jackson at 10 with Johnny Sexton still returning to fitness after a calf injury picked up playing for Leinster in January.

{"id": 1914, "article": "The disparity between forecasts and the eventual Conservative majority has been blamed on \"shy Tory\" voters or a late swing to David Cameron's party. But polling expert John Curtice highlighted sampling \"deficiencies\". His report said \"more time and effort\" was needed to find Conservative voters. Pre-election polls had suggested the result was too close to call, but the Conservatives went on to win an absolute majority, with 331 seats. Prof Curtice, who wrote the report for research agency NatCen, suggested polling difficulties arose \"primarily because [pollsters] interviewed too many Labour supporters and not enough Conservatives\". NatCen interviewed 4,238 people between July and November last year for its British Social Attitudes Survey. It said it had made \"repeated efforts\" over the four months to make contact with the people it had selected to interview - and among those it was able to contact most easily, Labour had a six-point lead. However, among the harder-to-contact group, who took between three and six calls to track down, the Conservatives were 11 points ahead. \"Polls are conducted over just two or three days, which means they are more likely to interview those who are contacted most easily, either over the internet or via their phone,\" the report said. The report rejected the \"shy Tories\" argument, which suggests Conservatives are less willing to declare their voting intentions when asked. It said even when polling companies returned to respondents and asked how they had voted, they still put Labour and the Tories neck and neck. But the British Social Attitudes survey put the Conservatives 6.1 points ahead of Labour, close to the actual election margin of 6.6 points. Polling companies use a complex method to attempt to make their surveys representative, including weighting the responses to match the UK's demographic profile. The report said its random sampling method was more representative. Prof Curtice added: \"A key lesson of the difficulties faced by the polls in the 2015 general election is that surveys not only need to ask the right questions but also the right people.\" An investigation by the British Polling Council into the polling failures ahead of May's general election is due to be published later this month.", "question": "The failure of @placeholder pollsters to predict the outcome of May 's general election may have been because Conservative voters are harder to track down , a report suggests .", "option_0": "extreme", "option_1": "opinion", "option_2": "personal", "option_3": "professional", "option_4": "smart"}

The statue of the Queen was created by sculptor James Butler, and inspired by the 1954 and 1969 portraits by Pietro Annigoni. The artwork was unveiled by Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow. Magna Carta was granted by King John on 15 June 1215, establishing that the king was subject to the law rather than being above it. It paved the way towards modern rights and freedoms, and was sealed by the king at Runnymede.

It revealed bats carry more potential threats than other mammals. The researchers hope the knowledge could be used to prevent the next HIV, Ebola or flu. Some of the most worrying infections have made the jump from animals to people - the world's largest Ebola outbreak seemed to start in bats, while HIV came from chimpanzees. The researchers' challenge - and it was far from easy - was to predict from where the next could emerge. They looked at all 586 viruses known to infect 754 species of mammal. This included 188 zoonotic infections - those that have infected both humans and other mammals. But they also knew some species had been studied in incredible detail while others had been practically ignored. So the researchers used the information they did know to fill the gaps in their knowledge and estimate which species were harbouring viruses with the potential to infect people. The study, published in the journal Nature, predicts 17 zoonotic infections in every species of bat and 10 in every species of primate and rodent. The team then mapped the ranges of species and the infections they carry to work out where the world's danger zones are. The threat from rodents was again global, but with a concentration in South America. Dr Kevin Olival, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: \"The missing hotspots are different for different groups of mammals in different parts of the world, but the bat signal overwhelms some of the others. \"But I'm not scared of bats, it's not the bat's fault.\" The researchers hope their maps will help the world prepare for the next infection that makes the jump.

{"id": 1921, "article": "The controversial drug room was opened by Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo and Health Minister Marisol Touraine on Tuesday. It is near the Gare du Nord, a busy station where drug crime is common. The users will exchange hard drugs like heroin and crack for substitutes, along with sterile injection kits. Critics fear it could fuel drug abuse. Ms Touraine said France had become the tenth country to set up drug rooms, which Switzerland pioneered in 1986. There are plans to open two more - in Strasbourg, eastern France, and Bordeaux in the south-west. \"This is a very important moment in the battle against the blight of addiction,\" Ms Touraine said. One of the chief arguments for such places is that they put addicts - often poor, marginalised and sick - in touch with medics and social workers, who can help them. Consuming substitute drugs in a clean environment also reduces the risk that addicts face from contaminated hard drugs bought from criminal dealers. The Paris facility is in the Lariboisiere Hospital, and has a separate entrance. It will formally open its doors to addicts on Friday, and about 200 are expected there daily. The addicts will have to register, but are not obliged to give their real name, and will not be pursued by police for going there. The facility has a dozen cubicles affording some privacy to addicts when they inject. It is run by Gaia, an association that helps to treat addicts, and the annual running cost is put at €1.2m (¡ê1.1m; $1.3m). A leading Paris politician in the centre-right Republicans party, Philippe Goujon, is among the opponents who fear the initiative will undermine efforts to stop the hard drugs trade. \"We're moving from a policy of risk reduction to a policy of making drugs an everyday, legitimate thing. The state is saying 'you can't take drugs, but we'll help you to do so anyway,\" he told the daily Le Figaro (in French).

In that survey just 55% of patients said the food they had been served was \"good\". Alex Jackson, co-ordinator of the Campaign for Better Hospital Food, said existing policies that regulate food served in prisons and schools should be extended to hospitals. \"It is time for the government to come clean about the sorry state of hospital food in England and set mandatory standards for patient meals. \"This would only involve extending an existing policy which has seen it set mandatory standards for prison food and food served in government departments, to go alongside those that already exist for school food. \"Surely patients recovering in hospital have the same right to good food as government ministers, school kids and prisoners?\" Campaigners point to hospitals such as Darlington Memorial, where the award-winning food is locally sourced and cooked on site. Through buying in bulk and cutting down on waste, the hospital manages to stick to a very tight budget of around ?¡ê2.60 per patient per day. Patient Concern called the findings \"shocking\".

The Scottish government has asked for views on whether that period should be extended and, if so, by how much. Ministers argue that short jail terms are ineffective and lead to high rates of reoffending. Figures have suggested 60% of those sentenced to less than three months are reconvicted within a year. In 2010 the government introduced, for the first time in Scots law, a presumption against short prison sentences of three months or less except where no other punishment would be appropriate. The SNP minority government at the time dropped a plan to impose a six-month limit because of fears it would be voted down by the opposition. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has now revived the proposal and called for \"bold action\" to stop offenders \"going in and out of prison time and time again and reoffending upon release\". Under the proposals, he has said offenders would serve their sentences in the community instead of being jailed and receive help for the causes of their offending behaviour, including drug or alcohol addictions or mental-health issues. Some have argued there should be a presumption against sentences of less than 12-months.

HRG said that it began discussions with Wesfarmers in September, with a firm offer resulting in November. Wesfarmers owns Australia's biggest home improvement retailer, Bunnings, as well as the Coles supermarket chain. In its own stock market announcement on Thursday Wesfarmers said that, if its bid is successful, the Homebase brand would be replaced. It described the planned deal as: \"The first step in a programme which would invest in the Homebase team and reinvigorate core Homebase assets to build an exciting new Bunnings branded business over three to five years.\" Like-for-like sales at Homebase rose 5.0% in the 18 weeks to 2 January, HRG said, although that was still slightly lower than analysts' forecasts. Shares in Home Retail Group added 2.2% to 152.7p. Last week, Sainsbury's said HRG had rejected a takeover approach in November. On Wednesday, Sainsbury's said it could shut up to 200 Argos stores and relocate them within its supermarkets if it bought HRG. The supermarket group said it was considering its options after its initial bid approach was turned down. Home Retail Group chief executive John Walden, said he believed the sale of Homebase to Wesfarmers would \"provide good value to shareholders\" and allow HRG to focus on its efforts to improve Argos' balance sheet and overall financial position. HRG said Argos had made meaningful progress towards its reinvention as a \"digital retail leader\". Mr Walden added: \"I continue to believe that the capabilities being develop in the Argos transformation plan will position Argos as a retail leader in an increasingly digital future.\" The group added Argos had experienced its best ever sales day on Black Friday, with total sales up 41%. Online sales were up 45% in the week leading to Black Friday and accounted for 62% of total sales compared with 52% a year earlier.

The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) said it was part of its commitment to a shared future strategy. It is understood National Museums NI has not yet responded to the letter. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr McCausland said: \"There are a range of perspectives and I want simply to have in there consideration given to reflecting the diversity of views in Northern Ireland. \"It's also in fact a human rights issue and an equality issue because culture rights, the rights of people in Northern Ireland, should be implemented.\" In the letter, Mr McCausland said he believes his department and the trustees \"share a common desire to ensure that museums are reflective of the views, beliefs and cultural traditions that make up society in Northern Ireland.\" He says National Museums' contribution to the shared future agenda can best be achieved by \"practical measures\". Among these measures are consideration of how best to recognise the role of the Grand Lodge of Ireland and other fraternal organisations. He specifically mentions the \"Plantation to Power Sharing\" exhibition which is currently on at the Ulster Museum and suggests that the trustees should consider changes to the exhibition before the summer months. In terms of Ulster-Scots, Mr McCausland wrote that the local history exhibition should recognise the contribution of the Hamilton Montgomery Settlement, considered to be the most important event in Ulster-Scots history. The issue of the origin of the universe and the different theories explaining it was previously raised by Mr McCausland's DUP assembly colleague Mervyn Storey. He said that he wanted the views of creationists - the concept of God creating the universe in contrast to the scientific theory of evolution - to be represented in the exhibitions. Without specifically mentioning creationism, Mr McCausland's letter includes a request for the trustees to consider how alternative views of the origin of the universe can be recognised and accomodated. In a statement, DCAL said it welcomed the discussions on the NMNI's potential contribution to the shared future agenda and was awaiting a response. Meanwhile, SDLP culture spokesman Thomas Burns said it was \"a mark of a liberal society that its cultural institutions should be free of party-political interference\". \"Any attempt to politicise public spaces or dictate to cultural institutions is a serious threat to our hopes of a shared society and should be resolutely resisted,\" he said.

The government said it was delivering on its commitment to replace all properties sold on a one-for-one basis. But in a submission to the Treasury, the LGA said the scale of the housing crisis demanded that action to fix the lack of affordable housing was taken immediately. \"The government's recent announcement of an additional ?¡ê5bn investment in the form of loans to private sector organisations and for building homes on surplus public land is a welcome step,\" the LGA said. \"However, councils are also well placed to bridge the gap between housing need and future building levels and are keen to see - and support - delivery at speed.\" The LGA wants to hold talks with ministers over whether councils' housing revenue accounts  - the accounts covering rents and assets - could be removed from the public sector debt book so as to enable borrowing against these assets. \"This would allow local government to rapidly contribute new homes in the market, meet a wide range of local needs and generate significant medium and long term returns,\" it said. Councils also want powers to replace council homes that are sold off under Right to Buy arrangements. Currently, the government only allows local authorities to keep 30% of the cost for replacement council homes. This means councils cannot build replacements - especially as they are unable to borrow to fund the rest. The call comes as new figures were released on the sales of social housing. These revealed nearly 22,000 social housing dwellings were sold from 2015-16 - 12,557 by local authorities and a further 9,435 by housing associations. The sales amount to about 0.5% of the total stock of four million social houses in England. There was a particular spike in the percentage of housing association homes sold to private firms. This was up 46% and government statisticians said this was likely to be because of housing associations taking a more active approach to managing their assets.

Rosa & Associates is run by Italian Federico Rosa and Volare Sports is headed by Dutchman Gerard van de Veen. One of Mr Rosa's recent clients was the Boston marathon winner Rita Jeptoo, who was banned for two years from athletics after failing a doping test. His lawyers have written to AK demanding to know the exact allegations against his clients and what to do with the Kenyan athletes who are trained and ready for competitions in Spain, China, the Czech Republic and the UK. Mr Kipsang, who is represented by Volare Sports, is also the president of the Professional Athletes Association of Kenya. He told the BBC that AK did not have the knowledge or experience to represent athletes. \"We have confidential matters between an athlete and a manager which we can't discuss with Athletics Kenya,\" the former marathon world record holder said.

But while it remains a landmark in Johannesburg, several transitions have left it looking far from how it did 39 years ago, when it was first built. South African photographer Mikhael Subotzky and British artist Patrick Waterhouse have documented the apartment block's journey from luxury flats to a refuge for immigrants, from a potential prison site to a derelict half-demolished shell occupied by those who are either squatting or awaiting eviction. They first had the idea to tell the story of the building and its colourful past in 2007 and began documenting the life of the residents over the next five years, interviewing the remaining tenants and photographing daily life in the dilapidated building. They say they aimed to create a visual \"before and after\" of the building, from its original plans to its more recent incarnation: a place that has \"come to symbolise urban decay\", perceived as \"the epicentre of crime prostitution and drug dealing in Johannesburg\". The results will be on show from Saturday 6 December at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. The photographers came across this scene where three men were kneeling in prayer with Ponte City towering in the background. The hill site is used by many religious groups as a holy place. During their visits to the building, Subotzky and Waterhouse met many of the residents, some of whom invited the photographers to document their routines -some more intimate than others. This couple were getting ready to go out dancing for a night on the town. Subotzky and Waterhouse often photographed people in one of the many lifts that service the 54-storey Ponte City building; in this picture the young woman was on her way to a wedding.

{"id": 1953, "article": "So wrote HG Wells in a letter to the Times 80 years ago, in 1934. The author, famed for being an early pioneer of science-fiction writing, also had a strong interest in helping people with diabetes - because he was one of them. A year before, another letter from him had appeared in the newspaper appealing for funds to support the diabetes clinic at King's College Hospital in London. The letter to The Times Its success led the renowned thinker to believe people were willing to support a more adventurous enterprise. \"Something psychologically and socially valuable had been discovered: the latent solidarity of people subject to a distinctive disorder,\" he wrote in 1934. More prosperous people with diabetes were to be approached, to pay ?¡ê5 to become members of the Diabetes Association, which would then work for everyone with the condition. HG Wells wrote more than 100 books, including the science-fiction tales The Island of Dr Moreau, The Invisible Man and The Time Machine. But it was his doctor Robert Daniel (RD) Lawrence who persuaded him to lead the campaign to raise funds for diabetes. Dr Lawrence's clinic at King's College Hospital in London had become cramped and outdated, so in 1933 he asked some of his more affluent patients for contributions. Wells initially gave just 2s 6d to fund the association, pleading poverty. But when Lawrence complained, Wells wrote his first letter to the Times - appealing for others to contribute funds - and got the funding needed for new and improved facilities. Dr Lawrence had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1920, when there was no effective treatment and the condition was fatal. He moved to Italy, expecting to live out his last few years there. But in early 1923, he received a telegram from a colleague at King's Hospital London that said: \"Insulin, it works. Come quick.\" His biographer and daughter-in-law Jane Lawrence tells how, by that point, he was \"dwindling away\" but he made it back across Europe and received his first dose of insulin in May of that year.\" RD Lawrence went on to become a leading figure in forging understanding of diabetes as a condition and  fighting for those with it be able to live normal lives. His writings helped define how diabetes was viewed for decades. His book The Diabetic Life was first published in 1925, ran to 14 editions and was published in many languages. A practical guide to living with diabetes, The Diabetic ABC, was published in 1929. Forming the Diabetic Association was part of that. Dr Lawrence was elected chairman - a position he held until 1961 - while HG Wells became president. Jane Lawrence says: \"This was the first patient-centred association in the world. It was so unusual in those days where the doctor was 'god'.\" Not long before this, type 1 diabetes had been a death sentence. People with the condition needed insulin - and it was only used in humans in 1922. Diabetes UK Even in the 1930s, people would only have had access to insulin if they could afford it and life would not have been pleasant, even for them. They would have had to use large, thick needles to administer insulin, which was from animals and not fully purified and so there was a high risk of allergic reactions. Today, most insulin is made in laboratories. The needles they used would have needed to be washed and sterilised every day - as well as sharpened regularly. They were given a fixed amount of insulin - so would have to eat the right amount of food to counteract this, whether or not this left them feeling too full or still hungry. And their diet had to be around 70% fat. One of the association's first campaigns was for free access to insulin, well before the formation of the NHS. The organisation became the British Diabetic Association in 1954 and Diabetes UK in 2000. It is now a charity with an annual income of ?¡ê28m, with 300,000 supporters across the UK. There are 3.2m people diagnosed with the condition, and an estimated 630,000 who have diabetes, but don't know it. Around 90% have type 2, which usually develops over the age of 40 when people produce too little insulin - or the insulin produced fails to work properly. Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor. Barbara Young, Diabetes UK's current chief executive, said: \"All of us who work at Diabetes UK are immensely proud of our heritage, as it is hugely inspiring to follow in the footsteps of an author of the stature of HG Wells and an eminent physician like RD Lawrence. \"Diabetes UK's work during the 80 years since Wells wrote his letter to the Times is one of the reasons why life for people with diabetes today is much better  than it was in 1934.\" Wells was also prescient in seeing how the patient-group model might expand. In yet another prediction of the future, he envisaged the plethora of health groups we have now, writing: \"The experiment ... might not end with diabetics.\"", "question": "\" It is @placeholder to form a diabetic association open ultimately to all diabetics , rich or poor , for mutual aid or assistance , and to promote the study , the diffusion of knowledge , and the proper treatment of diabetes in this country . \"", "option_0": "resolved", "option_1": "managed", "option_2": "keen", "option_3": "needed", "option_4": "proposed"}

Around 2,000 names were sent by Toronto Police to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). The three forces referred themselves to the IPCC for investigation. The IPCC said it would now look at how that the intelligence - uncovered by officers from the international Operation Spade - was handled once it was received by the forces. Essex Police faces questions over how it dealt with information relating to Martin Goldberg, a teacher who took indecent photos of his pupils. Goldberg was found dead a day after being interviewed by the force. Police found hundreds of images of children getting changed on his computer. CEOP had been told about the deputy head in July 2012 but he was not interviewed by Essex Police until September this year. The IPCC wrote to all chief constables in England and Wales last month, asking them to review how they dealt with any information they had received relating to Operation Spade. North Yorkshire and North Wales Police subsequently referred themselves to the body. Cardiff paedophile Gareth Williams was among three names Canadian officers passed to North Wales Police in 2013. The force did not act on them for a year. Williams was jailed for five years in May. Deputy IPCC chairwoman Sarah Green said: \"There is rightly considerable public concern about how police forces deal with sexual offences involving children. \"The IPCC takes this issue seriously and proactively contacted all forces and asked them to review their handling of intelligence to determine the scale of any issues. \"Our investigations will examine carefully how intelligence from CEOP was dealt with by these three forces.\" The head of the National Crime Agency (NCA) - which now encompasses CEOP - last month apologised for delays in acting on the information passed to it in July 2012. How the agency handled that initial receipt of information is the subject of a separate IPCC probe.

{"id": 1971, "article": "The farmhouse has been  renovated - along with the Black Chair - awarded at the National Eisteddfod a few weeks after the bard's death in July 1917. He was killed on the first day of the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium. A new exhibition and visitors' centre has also been built, and marks the impact of the war on the community. \"We are using Hedd Wyn as a hook really, to be able to tell all those wider stories,\" explained Sian Griffiths, who is managing the project for the Snowdonia National Park Authority. \"The story of the war, the First World War and its effect; about the culture, the language, the community, and how people lived at that time. \"So when people come to Yr Ysgwrn, they really do get a feel of how people used to live. \"It's a very different world now to what it was 100 years ago - we are taking people back in time a little bit and helping them understand how that community lived at that time.\" Hedd Wyn was the bardic name of Ellis Humphrey Evans. He was 30-years-old when he died on the first day of the big push in what became the Third Battle of Ypres, as part of the 15th Battalion Royal Welsh Fusiliers tasked with capturing Pilckem Ridge. But he was injured half way across, and died at a first aid post on 31 July, 1917. However, his story lives on. In September 1917, the National Eisteddfod was being held at Birkenhead on Merseyside. As today, the greatest prize and honour is to win the eisteddfod chair for poetry. In 1917, it was for the poem 'Yr Arwr' - 'The Hero'. When the winner's named was called out in the pavilion, there was no answer. Instead, the chair was draped in a black cloth, witnessed from the stage by the then prime minister and war-time leader David Lloyd George. \"No words can adequately describe the wave of emotion that swept over the vast audience when the chair was draped with the symbols of mourning,\" the Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard newspaper reported at the time. The project to restore Yr Ysgwrn has seen the farmhouse itself completely gutted, with furniture removed, restored and replaced, to show just how it would have appeared during the time of Hedd Wyn. It even included taking samples of old wallpaper hidden under layer after layer of decorating, and having a new replica made to cover the kitchen walls. Upstairs, visitors can see the other bardic chairs won by the poet before his death, while in the parlour - pride of place - the Black Chair. After a decade in a dark and cold farmhouse, heated only by the kitchen fire, the chair had become fragile and damaged. It has taken more than a year to be restored by expert Hugh Haley in Carmarthen. \"Some bits of the chair had fallen off over the years and they needed to be restored and put back,\" said Ms Griffiths. \"It does look really, really nice.\" A former barn, the Beudy Llwyd, has been transformed into a visitors' centre, exhibition area and cafe funded by the park authority and Heritage Lottery Fund since it was acquired in 2012. Another farm building, the Beudy Ty, is home to a display that marks the memory of every single solider from the area killed in the Great War, and provides a place for quiet reflection. The farm itself remains home to the man responsible for keeping the memory of Hedd Wyn alive - his nephew Gerald Williams. He has kept the door open to the farmhouse and the Black Chair since 1954. Now 88-years-old, he is delighted to see both the house and the chair returned to their former glory. \"They've brought the furniture back now and it looks more like it used to be in the old days,\" he says. \"Before it was very bare and I didn't like it, because I'd seen it full of life. It looks a lot better. It will bring life back. \"Hedd Wyn was representing, not himself, but all the young men from the area and all the young men from Wales in a way. He was an icon. \"I am very happy to see it all coming back.\" Yr Ysgwrn will be reopening to the public on 6 June, though park officials said they had already had several large bookings, and urged visitors to check availability in advance.", "question": "The home of the World War One poet Hedd Wyn will be ready to @placeholder the public in the next two weeks , after a ¡ê 3 m restoration project .", "option_0": "prevent", "option_1": "serve", "option_2": "lose", "option_3": "welcome", "option_4": "stay"}

Talks between the Palestinians and the Vatican - which favours a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - have gone on for 20 years. President Abbas meets the Pope this weekend when two 19th Century Palestinian nuns will be canonised. The Vatican is eager that property and civil rights of the Catholic Church in the Palestinian state is protected, correspondents say. According to the New York Times, it has strong religious interests in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories that include Christian holy sites. The BBC's David Willey in Rome says that Pope Francis is making every effort to strengthen the Christian presence in the Middle East at a time when hundreds of thousands of Arab Christians are fleeing Islamist violence. The Vatican's announcement comes amid growing momentum to recognise Palestinian statehood. Over the last year the European Parliament as well as the UK, Republic of Ireland, Spain and France have all passed non-binding motions in favour. Sweden has gone further, officially recognising Palestine as a state. The moves have been criticised by Israel, which says recognition of statehood in this way discourages Palestinians from resuming talks on a final status agreement. The agreement on Wednesday will define Catholic Church activities in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, the Holy See said on Wednesday. A joint statement released by the Vatican said that the wording of the treaty had been finalised and would be officially signed by the respective authorities \"in the near future\".

The trade is legal in Japan for items imported before 1989 - but no new stock can be brought into the country. Many other countries have banned the trade outright over concerns that it contributes to elephant poaching. Rakuten also banned the sale of sea turtle products on its site, telling AFP news agency it was responding to \"growing international concern\". \"We expect it will take 1-2 months for all listings of these prohibited products to be removed,\" it said. On the day of the announcement, a large number of ivory items were still listed for sale, including many carved personal seals known as \"hanko\". Sellers of such items are expected to maintain careful records of their origin, and use only government-regulated ivory stockpiles. But activists believe the rules are often circumvented and the precious material is often smuggled across borders. Yahoo Japan, another site which allows the sale of ivory, has previously come under fire for the practice. However, a spokesman told Reuters it did not plan to halt the trade, saying: \"We don't think that the legal ivory trade in Japan has any impact on African elephant numbers.\" \"It is important to recognise there are cultural differences between different countries,\" he added. African elephant numbers have plummeted in the last century, and there are an estimated 500,000 remaining on the continent.

Mr Justice Wyn Williams refused to give Mr Pendragon permission to launch a judicial review action, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to show that the Ministry of Justice might have acted unreasonably. Former soldier Mr Pendragon, 57, who changed his name by deed poll, was dressed in white druid robes and represented himself at the hearing. The cremated remains of more than 40 bodies, thought to be at least 5,000 years old, were removed from a burial site at Stonehenge in 2008 and ministers gave permission to allow the bones to be examined at Sheffield University until 2015. Mr Pendragon told the judge that the bones were remains of members of the \"royal line\" or \"priest caste\" who could have been the \"founding fathers of this great nation\". He said he did not believe the bones would ever be returned to the site, and that his views were not being taken into account. His allegations were denied by the Ministry of Justice. Talking prior to the hearing, Mr Pendragon said: \"If we don't get them to, force them to, put them back, they're going to end up in Salisbury museum. \"I know that for a fact, and I'm not prepared to stand around and wait for them to come up with other excuses.\" After the hearing, Mr Pendragon, who signed himself as Arthur Rex on court papers, vowed to continue his fight to have the remains reburied.

In the poll, many respondents said they bought ready meals, even though they knew these may contain high levels of saturated fat and salt.

She said one couple, aged 75 and 80, were living 100 miles apart because one of the pair receives a widow's pension. Policing Minister Brandon Lewis said pensions must be fair and sustainable. Under the 1987 Police Pension Scheme, police widows and widowers who remarry, or move in with a partner, have their pensions revoked. In 2015, the UK government amended the rules to make an exception for spouses of officers killed in the line of duty, but only if they remarried or moved in with a partner after 1 April that year. Labour MP Ms Moon said ministers should not \"seek to profit\" by \"condemning 22,000 widows to a life of loneliness and isolation\" through the loss of police pensions. Referring to one couple affected by the ruling, she said: \"They want to spend their twilight years together without financial penalty - why are they being denied that right? \"We have to stop putting a price on love, and this government has to make sure that the widows and widowers, and their children, have access to the pension rights that were put there to protect them for the future.\" Responding for the government, Mr Lewis said it recognised the risks faced by police officers as part of their job, pointing to the changes to the pension rules in 2015. But he said there was a difference with the armed forces, where the \"mobile nature\" of life made it difficult for the partners of service personnel to provide for their own financial future. \"The same combination of risk to life of the member and disruption to family life can not be said to apply to other public service workforces,\" Mr Lewis said. \"In the case of police officers, we do not believe it would be justified to make the same changes for all survivors of police officers.\" He added: \"We have made clear our commitment to ensuring that public service pensions are affordable, sustainable and fair,\" saying this applied to taxpayers as well as scheme members.", "question": "An elderly couple are spending their \" twilight years \" apart because of a \" petty @placeholder \" on police pensions , a Welsh MP has told the Commons .", "option_0": "failures", "option_1": "crime", "option_2": "injustice", "option_3": "raid", "option_4": "error"}

The remains, dating between the 2nd and 4th Century, were discovered during a series of excavations between 2010 and 2015 at a former factory site in Western Road. However, the university said some bodies were buried with grave goods or exhibit burial customs not previously seen in the city. Mr Morris said six had African cranial features but \"excitingly\" two of them, one a child, appear to have been born in England. He said by studying their teeth the team was able to tell what type of water they drank and where in the country it originated. Through this process, known as isotope analysis, they can chart migration. The archaeologist said one of the people was probably born in the Pennines area and the other in Leicester itself. He said there are a number of theories why they were in Leicester including for trade or military reasons. Skeletons of African origin, dating from the same period, have been found in York and at Hadrian's Wall, but this is the first evidence in Leicester.

The US has been urging Beijing to put pressure on Pyongyang as tensions mount over Kim Jong-un's nuclear ambitions. China is North Korea's only major ally, trading partner and aid donor. Figures from China's Ministry of Commerce show that bilateral trade with North Korea was up 37.4% in the first three months of 2017, compared with the same period a year earlier. That is roughly the figure President Trump quoted.  But the ministry said that when the first five months of the year were taken into account, trade grew by only 13.7%. And over the same period, imports of North Korean goods into China fell 9.3% to $720m the ministry said. A report in the state-controlled Global Times suggested the first three months of 2017 were an exception, and came after three consecutive years of declining trade between the two countries. Responding to Mr Trump's tweet, the paper's editorial said: \"First quarter data cannot speak for the whole year\". It added China's trade with North Korea was now roughly equal to its trade with Mongolia, which has an eighth of the population. China has banned the import of coal, iron ore, gold and rare earth minerals, and several other raw minerals from North Korea. It has also banned sales of jet fuel to North Korea. The fresh trade data was released as tensions rose following North Korea's latest test of a long-range missile, which it is believed was capable of reaching Alaska. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are preparing for meetings at the G20 summit in Hamburg, where North Korea's nuclear aspirations are expected to be high on the agenda.

Correspondents say Israel is likely to continue to push for Gaza to be demilitarised, and Hamas will continue to demand the blockade of Gaza to be lifted. The issues have scuppered previous talks, conducted through intermediaries. However, an unidentified Hamas negotiator said their demands were likely to be \"more modest\" this time.
