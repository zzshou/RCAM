{"article": "The 34-year-old carded a final round of 72 to finish as the top Scot on level par for the tournament. But he says the mental side of his game is letting him down on the big stage. \"If you don't have a sharp short game and if you are not strong mentally, that is the difference,\" Ramsay told BBC Scotland. \"I just play a little bit too conservative at times. The difference is you have to walk with a little bit more of a strut. Media playback is not supported on this device \"I have got to surround myself with as many positive people as possible.

He finished in a tie for 22nd place, with USA player Jordan Spieth winning the event on 12 under. \"I just played poorly today,\" Ramsay added. \"I didn't execute any of my shots. The week was summed up by the last hole. It was a very tough pin to get to and I decided to go for the middle of the green and it just run off the back edge. \"I rolled it up to six feet and didn't hit the hole with the putt.

The 42-year-old, however, later revealed he had been close to pulling out before his round got started. \"I did something to my neck on the range this morning after hitting a couple of three woods,\" he said. \"I actually thought for a couple of minutes I wouldn't be going out. I couldn't really turn through the ball but I hobbled round. I had a little bit of physio on the putting green before I teed off.\" Drysdale, who finished in a tie for 60th in his only other Open appearance to date, at Turnberry in 2009, is now hoping to make himself a regular at the majors. \"It was a good experience overall,\" he said. \"Finish top 30 or somewhere like that, I'm delighted.

{"article": "The court ruled in favour of researchers who say human embryonic stem cell research involved the destruction of human embryos. Judge Royce Lamberth said lawsuits brought against the new guidelines could now go ahead. President Obama lifted a ban on funding for stem cell research in March. Critics say the ban, which was kept in place by Mr Obama's predecessor, George W Bush, impeded the fight to find treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes. The suit, which was also backed by some Christian groups, is against the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Those against the new plan to increase funding argued the NIH policy violated US law and also took funds from researchers seeking to work with adult stem cells. \"ESC (embryonic stem cell) research is clearly research in which an embryo is destroyed,\" Judge Lamberth said. He added: \"To conduct ESC research, ESCs must be derived from an embryo. The process of deriving ESCs from an embryo results in the destruction of the embryo. Thus ESC research necessarily depends upon the destruction of a human embryo.\" But Judge Lamberth said an injunction would not \"seriously harm\" the embryonic studies because it did \"not interfere with their [researchers'] ability to obtain private funding for their research\". The Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which Congress adds to budget legislation each year, played an important role in the case. The amendment bans the use of federal funds to destroy human embryos. With the injunction in place, Judge Royce Lamberth is now likely to hear groups on both sides of the case argue whether the new guidelines should be permanently blocked or allowed to continue.", "question": "A US @placeholder court has issued a temporary injunction blocking plans by the Obama administration to increase funding for stem cell research .", "option_0": "processing", "option_1": "district", "option_2": "state", "option_3": "group", "option_4": "equalities", "label": 1}

{"article": "It was second versus third at Cappielow, and there was very little between the two teams. Morton threatened through Jamie Lindsay and Mark Russell, but neither could beat United goalkeeper Cammy Bell. Tony Andreu and Jamie Robson came closest for the visitors, but the breakthrough remained elusive. Both sides would have been expecting an exacting test, since Morton were on a run of six consecutive league wins while United had won their last seven games. The players might have been brimming with confidence, but the upshot was an encounter that quickly fell into a stalemate. United were the more assertive at the outset, and midfielder Charlie Telford rifled an early shot just over. Morton are capable of being dogged, though, and their defence was built on the solid foundations of Thomas O'Ware and former United centre-back Gavin Gunning. The home side's resurgence was also reliant on the clever movement and direct running of their front men, Gary Oliver and Jai Quitongo. Both were capable of alarming the United defence, and the latter would have been the reason why a number of scouts were due at the game. As well as his strength and purpose, the first-half also saw evidence of his temper, as he threw the ball at United defender Mark Durning after a heavy challenge, prompting a yellow card from referee Crawford Allan. United were marginally more incisive, with Blair Spittal - from a header - and Simon Murray, who finished tamely, both registering attempts on goal before the break. As a cold rain fell ever more heavily, the game seemed stuck in its ways. The two sides even traded similar chances, with Morton midfielder Jamie Lindsay breaking through the United defence but shooting straight at goalkeeper Cammy Bell. Then Scott Fraser found himself in a near-identical situation at the other end, and his effort was saved by Morton goalkeeper Derek Gaston. He had to look lively again moments later, when Charlie Telfer slipped through Andreu and the United midfielder swept a shot on target that the goalkeeper saved. Both sides pushed hard for a breakthrough, and United almost secured all three points in the closing stages, but Gaston was alert enough to block Robson's shot from the back post with his legs. Morton's Jim Duffy: \"For the first hour we played well. In the last half-hour, Dundee United got a grip of the game and started causing us problems. Derek Gaston had two or three fantastic saves, but in the first hour we probably just edged it. \"Dundee United might think they had clearer chances, and they probably did, but in the first half I thought we were slightly better. In the second half, they were better, so a decent point for us. \"Dundee United will be expected to challenge for the title. We're not at that level but in any given game we're tough opponents. Without being brilliant, we still made it tough for Dundee United and gave them a real competitive match. \"We needed a bit more composure in the first half when we had chances, and at set pieces we normally attack the ball better and we didn't capitalise on one or two opportunities. But in the last 20 minutes in particular, Dundee United had two or three great chances and one goal would probably have won it. \"It's November, it's far too early [to talk about making the play-offs] and far too many things can happen. Teams can start well and fall away and it can happen the other way around. At this moment in time, get as many points on the board, see where you are at the turn of the year and then we'll take it from there.\" Dundee United's Ray McKinnon: \"It was [frustrating], it's a tough place to come, Morton are on a good run and you can see why. They work extremely hard, but overall on chances we're disappointed not to take the three points. \"As the game goes on, it opens up and we played some nice football until that final third, when we just couldn't get it in the goal. On another day we probably would have won the game, but it's a difficult place to come, they're a good side, well organised with some dangerous players. \"Over the 90 minutes, we probably deserved to win the game [but] football's not like that, you don't always get what you deserve. \"In the last 30 minutes especially, [the players] really wanted to win that game and they gave everything. I'm pleased with that, I can't always get the result that I want, but I can get the attitude and the desire. We definitely had that today.\" Match ends, Morton 0, Dundee United 0.

{"article": "As Africa's most-populous country turns 56, many Nigerians may not be in the mood for celebration - preoccupied as they are with the ongoing recession. For Nigerian businesses, 2016 has indeed been a challenging year. The oil-dependent nation is presently in an economic downturn, largely because of the drop in oil prices. As a consequence, the prices of goods and services have gone up and for many businesses profits are thin. But some fresh, young entrepreneurs are bucking the trend. \"Whatever direction the economy goes, there are always opportunities,\" says Obinna Onunkwo, one of the Nigerians who is changing the face of the property scene. He and his business partner Laide Agboola - who are both under 40 - have just completed the development of a $25m (Â£19.2m), 7,700-sq-metre retail centre in Lagos. Nigeria's retail sector has seen significant growth over the past five years and savvy investors like Mr Onunkwo tapped in early. They managed to convince investors that the Maryland Mall in Ikeja was a bankable project. After five months of pitching to investors last year, they were able to raise funds. Mr Onunkwo believes the key to their success was that they ensured any loans they took were in the local currency, the naira, and not dollar loans. A good decision as the naira has weakened significantly over the past year. Sulaiman Balogun, co-founder of ToLet.com.ng - a Nigerian online property search portal, will remember 2016 as the year the cash came in. He and his business partners - Fikayo Ogundipe, Dapo Eludire and Seyi Ayeni - have succeeded in raising $1.2m. This is quite a feat as banks and financial institutions in Nigeria are not keen to lend to new businesses because of a lack of credit records and insufficient collateral. Enterprising technology-driven businesses like ToLet have to prove themselves, sometimes with very little capital, in the hope that big time venture capital firms take notice. After meeting at university, Mr Balogun and his partners started their business in June 2012, when they were in their twenties and at a time when online property search websites were not popular in Nigeria. The partners raised $400 from their personal savings and with family support embarked on their business journey. A year after launching their property platform they managed to raise $230,000 in seed capital from online business builder, Spark.ng, and this made a significant contribution to the growth of their business. Didi Akinyelure: \"They prove that it is possible to diversify away from oil - and show the enterprising spirit of the country as it celebrates its 56th year\" However, their big break came last month, when they caught the eye of Frontier Digital Ventures, a company passionate about online classifieds businesses, and they successfully secured additional funds. Two key things have been the secret to their success. \"We anticipated the recession and kept costs low,\" says Mr Balogun. \"And people still need to look for homes to rent in a recession.\" For Papa Omotayo, a 40-year-old Lagos-based architect, looking to markets outside Nigeria can help entrepreneurs weather an economic slump. \"Make sure your reach goes beyond Africa,\" says Mr Omotayo, the founder of AWCA, a multi-award winning ideas development agency. He has been driven to change the way the African continent is portrayed globally, through art and creativity. Teaming up with  29-year-old Maki Osakwe, creative director of Maki Oh, a fashion brand worn by the likes of Michelle Obama, Lupita Nyong'o and Solange Knowles, the two produced a short fashion film entitled Omi. It just bagged the Best New Director award this week at Milan's fashion film festival. Mr Omotayo says diversity is the secret to his success - ensuring that Nigeria's arts and culture scene reaches beyond Africa. And although he has seen a shift in the spending power of Nigerians this year, his creative business has not slowed down as much as expected, and he is confident that more opportunities will open up for him.

{"article": "Peter Kyle, Labour MP for Hove, has written to the transport secretary to tackle the issue. Govia Thameslink (GTR), Southern's owner, has unveiled a temporary, reduced timetable to ease the problem, with 341 fewer daily services. GTR said the revised timetable would improve passengers' journeys. The government said it was keeping Southern's performance \"under constant review\" but removing GTR's franchise could \"risk the progress being made\" and \"create uncertainty\" for passengers. Rail minister Claire Perry MP is due to give evidence next Monday, as the new timetable comes into force. But Mr Kyle said: \"What I really want is to know we have now hit rock bottom. \"We're always offered a guarantee that they are turning things around, but things then get worse. \"Now we have a revised timetable and I want to make sure that we are now at the point where we are pressing the reset button and we are able to move forward.\" He said the Govia Thameslink franchise was complicated because all revenue went through the government, which also set the timetables and fares. He said: \"I want to know at what point government will accept its responsibility for what is happening and step in to protect the interests of passengers.\" Kent County Council has written to Southern to ask for the revised timetable to be reconsidered because of the impact on essential train journeys. Two Southern routes serve Kent - Tonbridge to London via Redhill in Surrey, and Ashford to Brighton via Hastings. Both routes will see a reduced service. Southern's revised timetable is due to start on Monday, with 341 of its 2,242 daily services axed. The firm has previously blamed issues with crew availability for delays and cancellations of services. The RMT denied claims staff sickness had amounted to unofficial industrial action. The RMT and GTR have been in dispute over the introduction of more driver-only operated (DOO) services, which includes a change in conductors' roles. GTR have said the reduced timetable will provide \"a better, more consistent service\", but the RMT accused the operator of \"crisis management\". A GTR spokesman said: \"The amended timetable is temporary and aims to reduce the impact on passengers of unpredictable and late notice cancellations caused daily by unprecedented levels of train crew sickness and unwillingness among others to work overtime.\" He said the changes would  reduce service gaps and help manage crowding issues, and onboard staff would be able to use their discretion to declassify first class when necessary.

{"article": "Riding winds as fast as 230km/h (143mph), Kyra flips and whirls around the arena, a small blur of white spandex in a giant vertical wind tunnel. In the air the Singaporean teenager makes it all look effortless - a combination of dancing and floating - but in reality it is hard work. \"You use all your muscles for this sport. Even those muscles you never knew existed, they will start to ache. Even your wrists will hurt,\" she tells the BBC from Spain. About 200 indoor skydivers competed at the Wind Games held in Catalonia in Spain at the weekend- Kyra was not only among the few females who took part, but also one of the youngest. It was her first time competing against adults in a large-scale competition. But she easily beat them to win gold medals in the solo speed category, where a routine must be completed in the fastest time possible, and the freestyle category, where competitors are graded on their choreography and the difficulty of their moves. She says being smaller and lighter than her competitors did not give her an advantage. In fact, she thinks it made things more difficult. \"A lot of people think that if you're lighter, you're faster. I don't think so. Because when you're small, you have less body surface area, so you can push off less wind. If you're taller, you can push off more and have more force,\" she says. Kyra won the gold medal in the junior freestyle category at the FAI World Cup of Indoor Skydiving, held in October last year in Poland. Kyra fell into the sport accidentally. When she was nine her mother, an advertising executive, was hired to create commercials for indoor skydiving facility iFly in Singapore, and they needed a child to appear in their adverts. \"My mum asked me to try it out. I said yes. I really wanted to fly... and it was really exciting. \"When I first jumped in, I was nervous. But now these days when I go in, sometimes I forget I'm flying. The wind is so fast, sometimes when I fly, it feels like something is holding me up instead of me floating,\" she says. Kyra practices three times a week after school, and more frequently during competition season. Each session takes hours - flying repeatedly can be gruelling, and she can only fly in short spurts of three minutes before taking a break. She also regularly does long stretching sessions to improve her flexibility. Unlike most female indoor skydivers, Kyra does not have a gymnastics or dance background. But she tries to make up for that in other ways. \"Female competitors tend to have a very graceful style and are very flexible. So I try to incorporate that in my routine with powerful, aggressive moves which men use, that are very technical and fast,\" she says. Indoor skydiving is a very new sport, but Kyra sees it as her lifelong passion and hopes to be a professional athlete. \"When I was smaller I used to draw pictures of myself flying over Singapore. I even wanted to be an astronaut, to float in zero gravity. \"Humans are not meant to fly, but that has always been my dream. Now I can fly in a tunnel, so I'm glad to find this sport.\"", "question": "Fourteen - year - old indoor skydiver Kyra Poh was crowned the \" world 's fastest flyer \" in one of the sport 's biggest competitions , the Wind Games .

{"article": "The building society said the increase was due to \"growing demand\", and the limit would be in force from July. It means a 60-year-old could take out a 25-year mortgage as long as they prove they can afford the repayments. The move comes as Halifax increases its age limit for mortgages from 75 to 80 from Monday. There have been calls for the industry to do more to help older buyers after tougher mortgage checks, introduced in the wake of the financial crisis, have made it harder for middle-aged people to get a home loan. Rising house prices have exacerbated the issue, with many people not able to afford to buy their first home until they are in their thirties or forties. Nationwide said the new age limit would apply to existing customers for all its standard mortgages, but the maximum loan size would be Â£150,000, and could be no greater than 60% of the property value. \"Access to the mainstream market has been a challenge for older customers, resulting in their needs going unfulfilled. This measure helps to address these needs in a prudent, controlled manner,\" said Nationwide head of mortgages Henry Jordan. Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC the change could shake up the mortgage market. \"Why pay off the mortgage at at all?\" he said on Radio 5 Live. \"As long as the value of the property is there to meet the liability in the future, why worry about paying it off when you are alive?\" he added. House prices grew 7.6% in the year to February, official statistics suggest. And a recent survey by Halifax suggested that one in three 20- to 45-year-olds expected to be working beyond their retirement age to pay off their mortgage. Halifax said its decision was a response to changing demographics, with people living and working for longer. The policies of rival mortgage lenders for older borrowers varies. Santander, for example, says 75 is its cut-off while RBS' upper age limit is 70. HSBC says it does not turn down mortgages on the basis of age, but reviews applications of those over 75 on \"a case by case basis\".

Five men jailed for murder had their convictions overturned due to concerns over evidence available to the defence. Fourteen officers in total have now been told by the CPS they will not face charges over the handling of the case. Among the officers investigated were: Police believe Mr Nunes, from Wolverhampton, was a drug dealer who was shot after straying into another gang's territory. Announcing its decision, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had investigated a decision to delay a complaint inquiry until after the trial. It also looked into the failure to disclose a report into the management of a unit that handled sensitive witnesses, including the main trial witness. The nine officers, four of whom are still in service and five now retired, were investigated either on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice or criminal misconduct in a public office. The CPS said that when the Court of Appeal overturned the five men's convictions in 2012 it had been concerned about the decision not to investigate the complaint until after the trial, something it said \"was wrong\". \"We agreed with the Court of Appeal at the hearing and for the avoidance of doubt we still agree,\" the CPS said, although it added there was not enough evidence to show the decision was a deliberate attempt to pervert the course of justice. Regarding the second matter, the Court of Appeal called the decision not to disclose the report into the management of the unit \"a very bad case of non-disclosure\" and the CPS said it agreed.

{"article": "The handover took place outside the north-eastern border town of Arsal, where the men had been seized. Earlier, al-Nusra Front handed over to officials the body of one of four security personnel killed in captivity. The release is part of a deal brokered by Qatar that saw the Lebanese authorities free 13 Islamist prisoners. One of them was Saja al-Dulaimi, an ex-wife of so-called Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and daughter of an al-Nusra Front member. Jihadist militants from al-Nusra and IS, which are violently opposed to each other, seized more than two dozen soldiers and policemen during a major attack on Arsal in August 2014. Al-Nusra demanded that the Lebanese government free radical Sunni Islamist prisoners in exchange for the captives, and killed four of them in an attempt to force Beirut to act. Relatives of the security personnel also set up protest camps outside the government's headquarters in Beirut and organised regular demonstrations to press officials to negotiate their release. On Tuesday, the Lebanese General Security Directorate (GSD) confirmed that 16 soldiers and police held by al-Nusra had been handed to the Red Cross in wintry conditions in Wadi Hamid, in the hills near the Syrian border. In a deeply-divided country which has not been able to elect a president for 18 months, the release of the Lebanese army and police prisoners in a deal with al-Nusra Front provided a rare moment of national joy and unity. The army and police personnel seized by Nusra and Islamic State in August last year came from across the sectarian spectrum, so the affair transcended the sectarian rifts that bedevil Lebanese politics. They included Christians as well as Muslims of different denominations. The Druze chief, Walid Jumblatt, played a key role in discreet mediation led by Qatar, which has channels to the Syrian militants. The tortuous complexity of the negotiations, which broke down several times, led to some optimism that other intractable problems might also be solvable, not least the thorny issue of the vacant presidency Suleiman Franjieh, a Syria-leaning northern leader whose late grandfather of the same name was president in the 1970s, is currently in the spotlight as a figure who might win broad support. Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV interviewed one of the captives as they were being driven to the exchange point, accompanied by masked men armed with rifles. \"We would like to thank al-Nusra Front for releasing us. We would like to thank everyone who took part in the negotiations that led to our release,\" the captive said. Three women, one of them wearing a full-face veil and carrying a baby, were also shown getting out of a separate convoy of vehicles that included Red Cross cars. The woman wearing the veil confirmed in an interview with Al Jazeera that she was Saja al-Dulaimi. She said that she had been divorced by Baghdadi \"six or seven years ago\", adding that she would probably head to Turkey following her release. Lebanese officials said Ms Dulaimi, who is now married to a Palestinian, was pregnant when she was detained along with her two sons and a daughter - believed to be Baghdadi's - at a border crossing with Syria last November. She was reported to have given birth to a son in prison. Earlier, the body of a soldier killed in captivity in September 2014 by al-Nusra, Mohammed Hamiya, was handed over to the Red Cross and GSD agents. Another nine Lebanese security personnel are still being held by IS. Their fate is unknown, and there are no known channels for negotiation. The GSD said on Tuesday it would exert all possible efforts to secure their release.

{"article": "But the fact it was Facebook doing the buying came almost out of nowhere. News of the $2bn acquisition immediately trended on Twitter - provoking a mixture of surprise and, in a lot of cases, anger. Here's a round-up of reaction from around the web. Gaming news website Kotaku began by reflecting the tone of discussion with this opening line: \"Facebook has just announced that it's buying Oculus Rift for $2 billion. Seriously.\" It goes on to point out a posting on social news site Reddit one month ago in which an anonymous user wrote: \"No way to confirm this, but my friend works in the same building as Oculus, and he ran into Mark Zuckerberg taking the elevator to Oculus' floor.\" Following the news, a user returned to the prophetic post to write simply: \"I laughed at this, now I'm crying.\" On The Verge, Joshua Topolsky speculated on the bigger picture. \"As a service, Facebook is inspiring, as a platform, Facebook is scary,\" he wrote. \"That company now controls one of the most exciting technologies of the past fifty years. \"A truly revolutionary product that has reignited a dream many felt was all but dead and gone. What it will do with that technology is the only question that remains.\" While Oculus Rift can be used for many purposes, it is, at its heart, a device with which to play video games. For the past couple of years, a raft of games developers has been experimenting with the kit, adapting their games to work well with the hardware. But Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of the wildly popular online game Minecraft, did not hide his views. \"We were in talks about maybe bringing a version of Minecraft to Oculus,\" he tweeted. \"I just cancelled that deal. Facebook creeps me out.\" But another high-profile developer, Doom-co-creator John Carmack, dismissed any suggestion it was bad news. \"For the record, I am coding right now, just like I was last week. \"I expect the FB deal will avoid several embarrassing scaling crisis for VR.\" Then again, Mr Carmack's views are to be expected - he was hired by Oculus VR last year to be its chief technology officer, and stands to make some serious money from the deal. A perhaps more independent view comes from Dutch gaming company Vlambeer. The firm's \"business and development guy\" Rami Ismail told Engadget that Facebook was the \"household name\" Oculus needed. \"Facebook is a huge established tech presence, has amazing engineers, hardware, software, public mind-share and lots of money,\" he said. \"I mean, I am not a big fan of exits as a business model at all, but in light of not really having a profitable business model, it makes total sense for them to exit.\" Oculus Rift's development was possible thanks to crowdfunding - 9,522 backers pledged $2,437,429 (Â£1.5m) to get the product off the ground. Many of the product's early backers returned to the fund-raising page to give their opinions on the buyout. \"Shame on you Palmer, shame on you,\" wrote user Xod, referring to Palmer Luckey, Oculus VR's founder. \"A terrible move indeed, I'm so upset at the idea that this great community of generous people kickstarted Facebook. Believing you'll keep full control on Oculus and the Rift is very naive.\" Another user, Drew Madson, wrote: \"I backed this concept in the hopes they'd make something wonderful. Sadly all they did was make themselves wonderfully rich.\" But others were more optimistic, and congratulated the team on the sale. \"It's going to take significant resources to make VR truly mainstream,\" wrote backer Jeff McMorris. \"I am not sure why everyone's so upset.

{"article": "His report was an intimate look at life in the most troubled parts in the south and west of the Illinois city, where most homicides occur, where rival gangs war with one another over matters both large and small - with deadly consequences. While conceding there are many significant differences between an active war zone like Syria and the streets of Englewood or Austin, where Pannell visited, he still noticed some similarities. He spoke with BBC News' Jessica Lussenhop about what he saw. War becomes a way of life \"People live with a threat or elements of danger, and although the degree is completely different, that's similar for civilian populations in both environments. \"So what you see is, externally you can go into war zones and on days when things aren't happening, it can look very normal. \"What always amazes me - you see this in Chicago and you see this in places like Syria - is people, they'll be out on the street, they'll be doing the shopping, but they know the rules. As soon as trouble starts to happen, they will immediately withdraw. Suddenly everybody disappears. \"Someone in Chicago was telling me, 'the mailman knows.' The mailman or mailwoman will not go down some of those streets on the days when they know there's an active beef going on. And it's the same in war zones - people learn to adapt, but that has psychological consequences. \"People won't give up. But they live with levels of trauma and danger and stress that aren't normal, and you can't live with that much threat and that much danger on a regular basis and it not affect you.\" The power of guns \"I've never seen so many weapons in civilian hands outside of a traditional war zone as I did in parts of Chicago. \"I've never seen a readiness to use firearms outside of a traditional war zone like I've seen in areas of the city. So many people have guns and the threshold beyond which you are prepared to use a weapon is incredibly low. \"In a war zone you would expect people to be armed, you're ready to use it and there's a high chance you're going to be in a situation where you have to use it. In Chicago, you have kids who are empowered by weapons, who are empowered by shooting, given a kind of status that otherwise they don't have. \"In Syria, there are a lot of young, under-employed or unemployed men who became part of rebel groups not just because they believed in the struggle, but it gave them status. It gave them a weapon. It gave them a role. It gave them meaning. \"It's the same thing in Chicago - it's the same thing with the gangs.\" The impact on children \"Childhood ends early in both these places. \"People who perpetrate violence ultimately don't really care. For them, it's 'collateral damage'. \"In Chicago, collateral damage is six-year-old Tacarra Morgan, who was shot in the stomach while playing outside her house, and the collateral damage in Syria is also the kids on hospital slabs who were shot or shelled while playing in their streets. When the child rescuers die too \"Kids have become desensitized to violence. Someone's been shot, and kids are playing up and down the streets on their bikes, because they're used to seeing it and that's also what you see in a war zone. \"It means if the time comes and someone offers to put a gun in their hands, that they are simply more ready to embrace a life of violence. The threshold where you'd be willing to pick up a gun and shoot someone has been massively reduced.\" Young men with no way out \"In west Chicago, it's the closest I've ever felt in a civilian area to being in a hostile environment in the way these guys operate. \"They work in a group, all looking out, they're all looking around in every direction, watching for things coming.

The ruling Law and Justice party has been criticised by the European Union over its reforms of the judiciary, surveillance, and media laws. The party rejects the accusations. Saturday's demonstration in the Polish capital was organised by Committee for the Defence of Democracy (KOD). People blew horns and waved both Polish and EU flags as they walked through central Warsaw. The opposition said about 50,000 people took part in the protest.

But they also wanted to voice their opposition to what they see as the government's backsliding on democracy, the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw reports. The Polish government passed legal amendments late last year which change the way the Constitutional Court operates. The changes require a two-thirds majority of the 15 judges to support a ruling for it to be valid, and also stipulate a quorum of 13 judges for rulings to be valid. Critics have said the changes mean the court is now unable to examine government legislation. The European Commission and the  Council of Europe say the changes undermine the rule of law. Recently approved media laws have also placed public radio and TV under a new national media council and have given the treasury minister the right to hire and fire management.

{"article": "He was talking about the retailer's efforts to drive its stores upmarket and \"elevate its retail proposition\". The idea is to give more space over to branded goods and showcase their \"very best products\", even opening gyms in some of the flagship stores. And on Thursday it announced a \"strategic partnership\" with upmarket Japanese sportswear brand Asics, whose products will be stocked in Asics-managed areas of flagship stores from next year. Sports Direct described this as \"an important step in Sports Direct's journey to being recognised as the Selfridges of sport.'\" Well, there was only one way to find out what this was all about - take a visit to its flagship store on London's Oxford Street, which is showcasing the latest approach. As I walked through the door, to be greeted by thumping music,  I dredged through my memory for the last time I'd been in a Sports Direct. It was a long time ago, but my memory was of the slightly claustrophobic feel of fighting through a crowded jumble of kit and equipment, and my perception, right or wrong, that this was an environment aimed primarily at men. So the fact that the Oxford Street store felt light and airy with plenty of space between rails was a welcome relief. But let's be honest, I'm not a typical Sports Direct customer. Yes, I exercise regularly, but fashion is not foremost in my mind when I'm struggling through another tortuous workout, and I think of Sports Direct as being more about fashion than \"serious\" sport. Could I be converted? Well, first off, reinforcing my prejudice that this is more of a male environment, the first thing you see as you walk through the door of the Oxford Street store is a display of club strips and a sign proclaiming this is \"The Home of Football\",  a reminder that another of Sports Direct's stated aims is to become just that - the home of football. And most of the customers did seem to be male. Of course, a key element of shopping is how the staff treat you. Would I be made to feel welcome? As I wandered aimlessly, an assistant did offer to help me, so a big tick there. What would happen if I tried to buy something. New boxing gloves. Could I get an assistant to advise me? Yes, as it turned out. A smiley young woman confidently explained the point of the different glove weights. OK, once I'd said I would buy them she tried to sell me a special offer on some \"workout make up\" but was quite happy when I said I'd think about it. So how about trying to buy something for my sartorially conservative husband? On the floor below there was no price on the black T-shirt I chose. But another assistant spent a good few minutes checking out the price on the website. Ticks all round for my experience of the staff I came up against, anyway. So then I waylaid shoppers as they left the store to gauge their reactions. Rory Bryant, a teacher who used to work in advertising, had come into buy some socks. He had spotted the shift upmarket and was impressed by the lighter feel, \"compared to most Sports Direct stores\". \"Most are a jumble of crumpled socks and piles of clothing,\" he says. Photographers' agent James Denton, 49, had been in the Oxford Street store for the first time. He came out with a football for his two-year old son. He said he normally thought of the chain as a slightly downmarket depressing experience. \"so it definitely feels different\". \"Stuff is a lot better laid out, they've put a lot of thought into design and layout of everything,\" he added. Another customer, Philip Yardy, described the design of the shops as \"open, appealing\" and encouraging people to walk through. But Stuart Deveson wasn't quite so happy. He spent all of 10 seconds in there, he said. He agreed the entrance to the shop \"looks quite nice\", but said the reason he had walked out so quickly was because he'd gone in to buy shorts and couldn't find them. \"If they're not going to make it easy to find what I want, I'll go somewhere else,\" he said. Sports Direct now has more than 25 new generation stores, of which 12 are \"flagship\" outlets. It plans to open between 16 and 24 new stores in the current financial year, of which about half will be flagship stores. So is Sports Direct \"smashing it out of the park\" with its \"Selfridges of Sport\" concept? Financial analysts seem happy enough with how it's going. Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said this had been a \"transformational\" year for Sports Direct. Progress was being made on the new premium stores, he said, and they were \"a lot more profitable than the existing Sports Direct stores\". Initial impressions from the shoppers I spoke to at least do seem positive. Perhaps the last word should go to customer Rory Bryant, who compared the Oxford Street flagship with another retail success story. He said it was now \"more like Niketown up the road\", and perhaps that, as much as Selfridges, is the inspiration behind the chain's makeover.", "question": "\" It 's clear we have smashed the ball out of the park with our ' Selfridges ' of sport concept , \" boasted Sports Direct chief executive Mike Ashley to financial analysts , following the release of the @placeholder 's latest results .", "option_0": "country", "option_1": "company", "option_2": "public", "option_3": "world", "option_4": "organisation", "label": 1}
{"article": "Manager Claudio Ranieri this week received a vote of confidence, the club insisting he retains their \"unwavering support\". But Leicester's fall has been a dramatic one, leaving them one point and two places above the bottom three. So what has changed for the champions, and why are things going wrong for a manager who only two months ago was named coach of the year at the Best Fifa Football Awards? News app users should click this link to vote The vote closes at 17:00 GMT and results will be available on this page shortly afterwards. It is 79 years since the top-flight title winners have dropped into the second tier 12 months after winning the league, but that is the prospect facing Leicester after the worst title defence ever seen. The Foxes have yet to win away in the league all season and have started 2017 with a run of five league games without a goal. No other top-flight team has endured such a miserable run since Tottenham, 31 years ago. It is a staggering contrast to their results in 2015-16, when they lost only three league matches throughout the campaign. In fact, at the start of this season, they had lost only three times in their previous 47 Premier League games. And don't forget - they did not just win the league last season, they ended up walking it by 10 points. But since August things have unravelled fast and they have lost 13 out of 24 matches, winning just five times. Would you be surprised to find out Jamie Vardy's conversion rate is actually better this season than it was during the title campaign? Vardy scored 24 Premier League goals in 2015-16, form that saw him named Football Writers' Footballer of the Year and shortlisted for the Ballon d'Or and Fifa's own player of the year award. This season he has only five league goals, three of which came in one game against Manchester City, and has scored in only one league game since 10 September - a run of 17 matches. But he is actually more clinical this year. The problem, it seems, is he is simply not getting the chances. This season, on average, he gets one opportunity every two matches, whereas last season it was more than one per game. While the evidence points to the lack of a supply line (fewer shots, fewer chances), there has also been the suggestion Vardy is not making the runs that proved so successful last season. Ian Stringer, who covers the Foxes for BBC Radio Leicester, said: \"Jamie Vardy haring around is a sight to behold, but it seems rare this season. \"I think that's due to his chances being few and far between; he can't run in behind if he's not being slotted in.\" The stats actually show that Vardy is working as hard as last season - covering exactly the same average distance per game - and he is even making more sprints than last year. The ball is simply not finding him when he does. And certainly not in dangerous areas. Riyad Mahrez's attacking excellence in 2015-16 earned him the PFA Player of the Year award, as well as seeing him named BBC African Footballer of the Year. That recognition came after a season in which he scored 17 goals and provided assists for a further 11. This year, his return from 22 matches is three goals - all penalties - and two assists. So what is he doing differently? Last season, many of his goals and assists came from trickery and mazy dribbling. This season, he is simply not showing those same skills. And, of course, there is the collapse of his previously lethal link-up play with Vardy, a combination that led to seven goals last season (ie one player directly assisting the other). In October, the pair famously went on a run of eight game in which they passed to each other only twice. That has improved since then - but to no great effect. In the six Premier League games they have played together since the start of December, Mahrez has found Vardy 16 times (including five times against Manchester United on Sunday). But it is not leading to goals and, remarkably, the pair have combined for just one goal in the past 12 months. It always seemed likely Leicester would lose one, two or maybe all of their three star performers last season. They kept hold of Vardy after he turned down the chance to move to Arsenal, but the Foxes were powerless to prevent N'Golo Kante leaving for Chelsea for around £30m, as he reportedly had a release clause in his contract. For a team so reliant on playing on the counter-attack, Kante's ability to break up opposition attacks and protect the back four was a cornerstone of their success. The Foxes have tried to fill that void, using Daniel Amartey and new signings Nampalys Mendy and Wilfred Ndidi in his central midfield position. And while Kante has long been noted for his energetic style and ability to cover so much ground, his replacements have more or less matched - and in Mendy's case bettered - his workrate. But it is Kante's ability to disrupt the opposition's play that they simply have not been able to replace. As Watford striker Troy Deeney said earlier this season: \"You can get through their midfield and get at their back four a little bit easier now. \"Whenever we broke on them last season, I always had the fear factor that Kante was coming back and I knew we didn't have much time before he got there. \"Even if I actually did have time, I always thought he might be there, so I would rush things a bit. \"I always felt Kante did the work of two players.\" Perhaps the biggest impact of Kante's departure has been on Leicester's defensive solidity. While last season they kept 15 clean sheets in their 38 games and became notorious for eking out 1-0 wins - they managed seven in total - this term they have been conceding far more regularly and have won 1-0 only once. Their backline is an ageing one - centre-backs Wes Morgan and Robert Huth are 33 and 32 respectively - and they are frequently finding themselves exposed. And it does not help that the team appear to be working less hard as a unit. \"Leicester in recent years have been a team built on effort, going back to their League One days,\" said Stringer. \"All that seems to have disappeared. \"While I'm not questioning the desire or effort, it's the physical exertion which seems less - understandable when you've lost a player like Kante who's dominating the tackles and distances-made charts.\" And the stats back up the argument that their workrate has dipped. They are collectively running an average of 2.1km less per game than they were last season. Leicester used fewer playerslast season - 23 - than any other Premier League team, with Ranieri making a total of 33 changes to his starting line-up over the course of 38 games, the fewest in the division. This season, with things going wrong from the outset (an opening-day defeat against a Hull side in disarray), the Italian has reverted to being the 'Tinkerman', a nickname picked up while in charge at Chelsea. There are, of course, mitigating factors. This season, the Foxes have played five more games in all competitions than at the same stage 12 months ago, with Ranieri having to consider the demands of Champions League football on his squad. He also lost Amartey, Mahrez and Islam Slimani to Africa Cup of Nations duty, making changes inevitable. But it is not just the players who have changed regularly - Ranieri has also started tinkering with his formation. The 4-4-2 set-up that brought them so much success last season has been replaced in recent weeks, and Leicester have started with a different formation in each of their past four games. That has widely been perceived as a failing of Ranieri's, confusing his players and sending mixed messages - the Italian himself conceding they were struggling to adapt after a 3-0 defeat at Southampton in January. \"Maybe my players didn't understand my idea very well,\" he reflected. But perhaps Ranieri was actually too slow to identify his side's problems, and too reluctant to move away from 4-4-2. While many teams adapt their formation depending on the opposition (Tottenham and Manchester City are just two of the sides to have played three at the back against Chelsea's system this season), Ranieri had avoided doing that. In fact, of the 18 Premier League teams to have used more than one formation in 2016-17 (Arsenal and Liverpool have not altered theirs), Leicester were the last to change. Ranieri is making up for lost time though. Since his first instance of tinkering - a 1-0 win against West Ham on 31 December - he has yet to choose the same formation in back-to-back fixtures. So after their dismal start to 2017, will Leicester be able to reproduce the kind of end to the season that saved them in 2014-15, when they recovered from being bottom and seven points adrift with nine games to play? They are not in quite such serious trouble yet this time around, and Stringer expects them to do enough to stay in the Premier League. \"I think this will be a watershed for them,\" he says. \"Many of the current crop have experience of escaping relegation, and experience of doing it with this team.

{"article": "Gabriel Sakellaridis was speaking after Mr Tsipras won the late-night vote convincingly, but with more than 30 of his own MPs voting against him. The vote means the government lost its majority but is expected to survive. Eurozone finance ministers are due to discuss the vote in a conference call. On Wednesday the European Commission proposed a €7bn (£5bn) \"bridging\" loan to help Greece pay debt interest due in several days. Live updates Under the terms of the bailout deal agreed in Brussels on Monday, the first tranche of legislation relating to tax and pensions had to be passed by Wednesday. The Greek parliament discussed the bailout deal beyond a midnight deadline into Thursday morning. Mr Tsipras won the vote by 229 votes to 64, with the support of some opposition MPs. See how events unfolded here The BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens says he has been weakened and will now need a reshuffle or a vote of confidence. Passionate opposition came from his own party, with parliamentary Speaker Zoe Constantopoulo calling the measures \"social genocide\". Former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis was another vocal opponent of the measures. Energy Minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and Deputy Labour Minister Dimitris Stratoulis also voted against the package, prompting speculation they could lose their jobs in a reshuffle. In his address to parliament Mr Tsipras said: \"I acknowledge the fiscal measures are harsh, that they won't benefit the Greek economy, but I'm forced to accept them.\" He added: \"The Greek people can understand the difference between those who fight in an unfair battle and those who just hand in their weapons.\" He also said it was a \"positive development\" that one of Greece's creditors, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), had suggested that the bailout does not go far enough - and that some debts will need to be written off. Mr Sakellaridis said the vote was the first important step towards a deal and hinted that the government would try to remain in office despite losing its majority. \"The basic priority of the prime minister and the government is the immediate and successful completion of the agreement,\" he said. When Eurozone finance ministers hold their conference call at 08:00 GMT they will discuss the next steps. Later, the European Central Bank's governing council will meet to discuss how to keep Greece's banks from collapsing. Greek banks have been closed for more than two weeks to reopen, with cash withdrawals limited to €60 a day. For Greece to secure its new funds, it must win the approval of the domestic parliaments of several of the other 18 members of the eurozone. Germany is expected to vote on the deal on Friday. Greece must also commit to a major overhaul of the civil justice system by 22 July and agree to more privatisation, to review collective bargaining and industrial action and to make market reforms, including Sunday trading. Thursday morning's vote approved: Opponents of the bailout measures took to the streets of Athens in mainly peaceful protests ahead of the vote.

The New Zealand-born player also started at full-back in the group-stage loss to Australia after making his debut as a replacement fly-half in a pre-tournament friendly against Ireland. He could be in line for another appearance at full-back against Ireland in Dublin in February if Liam Williams is not fit, despite being seen more as a fly-half by his region. \"There's a lot of competition for places in that [Wales] team, that's really helped with the performance of that team over the last couple of years\" said Anscombe. \"Liam's a quality player and he's coming back from that foot injury, and Hallam [Amos] certainly showed what he can do [in his try-scoring return for the Dragons].

{"article": "Peter Davison, who played the Doctor from 1981 to 1984, said he \"liked the idea\" of a male Doctor and that he felt \"a bit sad\" the character might no longer be \"a role model for boys\". His comments were promptly dubbed \"rubbish\" by his successor Colin Baker. \"You don't have to be of a gender to be a role model,\" said the actor, who portrayed the Doctor from 1984 to 1986. \"Can't you be a role model as people?\" The actors were speaking on Thursday at Comic-Con, the world's largest celebration of film, TV and pop culture. Baker, the father of four daughters, said the BBC show's 54-year history had given young male viewers plenty of figures to emulate. \"They've had 50 years of having a role model,\" said the 74-year-old. \"So sorry Peter, you're talking rubbish there - absolute rubbish.\" Davison - whose own daughter Georgina is married to David Tennant, another ex-Doctor - accepted \"you need to open it up\" and that he was \"maybe an old-fashioned dinosaur\". The news that Whittaker will inherit the Tardis from Peter Capaldi this Christmas has been a major talking point at the San Diego event. John Barrowman asked fans to give the Broadchurch actress a chance while making his own Comic-Con appearance on Thursday. \"If we buy into the world of Doctor Who... it doesn't say that he will be a he all the time,\" said the actor. Barrowman, who played Captain Jack Harkness in the programme and its spin-off Torchwood, donned a glittery mini-dress modelled on the Tardis while appearing at the San Diego Convention Centre. Closer to home, Whittaker's casting as the 13th Doctor continues to animate other former stars of the long-running series. Freema Agyeman, another former companion of the TV time-traveller, said she was \"overjoyed\" that a woman had finally landed the role. \"I feel like standing on top of a rooftop and shouting for joy,\" said the actress, who confessed to being \"astounded\" by the \"furore\" that the casting announcement had generated. \"The strength of the show and the reason for its longevity is the way it keeps changing and shifting,\" she told the BBC this week. Agyeman, who played Martha Jones opposite Tennant's Doctor, will shortly be seen in Apologia at London's Trafalgar Studios alongside The West Wing's Stockard Channing. Earlier this week it was revealed in the BBC's annual report that Capaldi was paid between Â£200,000 and Â£250,000 last year for his role in the series. In an interview with the London Evening Standard, BBC director general Tony Hall said Whittaker would be paid the same as her predecessor \"for the same amount of work\".

{"article": "France objected to the design showing the Lion Hill memorial, which marks the June 1815 battle near Brussels. The French government said it contained a \"negative symbol\" for some Europeans. Belgium's finance ministry said that 175,000 coins had already been minted with the new design and would not now be brought into circulation. Napoleon's dream of a united Europe under French rule finally came to an end at Waterloo, where he was defeated by an allied force commanded by the Duke of Wellington and Prussia's Field Marshal Bluecher. A letter of objection to the coin submitted by France argued that the battle was an event with particular resonance in the European collective memory and went beyond being merely an instance of military conflict. The €2 (£1.4; $2.1) coins could prompt an unfavourable reaction in France, the letter warned, at a time when eurozone governments were trying to strengthen unity and co-operation. One diplomat expressed surprise that two centuries after the French defeat a proposal for \"some loose change with an image of a hill on it can cause such a fuss in Paris\", the BBC's Chris Morris in Brussels reports. A source at the Royal Mint told the BBC: \"The Battle of Waterloo ended 200 years ago, but now they are starting it all over again.\" Manuela Wintermans of the National Union of Public Services told Belgian TV the Royal Mint had given in to the French protest. She complained it would be irresponsible to halt distribution of the coins when so many had been minted. But Belgian authorities said that after the French objection they would not have been able to secure the support of sufficient eurozone member states for the coin under the system of qualified majority voting. And Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt said he was a little surprised by the fuss, pointing out that Europe had plenty of other challenges \"without wasting time and energy on this\".

{"article": "Over the past 10 years, it has expanded its domestic influence but also become entangled in Syria's civil war. Here are ways it has changed in some key areas. Hezbollah transformed from a party with limited power to a potent political heavyweight. It led a series of protests in late 2006 to demand greater decision-making power in cabinet. In 2008, Hezbollah-led militants initiated clashes in Beirut after the government threatened to shut down its private telecommunications network, eventually acquiring veto power in cabinet. The party dismissed the legitimacy of an international tribunal investigating the 2005 killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which indicted five Hezbollah members. It remained steadfast in the face of public dissent and a violent domestic backlash, manifested in sectarian clashes and bombings, over its involvement in the Syrian civil war. For two years, Hezbollah has also used its veto power to prevent the election of a Lebanese president whom it does not favour. Hezbollah underwent a significant shift, developing new capabilities and growing its ranks through its intervention in Syria, moving away from a purely Lebanon-Israel focus. Its weapons arsenal grew from from 33,000 rockets and missiles before the 2006 war to an estimated 150,000. Similarly, it swelled from a few thousand members in 2006 to an estimated 20,000-plus. After 2011, Hezbollah's military support for the Iran-backed Syrian government - its weapons supply line - gave its fighters considerable combat experience and exposure to Russian military planning. Hezbollah also trained pro-Iranian forces in Yemen and Iraq. But it lost some of its highest-ranking officials in Syria, and found itself fighting Sunni extremist groups on Lebanese soil. Hezbollah incurred financial losses from targeted sanctions and increased military expenditures. Several governments also linked Hezbollah to international drug trafficking rings and money laundering, claims the group has denied. It receives substantial financial and arms support from Iran. In 2016, Lebanese banks began to comply with a US law targeting Hezbollah's finances, closing down hundreds of Hezbollah-linked accounts. Reports suggest it has struggled to pay compensation to families of fighters killed or injured in Syria. Tensions between Hezbollah and Arab states soared. Hezbollah was condemned by most Arab governments for its \"adventurism\" in the July 2006 war. It still enjoyed considerable popular support across the Arab world, however, for fighting a \"common enemy\" - Israel. A decade later, the Arab League, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) all branded Hezbollah a \"terrorist\" organisation. In the eyes of predominantly Sunni Arab Gulf states, Hezbollah transformed into a Shia force killing Sunnis in Syria. Relations between Saudi Arabia - which also backs an anti-Hezbollah political bloc in Lebanon - and Hezbollah were particularly hard hit. Hezbollah maintained its use of media as a political tool. In July 2006, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah asked viewers of its TV channel Al-Manar to watch as a burning Israeli warship sunk off the shores of Beirut. The group has since developed an all-encompassing, offensive media strategy in its coverage of regional conflicts, alongside a surge in pro-Hezbollah social media pages. Its discourse expanded from \"resistance\" against Israel to include sectarian messaging against Sunni extremism. Its media machine came under attack in 2015-16 when two leading Arab satellites took Al-Manar TV off air. But Hezbollah also launched a largely successful venture in 2009 when it opened its war museum in south Lebanon, attracting locals and tourists alike.

{"article": "Within Italy, though, the former prime minister remains a potent political force. His centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party has been gaining ground, and he may well be in the reckoning when this weekend's election results roll in. So, what is the secret of his enduring attraction? Some of his faithful followers in Italy's affluent north explain why they have stayed loyal, despite all the scandal. Another, meanwhile, explains why he has finally had enough. Mr Bianchi describes himself as one of life's \"gypsies\". He's travelled the world during a career that's included the Italian diplomatic service, shipping and finance industries. He now works as a training consultant to big firms from his home in Milan. Mr Bianchi has been a Berlusconi fan since the former cruise-ship crooner exploded onto the political scene in 1994 - and he remains one to this day. He even supports Mr Berlusconi's AC Milan. \"This was a man who'd come from virtually nothing to be a big success in building, finance, the media - and had spotted a gap in the political market. He also opened up politics - to businessmen, academics and managers. And I like his easy way with people. What he's found, though, is that the Italian political system is very difficult to change, because of the resistance of the political system and vested interests. \"The way he's been attacked over the years has infuriated me. They started out trying to attack him on issues that seemed important - and when that didn't work, they ended up talking about the girls and the parties. \"What he has now - in addition to his business expertise - is 20 years' experience of politics. And that could be invaluable at this difficult time. In fact, I believe in him now even more than in the past.\" Mr Ferri is single, and a marketing graduate. Home is a small village called Comun Nuova, in the Po valley. His day starts at 06:00 in the morning, when he sets off for work at the nearby Tenaris steel plant. Four evenings a week he studies for his masters degree in international marketing. \"Berlusconi's no saint, we all know that. But there's a saying in Italian - 'ci mette la faccia' - which basically means someone's not afraid of a fight, of taking a risk. And that's Berlusconi all over. He has no fear. \"Before he came back as leader - just before the election - the PDL was down and out. Now it's back and fighting hard. The PDL might still lose - but it would have been a lot worse without Berlusconi. \"Berlusconi is the only one who knows how to talk to people about their real problems. You know, we've businessmen round here who've lost everything they've worked to build up over the past 40 years - men who can't even afford a decent meal any more. \"And the other parties - on the left - they want to talk about gay weddings. I mean - what planet are they on? They've no experience of the real world. The only world most of them know is the world of politics.\" Ms Birolini is running for election to the Lombardy regional council on the PDL ticket. A 43-year-old mother of two, she's passionate about culture, the importance of rooting out corruption and the role of women in Italian society. How does that sit with her place in a party led by a man known for constant corruption allegations - and a taste for dancing girls? \"Berlusconi is not the PDL. The reason I'm in the PDL is because it represents freedom of choice - and it's only by the exercise of choice that you become a better citizen. Berlusconi did a lot for the country in his first 10 years. But after that, I think he got misled by some of those around him. \"It's really difficult to be a woman in the centre-right at the moment because some of the examples in the past were so bad. We're all 'messo nello stesso cappello' - thrown together in the same hat. It's my personal battle to show that a woman can make a valid contribution politically, that there's a different way to be a woman in politics on the centre-right. It's a heavy responsibility - especially at a time like this. \"But the top priority after the election has to be to tackle corruption. The worst thing is the way it's insinuated its way into society - so that ordinary people end up thinking it's not really criminal behaviour, just a way of doing business.\" Mr Marieni is a property owner and retired manager, whose family home is in the town of Bergamo, just outside Milan. He's a firm believer in free-market liberalism - and had great hopes for Silvio Berlusconi when he first appeared on the political scene. But this time, he says, he won't be voting PDL. \"I voted for him because he seemed to be the only person who could prevent Italy being taken over by the communists or ex-communists. I think he had a genuine desire to renew the country - to slash bureaucracy and shake up the public administration, education and health. He also saw the need to modernise our infrastructure in order to catch up with the rest of Europe - everything from high-speed train networks and motorways to nuclear power plants and high-speed internet access. \"But the establishment - most of it on the left - was against all this - and so started the battle against him - like antibodies fighting off alien intruders in the body. \"Now, though, I think his time is over.

Another Mexican Leo Santa Cruz handed Frampton his first career defeat in Las Vegas as he avenged the Northern Irishman's victory in New York last July. Media playback is not supported on this device Frampton has admitted that a second straight defeat could leave his career running out of road but the two-weight world champion says he believes he is in shape to knock out the dangerous Mexican. Gutierrez is something of a knockout specialist himself having clinched 24 KO wins in his 35-contest career. His only career loss was a controversial points defeat by another Mexican Cristian Mijares 13 months ago while his record also includes a draw from six years ago.

{"article": "\"There was no precedent. If I asked somebody, 'What do you expect me to do?' they all looked blank. They had no idea, nobody had much idea.\" Over the years, the duke has involved himself with more than 800 different organisations. But he was very reluctant to talk about himself and his achievements to Fiona Bruce in a special BBC One programme to mark his 90th birthday and refused to say what he was most proud of. The Duke at 90 is on BBC One on 9 June at 2100 BST. The Duke at 90 \"I couldn't care less,\" he said when asked if he thought he had been successful in his role. \"Who cares what I think about it, I mean it's ridiculous.\" One of Prince Philip's most successful initiatives has been to create The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, which has stretched the capabilities of more than seven million young people globally since 1956. But he said he could not take credit for the highly successful scheme. \"I don't run it - I've said it's all fairly secondhand the whole business. I mean, I eventually got landed with the responsibility or the credit for it. \"I've got no reason to be proud of it. It's satisfying that we've set up a formula that works - that's it.\" The duke was also a champion of the early environmental movement and was the first president of the World Wildlife Fund. He was more happy to open up about his passion for conservation. \"If we've got this extraordinary diversity on this globe it seems awfully silly for us to destroy it. All these other creatures have an equal right to exist here, we have no prior rights to the Earth than anybody else and if they're here let's give them a chance to survive.\" But he said he would not describe himself as green: \"I think that there's a difference between being concerned for the conservation of nature and being a bunny hugger...  people who simply love animals. \"People can't get their heads round the idea of a species surviving, you know, they're more concerned about how you treat a donkey in Sicily or something.\" He said he believed the growing human population was the biggest challenge to conservation and \"voluntary family limitation\" was the only way to tackle it. The duke's comments on the environment reflect his reputation for plain speaking. \"He always speaks his mind, sometimes not necessarily with a high degree of tact,\" says his cousin Countess Mountbatten. \"But on the other hand, I think that people have come to expect that of him, and they really rather enjoy it and they think, how nice to hear somebody actually say what they think.\" For decades the duke has made off-the-cuff remarks that have been reported around the world. On a tour to China, he quipped to British students, off the record, that if they stayed in China much longer they would come back with slitty eyes. When Fiona Bruce suggested that some people may have thought he should not have said that, he replied: \"It has no effect in China if that's what you're worried about.\" Pushed on what he felt about the comment, he admitted: \"I'd forgotten about it.\" So does he feel the press has been unfair to him or misrepresented him? \"I suppose, yes, occasionally but I think it has its own agenda and, and that's it, you just have to live with it.\" Prince Philip admitted he did not want to be interviewed by the BBC for a documentary to commemorate his 90th birthday and Fiona Bruce's attempts to delve into his early years were given short shrift. As a member of the exiled Greek royal family he had a nomadic childhood living in France, England and Germany. Asked if that was unsettling, he replied: \"Well I just lived my life - I haven't been trying to psychoanalyse myself all the time.\" Aged just 10, Prince Philip was separated from every member of his immediate family, as they moved to live in different countries. But he said that was \"no great deal\". His reluctance to speak about all aspects of his life is due to modesty, according to his son, Prince Edward. \"My father plain and simply is very modest about himself and doesn't believe in talking about himself. One of his best pieces of advice he gives to everybody is talk about everything else, don't talk about yourself - nobody's interested in you.\" At 90, Prince Philip said he was \"winding down\" his involvement with charities. \"I reckon I've done my bit so I want to enjoy myself a bit now, with less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say. On top of that your memory's going, I can't remember names and things,\" he admitted. \"It's better to get out before you reach the sell-by date.\" The Duke at 90 was broadcast on BBC One on Thursday 9 June at 2100 BST, and is available on BBC iPlayer.", "question": "Prince Philip , the Duke of Edinburgh , has stood at the Queen 's side for nearly 60 years .

{"article": "A Commons Justice Committee report says offenders aged between 18 and 25 are 10 times more likely to have a learning disability or autistic disorder. It said a \"lack of action\" on these offenders had led many to re-offend. The government said \"significant efforts\" had been made to prevent young people ending up in prison. The committee's report argues there is a strong case for treating young adult offenders differently because their brains are still developing up to the age of 25 - meaning they are more likely to act impulsively and not weigh up the long-term effects. It also found those still offending into adulthood were more likely to have learning difficulties or communication disorders, or to have suffered head injuries. It said flawed interventions, set up by the Ministry of Justice and carried out by the National Offender Management Service, did not recognise young adults' needs and prevented them getting out of a cycle of crime. The young adults tired of offending The terror of young offender institutions The number of young adults in the criminal justice system, who are mostly men, has fallen in recent years, but figures suggest 18 to 25-year-olds still account for up to 40% of the criminal caseload. They also have the highest reconviction rate, with 75% returning to crime within two years of being released. But the report argued that, while those in this age group offended the most, they also had the greatest potential to stop offending as they \"grow out of crime\". It said age and maturity should be taken into significantly greater account within the criminal justice system and should presume that up to the age of 25 young adults were typically still maturing. The committee said it welcomed the Ministry of Justice's commitment to develop a maturity assessment when dealing with young offenders but said that not screening for mental disorders and learning and communication needs was a \"missed opportunity\". \"This is short-sighted as such screening would enable a thorough understanding of individual needs and underpin better informed commissioning decisions for the services young adults need to address their offending,\" the report said. Alex Hewson, of the Prison Reform Trust, said: \"A justice system which throws young people off a cliff edge on their 18th birthday, and expects them to fend for themselves in the adult system when they are still maturing and often vulnerable, is not one that is set up to deliver for offenders, victims or local communities.\" A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \"Significant efforts have been made to divert young people from custody and this has resulted in a welcome reduction in the prison population - down 40% since 2010. But those in custody are in for longer and for more serious offences. \"We recognise the specific challenges associated with this age group and are committed to addressing these.\"", "question": "There needs to be a major change in dealing with young adult offenders , MPs have said , based on @placeholder that shows their brains are still developing .", "option_0": "suggests", "option_1": "evidence", "option_2": "news", "option_3": "show", "option_4": "beaches", "label": 1}
{"article": "US Attorney General Loretta Lynch laid the case out clearly: \"Unfortunately, sadly, tragically, a number of corrupt officials treated this public trust as a personal bank account.\" The lawsuit alleged that those named in the suit were responsible for the fraud. But it also mentioned a \"Malaysian Official 1\" more than 30 times, and alleged that this official received some $681m of the stolen money, and returned most of it. From the details in the suit, it was widely understood that \"Malaysian Official 1\" is Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, but it was never officially confirmed. But in an interview with me, Abdul Rahman Dahlan,  a senior government minister in Mr Najib's cabinet, said \"I agree that 'MO1' is the prime minister\". \"I've said it openly. Obviously if you read the documents, people say it is the prime minister,\" he said. \"But when I have been asked this question, I always ask back: why didn't the DOJ name him by his proper name? That reason is because he is not part of this investigation. \"It is not about him. It is about a bunch of people who have been namedâ€¦. and the Department of Justice will take this to the courts and let the courts decide.\" In itself, the admission simply confirms what most Malaysians - at least those who know about the 1MDB scandal - already believe. The DOJ's report led to outrage on social media, with many netizens cheekily asking for the real \"Malaysia official 1\" to \"please stand up\". The frustration is slowly but surely spilling out onto Malaysia's streets. Just a few days ago, a protest organised by students and activists called for the arrest of Malaysian Official 1. Carrying posters of Mr Najib with the words \"MO1\" emblazoned on them, protesters said he must step down even if he isn't directly involved in the fraud, because it took place under his watch. Mr Najib set up 1MDB in 2009 and, until recently, was the chair of the advisory board. The fund was supposed to promote economic development in Malaysia, but ran into billions of dollars of debt and has been considered a financial failure. But when I asked Mr Dahlan whether the prime minister should take responsibility for the fund's failure, the answer was a categorical no. \"He took responsibility...he has put a new team in 1MDB,\" he said. \"But just to say because a few NGOs  or opposition against the PM are asking the PM to vacate his position is a bit too much.\" It is true that the protest was much smaller than organisers expected and it's unclear whether any more will follow. It's unlikely that Mr Najib will be hurt by these sorts of demonstrations: for now at least, they're too insignificant to make much of a difference. But there has been some damage to his international reputation, and that of Malaysia's, according to those who want him out. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is leading the charge. \"Today people laugh at Malaysia, they say what has happened to your country?\" he told me in an interview in his office in Kuala Lumpur. It's hard not to be sceptical about his sudden distaste for the current leader. After all, Mr Najib was handpicked and groomed by Mr Mahathir as his successor. And Mr Mahathir's critics argue that the corruption that he is now attacking flourished under his watch. \"Yes there was corruption. Corruption is found everywhere,\" he said to me. \"I admit there is some corruption in my staff - not me. During my time, we don't have corruption on this scale, described by the US as the biggest fraud and money laundering they have ever seen.\" Mr Najib's supporters say that Mr Mahathir's desire to push him out is driven by hidden motives - that he wants to secure a political legacy for his son, and that he is using the 1MDB case as a way to fuel anger amongst the Malaysian public. If it wasn't 1MDB, they say, it would be something else. But the fact remains that Mr Najib's reputation is now intricately tied to the way the 1MDB saga pans out. For now, Malaysians appear to be resigned to the news that their prime minister was in some way involved in this scandal. And the vast majority of Malaysians who live in the countryside have yet to fully understand the financial complexities behind what happened at 1MDB.

Such a ban currently applies to flights from eight other countries. Mr Laborde also said Islamic State (IS) fighters returning to Europe would be \"more dangerous\" than previous waves. IS has been losing territory in Syria and Iraq, and Mr Laborde said these fighters, originally from Europe, would be hardened from years of war. He said several European countries believe the rate of fighters returning has increased by a third over the past year. \"On average, these people are much more committed, more experienced and more skilled,\" he said. \"In spite of the travel restrictions, you will have a number of foreign terrorist fighters which will probably slip through the borders and go back, come back to these countries, especially with smuggling networks.\" However the number of new foreign recruits going to the region is thought to be down. The number of foreign fighters flowing to IS-controlled regions dropped by 90% in the past year, the US secretary of state said recently. Mr Laborde said he did not know whether IS had the capacity to carry out a laptop bomb attack, but he was sure that organised criminal groups could. He told a reporter from the Spanish news agency Efe that it might be \"one, two or three years\" but might be aided by the internet now being available on some flights.

The Federation of Small Businesses said those conclusions came as no surprise to regular users of the route. It said the line was a \"gift for local events\" and had provided a massive boost for visitor numbers. FSB senior development manager for the east of Scotland Gordon Henderson said the reopening of the line had come about due to grassroots campaigning. \"This is great encouragement for those in Fife campaigning for the Levenmouth rail link,\" he said. He added that the impact on local events in the Borders was clear to see. \"Scotrail put on extra services and extra carriages for the Melrose Sevens this year and they were packed, I was there,\" he said.

{"article": "That in essence is the message at the heart of Australia's asylum seeker policy. You might be seeking a new life in one of the world's richest countries but you'll wash up in one of the world's poorest. Papua New Guinea's Manus Island is a place Australia does not want the world to see. Dubbed by some \"the Guantanamo of the Pacific\", it is home to one of Australia's off-shore detention centres, where around a thousand asylum seekers are locked up. It is extremely difficult for journalists to get visas to go there. So we travelled undercover, posing as tourists. We managed to smuggle our camera past Australian officials and reach the camp. We found asylum seekers, their faces pressed against the fences, some of whom have been stuck in Manus for almost two years. Many have fled the misery of the world's war zones - such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - but now find themselves imprisoned, seemingly indefinitely. Manus Island is far from the Promised Land. Over the past year the detention centre has been at boiling point. There have been riots in which one Iranian asylum seeker was killed. Hundreds have been on hunger strike. Some even stitched their lips together in protest. One man reportedly swallowed razor blades in desperation. People on Manus are scared to talk. But we managed to speak to one Middle Eastern man, Ahmed (not his real name), who spent 18 months locked up inside the detention centre before being moved to a more open prison on Manus. \"My situation in detention was very, very, very terrible,\" Ahmed told us. \"We were living in one room two metres squared, four people. It's unfair. \"The Australian government broke the majority of our human rights. They don't have any plan for us.\" Ahmed told me he fled his home country, having tried to expose corruption inside the business where he was working. He also said he has publicly renounced Islam, something which could see him facing the death penalty back home. \"They will kill me if I go back,\" Ahmed said. He left his family behind but says he had no option. \"I have just one sister and I really love her. I love my parents and it is very hard to tolerate this situation without my family. But I don't have any choice. \"I am trying to start my life - my real life.\" Ahmed is one of around two dozen asylum seekers who have agreed to be resettled on Manus Island as a refugee. It meant he was able to leave the detention centre, but his situation has only marginally improved. He now lives in a heavily guarded  \"resettlement centre.\" Ahmed is allowed out and about in the day time; many of the refugees can be seen jogging or cycling along the roadside to pass the time. But he is not allowed to work, and he has to stick to a strict curfew between 6pm and 6am. Like many of the asylum seekers he is well educated, with a degree and a professional qualification. \"There are doctors, teachers, engineers, carpet makers. They are intelligent people. We could use their skills,\" one of the security guards on Manus told us. He didn't want to give his name for fear of losing his job. \"I feel sorry for them. They're human beings. They want their freedom.\" But to get that freedom, they might have to agree to make Papua New Guinea their home. In 2013, under the Labor government of Kevin Rudd, Australia did a deal with PNG, agreeing to pay the impoverished Pacific nation around AU$400m (US$300m; Â£200m) in aid if it agreed not only to house the detention centre but also to resettle refugees. The message was clear: asylum seekers trying to reach Australia's shores by boat, no matter how desperate, would not be resettled there. The Australian government defended the decision, saying the aim was deterrence, to stop desperate asylum seekers drowning at sea. It worked. Up until 2013 thousands of asylum seekers were trying to make the perilous journey to Australia by boat. Hundreds died in the process. Two years later, the number attempting the journey has been reduced to virtually zero. Australia's navy has engaged in a policy of forcibly turning boats back. And now the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has refused to deny reports that Australian officials had even resorted to paying people smugglers tens of thousands of dollars to abort their journeys. Some might say that's a bit like paying a bank robber, not to rob banks. But Mr Abbott said his government was using all manner of \"creative strategies\" to stop the boats, including methods that he described as \"by hook or by crook.\" On Manus Island reaction to Australia's policies is mixed. On the one hand the detention centre has provided hundreds of jobs for local people who work as security guards. But in terms of the AU$400m of aid promised for Papua New Guinea as part of the deal, many local people say they've seen little of that money. \"It is like boomerang aid,\" says Nahau Rooney, a community leader on Manus. \"They bring the money but Manus is getting maybe 1%, maybe 10%. But most of the major contracts are going to Australian companies.\" Australia's so-called Pacific solution has worked and is probably supported by the majority of Australians. It has stopped the boats. Tony Abbott has said Europe should be following Australia's example in tackling the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean. But the problem Europe is facing and the numbers involved are on a far, far greater scale. And Australia's policies have come at a cost to the country's reputation as a welcoming nation. Human rights groups have branded Australia's methods cruel and inhumane. The United Nations even said the treatment inside places like Manus Island was tantamount to torture. For the thousand or so asylum seekers stuck on Manus their future is bleak. They are the world's unwanted.

Car companies try to outdo each other on how fuel-efficient their models are. It impresses consumers because it's good for the environment, and it's easy on the wallet at the petrol station. Fuel efficiency is tested by putting cars on what is essentially a treadmill where they run at a certain speed and fuel consumption is measured. Mitsubishi appears to have overinflated the tyres, which gave better results on the fuel efficiency test. Imagine inflating your bicycle tyres to the maximum and going up a hill, then letting half the air out and going up the same hill again. It's much harder. The extra muscle you need gives you an idea of the extra fuel that a car would burn through. The controversy comes hard on the heels of the Volkswagen emissions scandal but is slightly different. Volkswagen installed hidden software in its diesel models that detected when an official emissions test was being conducted. The software would then lower the emission so the test readings were more favourable. So VW rigged the level of harmful gases coming from the exhaust pipe to make their cars look greener than they were. Mitsubishi rigged the fuel consumption readings so their cars would appear to use less fuel than they actually did. Mitsubishi is a somewhat confusing brand. There are a whole host of independent companies that share the name and trace their origins back to the original Mitsubishi company founded in 1870 in the shipping industry. The current companies though are entirely independent from each other. That means you will find the name in aviation, banking, air conditioners, the nuclear and chemical industry, optics and of course, cars. Mitsubishi Motors is the sixth biggest car maker in Japan and number 16 worldwide. Large-scale production got under way in the 1960s. In 1977 the company entered the European market and in 1982 the US market. Annual car production currently stands at 1,218,853 vehicles. The current scandal is at Mitsubishi Motors. Any damage to the brand name though, might spill over to the other companies. It's not the first time that Mitsubishi Motors has been in the headlines for misconduct. In the early 2000s, the company had to admit to lying about defects in its cars for decades. Back then, an internal investigation found that the firm had covered up faults since 1977 and repaired cars secretly, instead of reporting the problems to the transport ministry. The cover-up led to huge recalls, criminal charges against several employees and a cost of billions to the company.", "question": "Mitsubishi Motors has admitted rigging @placeholder on some of its models ' fuel efficiency .

{"article": "We are standing on board one of Hanjin's vessels. It's a huge ship, and the officer is second-in-command. He stares past me, for a moment lost in thought, an empty gaze across the hundreds of metres of containers and steel hull below. He quickly snaps out of it. \"Come this way please.\" We step inside, onto the bridge. If the engine room down below is the heart of this container giant, then up here is where its brains are. Powered down though, long rows of pale grey screens and control boards leave a silence interrupted only by our footsteps. The ship is docked in Singapore, finally. It's the first time in weeks it has been towed up alongside a pier. Hanjin Shipping went bankrupt in August and since then its vessels have been stranded at sea, not allowed to call at any port. It's the biggest bust the shipping industry has ever seen. Only once the company came under bankruptcy protection were the vessels (around 100 of them) eventually allowed to go into ports around the globe. Here in Singapore, a few of them have been trickling in over the past few days. We were able to make contact with one of them via another Hanjin captain back in South Korea. He got in touch with the first officer, who then talked the captain into allowing us on board - albeit reluctantly. There was one condition though: no disclosure of the ship's name, no photos, and no names of the crew members. As we get on board, it's the same young officer who greets us, no-one else is to be seen. Throughout the hour we spend on the ship, we never get to see the captain to ask him why he didn't want to let us on. After a few minutes with the first officer though, I'm beginning to see what might have been the reason. He is shy. In fact, there's a sense of suppressed embarrassment, shame almost, as we start talking to him. They are, after all, \"the company that went bust\". For years, the seamen have been proud to work for their company - only to suddenly find Hanjin now reduced to being the posterboy for their troubled industry. For most of us it is difficult to imagine what life in the shipping industry is like. After all, workers are often hundreds of miles away, out at sea. Here, following the officer down the silent linoleum corridors of this Hanjin vessel, the troubles facing him and his colleagues are very real. After the sudden shock of learning of their company's bankruptcy, and the weeks spent out at sea, the sailors now face even more uncertainty. \"We don't have a future,\" the first officer says quietly. \"When we arrive in Korea, we will stay maybe somewhere outside a port at sea. If the owner of the ship changes, then we will have to deliver this vessel. Then, we don't know what will happen to us.\" Our first officer politely guides us through the ship. We see the pantry, the kitchen, and the recreation room with its worn-out couches, a TV and PlayStation, and coffeemaker in the corner. Long corridors lie empty, bar a few pairs of shoes neatly placed in front of the doors to some private cabins. There are at least 10 floors, from deep down below deck to the bridge at the very top - where there's a stunning view of countless containers that look like oversized Lego blocks, laid out from right below us to the very front of the ship. From the pier, two gigantic cranes are slowly but steadily at work, picking up containers, lifting them as though they're made of cardboard. Not only do the crew know they will almost certainly be out of a job when they get to South Korea - it's also clear that getting another job in the industry will be very difficult. Like all the senior crew, the first officer has studied for four years at a maritime university. He has always been with Hanjin, starting out as a third officer and working his way up the ranks; the next step would have been captain. Captain of a proud vessel, with a prestigious company - a sought-after career. Analysts I speak to tell me the shipping industry takes a very long-term perspective. It has always been a cyclical industry and therefore will eventually pick up again, they say.

{"article": "Yet there were reserves of spirit, and grittiness and, it has to be acknowledged, good fortune, so that the triumph that had seemed as though it had slipped away from Inverness returned to them. Emotion spilled from that stand after the final whistle, along with Inverness manager John Hughes' twin daughters - Jessica and Victoria - who clambered over fans to be carried on to the pitch by their father. Joy was everywhere, although it would have been tinged with a heavy dose of relief. This was a moment of deserved glory for a club that has clambered its way to the upper echelons of the Scottish game through toil and sweat, but it came during a moment of doubt. Media playback is not supported on this device The first-half display had been full of intent, delivering a goal for Marley Watkins and suggesting that Hughes would guide his side to Inverness's first Scottish Cup. It was replaced in the second half by a sense of alarm, as unheralded Falkirk regrouped, played two up front, and scored an equaliser that was in keeping with the nature of the game. Even so, there is an indefinable quality to this Inverness side, something irrepressible. We saw it in the semi-final against Celtic, when they survived Josh Meekings' handball which should have brought a red card and a penalty, and went on to win the game despite conceding a late equaliser. It was evident again at Hampden, when they scored after being reduced to 10 men, and while struggling to cope with Falkirk's resurgence. Hughes could not wholly embrace the sense of achievement immediately after the final whistle, since the second-half performance of his side still irked him. Even so, the attributes that delivered the victory - heart, determination, even unexpected resourcefulness - were worth dwelling upon. It was James Vincent, the substitute who was supposed to be playing right-back, who was on hand inside the penalty area to convert the rebound when the Falkirk goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald parried Watkins' tame shot into his path. Afterwards, Hughes seemed incredulous at that turn of events, just as he did when his two full-backs, Graeme Shinnie and David Raven, combined to score the winning goal late on against Celtic in the semi-final. Yet that attitude, the refusal to bow to the circumstances, however challenging they may be, and to keep trying, is typical of Hughes and so also of his team. He is a deep thinker on the game, an idealist and at times a wonderfully expressive character. He bellowed at his players in the second-half, sometimes demanding that they run 10 or 20 yards to the touch line for instructions that were delivered with the sharp force and edge of a rebuke. They play for him, though, giving everything of themselves so that even when the odds were against them, they still found the means to triumph. Media playback is not supported on this device In Watkins they had the game's most threatening attacker. His pace was a constant worry to the Falkirk defenders, and Hughes understood how effective that threat would be since he set up his side to capitalise from it. He prepared his players for all scenarios during training last week, including being reduced to 10 men, but ultimately it was emotional qualities rather than logic or planning that brought the victory. Ross Draper and Greg Tansey were typically robust in central midfield, while Carl Tremarco was having an effective game at left-back before he stumbled on the ball and brought down Falkirk midfielder Blair Alston, leading to his second-half dismissal. Hughes did not build this side - the only player in the starting line-up that he signed was Edward Ofere - but he has made it more reliably effective. He is loud, boisterous, full of comical spirit, but also a proud and deeply committed football man. In so many respects, the achievement of his Inverness team is a more accurate reflection of Hughes's personality and ability than any number of interviews could provide. While Hughes was celebrating with his daughters, his counterpart Peter Houston wandered across the Hampden pitch lifting up any of his players who were sitting slumped on the turf. He gathered them all together at one stage, and spoke reassuring words, but the tearfully distraught faces of David McCracken and MacDonald told the story of Falkirk's game. McCracken had been commanding throughout, while MacDonald had dealt comfortably with anything he had been asked to do, yet they both made misjudgements that led to the winning goal. That was a cruel fate for two players who have contributed much to the progress of this Falkirk side during a long campaign. The same could be said of the team's best two players on the day, Peter Grant and Will Vaulks, but their individual displays, full of power, force, indefatigable spirit and energy were undone in the end. By switching to a front two at the interval, Falkirk had regained their competitiveness, attacking more freely and upsetting Inverness's poise so much that Hughes kept altering the shape of his side just to try to alter the flow of the game. Houston could only accept the outcome with equanimity. It wasn't to be Falkirk's day, and it seemed destined to always be Inverness's instead. That was the way of it at Hampden, when two teams, from two different divisions, delivered a competitive and compelling final. Hughes and his players revelled in the celebrations, while the Falkirk players regretted a moment, however brief, of misfortune.", "question": "A banner was draped over the front of the stand housing the Inverness fans at Hampden .

{"article": "The researchers said they had used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to \"undo\" nicotine addiction in the brain. The findings, presented at the Neuroscience 2013 conference, suggested the technique could help people cut down or quit completely. Further trials are needed before it could be recommended as a therapy. TMS stimulates neurons to alter brain function and is already used in some patients with depression. The team at Ben Gurion University in Israel targeted magnetic fields at two regions of the brain associated with addiction to nicotine - the prefrontal cortex and the insula cortex. The 115 regular smokers in the study were split into three groups and for 13 days they were given high-frequency TMS, low-frequency TMS or no treatment at all. Those getting high-frequency TMS had lower levels of smoking and were more likely to have quit at the end of the six-month study. The highest success came when participants were also shown pictures of a lit cigarette while having the magnetic therapy - a third had quit after six months. The researchers argue the therapy may be changing the brain's hardwired response to smoking \"cues\". Dr Abraham Zangen, from Ben Gurion University, said: \"Our research shows us that we may actually be able to undo some of the changes to the brain caused by chronic smoking. \"We know that many smokers want to quit or smoke less and this could help put a dent in the number one cause of preventable deaths.\" Dr Chris Chambers, who specialises in TMS at Cardiff University, told the BBC: \"This is a neat, well-controlled study. \"Its main contribution is to add to growing evidence that brain stimulation, when applied to specific parts of the frontal lobe, can boost our ability to overcome addictions. \"This is exciting and has a myriad of applications in psychiatry.\" However, he cautioned that the study had not yet been peer-reviewed and that \"we need to develop a much clearer understanding of why and how such methods work\". A separate study, reported at the same conference, suggested that stimulating the brain with implanted electrodes may help combat heroin addiction. Normally, rats given free access to the drug at the press of a lever will keep taking more and more of the drug as they become addicted. However, those having deep brain stimulation took less of the drug and did not show the escalating drug-use pattern. Commenting on both studies, Prof Barry Everitt, from the University of Cambridge, said: \"Non-drug interventions would be an enormous step forward in drug abuse treatment, which currently relies on replacing one drug with another and has an extremely high rate of relapse.\"", "question": "Using magnetic fields to alter brain @placeholder may help some people quit smoking , according to an early study .", "option_0": "rates", "option_1": "personnel", "option_2": "activity", "option_3": "sprouting", "option_4": "homes", "label": 2}

{"article": "Writing in the respected journal Economic Weekly, Roma Mehta said women in India were \"more protected and much better cared for than in the West\"; that they found \"more happiness more often than not in her home; and her troubles and heartaches were solved in family\" where she lived. \"The incompatibility may sometimes be very great indeed; but in spite of it all, the family is maintained.\" She argued that divorce did not \"concern the very vast majority of people\" in a country where the economy is fundamentally rural, people are uneducated with no contact with the outside world, and the \"clamour for better living is absent\". So, wrote Ms Mehta, the \"problems of love and hate, of marriage and remarriage, are solved on a simple plan which is worked out for the community only\". That was then. The landmark Hindu Code Bill passed in the parliament in the mid-1950s gave women property rights, outlawed polygamy and allowed partners to file for divorce. The laws were further tweaked in 1976 to allow divorce by mutual consent. Over time, the traditional joint family has given way to nuclear families in cities and towns; and more and more women are going to work or setting up their own businesses. Many urban women no longer have to depend on their spouses for financial security, men are sharing household chores; and gender equations are slowly changing. Now a significant study by economist Suraj Jacob and anthropologist Sreeparna Chattopadhyay has examined data from India's census to offer - possibly for the first time - some insights into divorce and separation in India. India's census gives its citizens the following choices to select their status: never married, separated, divorced, widowed, married. It is true that some women may not report separation or divorce because of the stigma attached to the status. But here are some of the more salient findings of the study: What does this tell us about breakdown of marriages in today's India? For one, more people are separated than divorced in India because of stigma associated with divorce, and the time taken in resolving disputes in the slow-moving Indian courts. The gender gap - more women divorced and separated - is even more striking, and tells a story about India's gender biases and how patriarchy operates. This essentially means that either women are choosing to stay divorced or are not finding partners for remarriage, unlike men. \"It is consistent with the bias that women face in India,\" says Ms Chattopadhyay. \"You have the right to divorce, but remarriage remains tough because of prejudices against a divorcee.\" Thirdly, the gap between divorces and separations in cities and towns and villages is \"very low\" - a finding that has come as a \"big surprise\" to the researchers. \"So class may or may not make a difference, but residence does not seem to make a huge difference,\" they say. Thirdly, divorce and separation rates vary wildly across states and regions. Divorce and separation rates in the north-eastern states - where tribal laws allow for informal relations and women sometimes enjoy a relatively higher status because of a matrilineal system - are relatively higher than elsewhere in India. Northern states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana and Rajasthan which are known to be deeply patriarchal, have much lower divorce and separation rates. An international study of divorce rates of 71 countries - one of the few studies showing global comparisons -  showed that they range from a low of 0.04% of the total population in Georgia to a high of 0.46% in Belarus. Interestingly, Gujarat's divorce rate is greater than of Belarus, and Bihar's closer to Georgia suggesting a \"striking level of regional diversity\". Also, say the researchers, the \"divorce rates in India are neither surprising nor unsurprising\". \"Although there is a lot of anecdotal evidence about 'skyrocketing' divorce rates in aggregate terms, we are not particularly high globally in terms of the rates of divorce,\" say Mr Jacob and Ms Chattopadhyay, who teach at Bangalore's Azim Premji University. \"India is somewhere in the middle. Also given that rates of living together before marriage are extremely low in India and marriage is universal, it wouldn't be surprising that for some members of the younger people, first marriages can end up in divorce.\" Nupur Dhingra Paiva, a Delhi-based clinical child psychologist, tells me that when she started out three years ago, she would barely get one case every two months of divorced parents bringing in their troubled children for counselling. \"Now I get one such case every week.

{"article": "The judgement prevents Microsoft from registering a trademark for Skype's name and bubble-design logo. The US company intends to appeal against the decision. Judges at the General Court of the European Union said: \"Conceptually, the figurative element conveys no concept, except perhaps that of a cloud.\" \"[That] would further increase the likelihood of the element 'Sky' being recognised within the word element 'Skype', for clouds are to be found 'in the sky' and thus may readily be associated with the word 'sky'.\" Microsoft had brought the case to challenge an earlier ruling by the European Union's Office for Harmonisation of Internal Markets, which, following a 2005 complaint by the broadcaster, also said Skype branding was too similar to Sky's to be granted an EU-wide trademark. This is not the first legal clash between the two companies. In 2014, Microsoft changed the name of its cloud storage service from SkyDrive to OneDrive after the High Court in London ruled Sky's trademark had been infringed. However, a spokeswoman for Microsoft said it was not now facing the prospect of another imminent rebrand. \"The case was not a legal challenge to Skype's use of the mark, it was only against the registration,\" she told BBC News. \"We're confident that no confusion exists between these brands and services and will appeal. This decision does not require us to alter product names in any way.\" Microsoft believes it still had the means to prevent anyone else from trying to call their product Skype. In theory, Sky could now try to pursue Microsoft for a licensing fee even if it did not want to block the use of Skype's name outright. However, the firm did not directly address this point in a statement released following the ruling. \"Sky notes today's decision from the General Court of the European Union,\" it said. \"This relates to a long-running dispute with Skype over the extension of its trademark applications to cover a broad range of goods and services that overlap with Sky's own trademark registrations - including, but not limited to, TV related products and services. \"Our intention has been to protect the Sky brand with our research showing that similarities in name and logo have the potential to confuse customers.\" Sky has acted in the past against another US company to protect its identity.

{"article": "The appearance of a single stag on the loose in the city on Thursday may be linked to the fact that the rutting season reaches its peak in the first two weeks of October. \"Young males are chased by older ones in the bid to mate with the females at this time of year,\" said USPCA spokesman David Wilson. \"The competition for females can get very aggressive and although you can only speculate, it may be that this stag was ostracised and got disoriented and lost.\" However, the Ulster Wildlife Trust's nature reserve manager, Andy Crory, said any number of factors could cause deer to wander onto roads or urban areas. \"They're sensitive creatures, so it could have been spooked by anything - a car, a dog, a person,\" said Mr Crory. \"In most forest parks, you'll find people walking dogs and unfortunately they often let them off leads, which unnerves the deer. When they're afraid, they can easily walk onto roads. \"Throughout the winter, you'll find them on roads more often as it's darker and they tend to come out at night, when they're more likely to avoid people. \"They don't like to be seen, so they hide, and if they get onto a road, they panic.\" This stag was filmed wandering along a country road in County Down last weekend - Saintfield woman Anita Black provided the footage. The USPCA advice, for those who come across deer outside their natural habitat, is to call the police and not to approach the animals. Private herds are maintained at Colebrooke Estate in County Fermanagh; Baronscourt Estate in County Tyrone; Shanes Castle Estate in County Antrim and the Clandeboye Estate in County Down. But for enthusiasts who wants to spot them in the wild, Tollymore Forest Park is a good place to start. Although the exact number is unknown, the deer population in the County Down beauty spot is believed to be about 150. Fallow - which are native to Europe - have been in the area since the 1970s. It is one of three deer species that inhabit Northern Ireland, the others being Red and Japanese Sika. Wild deer generally originate from the deer parks of large estates both past and present. Sika are generally confined to counties Fermanagh and Tyrone. The National Trust maintains a small enclosed herd of Fallow deer at Crom Castle in County Fermanagh, while Sika can be spotted in Gortin Glen Forest, County Tyrone, and Red deer roam Gosford Forest Park in County Armagh. The Forest Service carries out deer culls each year to keep the population from becoming too large. \"Woodlands need to regenerate and if the deer population got out of control, the woodland that provides for them and other animals would be destroyed,\" said Mr Crory. He added that wildlife enthusiasts should look for signs of deer if they want to spot them. \"Look for deer tracks or signs that they've been rubbing up against trees, and you need to be still - their senses are better than ours so if you're spotted first, they'll be gone.\"", "question": "Deer are not an uncommon sight in rural Northern Ireland , but in built up areas like Newry , County Down , they are a rare @placeholder indeed .", "option_0": "listed", "option_1": "growing", "option_2": "image", "option_3": "phenomenon", "option_4": "laboratory", "label": 2}
{"article": "It was John McDonnell's big day. The shadow chancellor stood at the House of Commons despatch box at 13.20 GMT to coruscate Philip Hammond over his Autumn Statement. Labour MPs were rapt as he did so. Some by his oratory; others, it seems, by the electronic devices in their hands. As the picture above shows, quite a few MPs, even some of his front bench colleagues, used their smartphones while he spoke. As the next picture shows, the activity was not confined to one side, Business Secretary Greg Clark looking at his while Mr Hammond answered questions. And even Mr McDonnell himself was distracted at one point by a mobile phone held by his shadow Treasury team colleague Jonathan Reynolds. Speaker John Bercow has previously warned MPs not to \"fiddle\" with their phones \"ostentatiously\" and suggested they go outside if they really can't resist the temptation. But is it right that this has to be spelt out in one of the world's premier debating chambers, where argument is supposed to be of paramount importance? Where Gladstone and Disraeli were supreme, where Churchill guided a nation through its most challenging times? Well, since 2007, Commons rules have stated that MPs can use mobiles \"to keep up to date with emails... provided that it causes no disturbance\". It sounds like a quaint provision today. Times have changed, as the Commons Procedure Committee notes: \"There are many new devices, including portable 'tablet' computers such as iPads or smartphones, which were not known to the Modernisation Committee which drew up the report which led to the House's resolution. \"There are also new uses of technology, for example Twitter, which were similarly unknown but on which the Speaker and the Chair of any committee may be expected to rule, using the existing resolution as a guideline.\" Conservative MP Nigel Mills issued an apology in 2014 for playing the mobile puzzle game Candy Crush Saga during a Commons committee hearing. Generally, though, tweeting from inside the chamber is seen as acceptable. Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told BBC 5 live: \"The world moves on. But it's not about being obvious, is it? It's about ensuring that you be discreet.\" If he thought an MP was tapping away and staring downwards a little too noticeably, he would give them \"a nudge\", rather than shout across the chamber, he said. Mr Hoyle added: \"People want to stay in touch with the outside world now. They want to tell them what's going on. It's about keeping the balance right.... \"Everything moves on, as we know, in this world. When people talk to each other through a device without even speaking, you've got to wonder where does society end up. I hope we don't lose the ability to talk to each other.\" Mr Hoyle also acknowledged that the guilty verdict following the trial of Thomas Mair for murdering Labour MP Jo Cox had come through about an hour before Mr McDonnell began speaking, meaning there was more focus on news sites and social media than usual. But the rules are stronger in some other countries, irrespective of circumstance. In Greece, electronic devices are banned from the plenary hall, while the Finnish chamber prohibits the use of laptops. In the US, Congress has a rule stating: \"A person on the floor of the House may not smoke or use a mobile electronic device that impairs decorum.\" Mr McDonnell, when asked about the Autumn Statement scenes, told Sky News: \"What they do now in the Commons, and I'm not sure how this goes down with the general public, is that a lot of them will be tweeting their comments out about what's being said and they'll be responding to tweets etc. \"It's changed the nature of the chamber itself... It's happening consistently now and you see it on all political parties too,\" If answering emails is distracting, social media is more so. The Commons authorities recognise this: \"As an example of a practice which could not have been predicted by the Modernisation Committee in 2007, tweeting could hardly be bettered.\" The procedure committee says it would be \"inconsistent\" to allow tweeting from the gallery overlooking the Commons but ban it from inside the chamber. But it urges MPs to \"use their good sense and behave with courtesy, particularly in not tweeting messages which would be disorderly if said in the House\".

{"article": "Now the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts in the negotiations. Could that be enough to save the agreement? The peace process with the Farc is on a roller coaster ride. Mr Santos spent four years in difficult negotiations before signing an agreement in August at a triumphant ceremony in Cartagena. But the public vote rejecting the accord left him with little to show - until he was made a Nobel laureate. \"I receive this award with great humility and as a mandate to continue to work tirelessly for the peace of Colombia,\" Mr Santos said after the announcement. \"For this, I will dedicate all my efforts for the rest of my days.\" But beyond the commitment of the president, how can the Nobel Prize unlock a crisis where the government is facing a \"no\" from its people? Overall, the award is seen as a boost to the process and a message from the international community to all parties to the conflict. \"It is the voice of the world supporting our country,\" said Humberto De la Calle, chief negotiator for the government in Havana, where the deal was struck. \"It is appropriate that we continue listening in a fast and efficient way to different sectors of society to understand their concerns and promptly define a way out.\" He said that many of the interpretations of the agreement from the \"no\" side were wrong. But, he said, there would be a dialogue between the government and the Farc that could lead to adjustments or clarifications of the deal. That was seconded by Ivan Marquez, the Farc's chief negotiator. \"We will see how can we attach (new items) to an agreement we have built with great effort and dedication for more than four years,\" he said. But he added: \"We have already signed something, we will not (the Farc and the government) will not destroy what we have built.\" Echoing the position of Mr Marquez was Diana Gomez, a representative for victims of state crimes. At an event for \"yes\" voters in the presidential palace on Friday, she said that the agreement reached must be respected. At the end of that event, President Santos said: \"Yes to peace, (yes to having the) agreement now\". There is an openness to dialogue with the \"no\" side, but also pressure to solve the issues as soon as possible, while changing the signed agreement as little as possible. Andrei Gomez Suarez, a professor at Universidad de Los Andes and member of the organisation Rodeemos el Dialogo (\"surround ourselves with dialogue\"), also thinks the Nobel Prize gives the president the power to persevere. \"Undoubtedly it changes the balance of power for President Santos, and gives him legitimacy,\" he told the BBC. The Centro Democratico political party, led by the former president and current senator Alvaro Uribe, are the main opponents of the deal with the Farc. They are already holding talks with the government, which will continue next week with proposals for amendments. But the Farc might find it very difficult - if not impossible -  to accept some of them. On hearing the news, Mr Uribe tweeted his congratulations to President Santos, but said he wanted to \"change harmful agreements for democracy\". Another major opposition figure, former President Andres Pastrana, tweeted: \"I congratulate @JuanManSantos for his Nobel Peace. Another reason to advance national unity agreement.\" That national agreement refers to a proposed consensus between the government and the \"no\" campaign which would be taken to the negotiating table in Havana. Mr Santos is also very unpopular among many in Colombia. The Nobel Peace Prize has not changed their opinions. These were the people that fuelled the \"no\" victory on Sunday. Throughout the peace process with the Farc, the international community has given strong support to the negotiations. Among them are Pope Francis, the United States, the European Union, United Nations, and the countries of Latin America. Sources: BBC Monitoring, Colombian presidency And yet, when the time came for a vote, outsiders could not influence the decision. \"What Colombians think has more weight than what the international community says,\" Centro Democratico Senator Paloma Valencia told the BBC. \"The international community doesn't live here and did not have to suffer what Colombians had to.\" But even with a Nobel Peace Prize, the hardcore \"no\" voters will not change their minds.

{"article": "Fake news is nothing new, depending on what you mean by it. But during the past year - specifically during Donald Trump's election - it has become a cancer in the body politic, growing from an isolated but malignant tumour into a raging, mortal threat. No hack can witness this without alarm. As a BBC journalist I am required to be politically impartial; but as my distinguished colleague Nick Robinson has argued, I am under no obligation to be impartial about democracy (as against tyranny, for example). Nor am I under any obligation to be impartial about truth, as against lies. The possibility of truth is a necessary condition for democracy. Fake news is an assault on truth. Therefore it behoves all right-thinking journalists to combat fake news. First of all, what is fake news? Fake news is of three kinds. First, false information deliberately circulated by those who have scant regard for the truth but hope to advance particular (often extreme) political causes and make money out of online traffic. Second, false information that is circulated by journalists who do not realise it is false. All unintended errors of fact in the history of journalism, from hoaxes to exaggerated headlines - Freddie Starr never ate a hamster - fall into this category. That is why I say fake news is nothing new: in fact it is as old as journalism, if not older. The point about this kind of fake news is it often contains at least a scintilla of truth. Third, news that causes Donald Trump discomfort. At his press conference last week, the president-elect targeted CNN, conflating that organisation with Buzzfeed. CNN says it had corroborated accusations about Mr Trump that it published; whereas Buzzfeed published a dossier that contained allegations that hadn't been corroborated. Mr Trump was discomfited by CNN; therefore he described it as fake news. The first kind of fake news - deliberate lies - has been energised by the viral power of social media. The Pope didn't back Mr Trump; nor did Denzel Washington. But millions may have believed one or both those propositions, and their originators got rich on the lie. The third kind of fake news isn't really fake at all. It's simply news that some people don't like to acknowledge, and wish to silence. But if you believe that the media should be free to scrutinise the use and abuse of power, and so hold power to account, the silencing of legitimate questions through the abusive epithet \"fake news\" is clearly anti-democratic. The first two kinds of fake news are, to varying degrees, hostile to the democratic process. A useful distinction would describe the second as false news rather than fake news. But with the third kind, it is the use of the term \"fake news\", rather than what it is describing, that is dangerous. The first kind spreads deceit and pollutes the well of civility on which strong societies must draw. The second - false news - damages trust in the media. In the third instance, use of the term \"fake news\" numbs scrutiny and also pollutes that well of civility. All proper journalists reside in the zone between truth and falsehood. Some try harder than others to resist the magnetic pull - and it can be very strong at times - of the latter. Most, if they have any self-worth, steer clear of the outright lies that make up that first kind of fake news. Many big media organisations recognise fake news is dangerous and are acting against it. Facebook, after initially expressing scepticism about the influence of fake news in the presidential election, has started taking it very seriously indeed. The BBC is boosting Reality Check, a fact-checking service that will work with Facebook. Several years ago Channel 4 News launched Fact Check, which fulfilled a similar role. These are all pleasing, practical measures. But there is a deeper philosophical issue at stake, concerning the role of truth in our society. No society can conduct the informed conversation necessary for civility, the resolution of disputes, or the judicious exercise of power and law if there is no agreement on basic facts. You cannot choose how to go forward if you cannot agree what just happened. Therefore it is necessary to agree that there are facts, or true propositions. In the West today, largely but not solely because of the advent of digital media, the truth is more vulnerable than it has been for a long time. This is partly because whereas falsity comes by degrees, truth is absolute; and therefore anything that chips away at its granite surface leaves a big dent. It is also because, as I wrote in the last editorial of the Independent newspaper (now solely online), the truth is hard, expensive and boring. Whereas lies are easy, cheap and thrilling. Finding out the real story takes time and effort. Time and effort cost money. Once you've found the real story, you have to verify it: that's what makes it true. But verification also takes time and effort. And sometimes, the thrilling tip-off you received turns out to be no more than that. It would be amazing if the Moon were made of cheese, or Elvis Presley still lived. But it isn't, and he doesn't. Fake news of the second kind - the sort of exaggerations and errors that are inevitable in journalism, and which I call false news - will always be with us. But fake news of the first kind has to be combated, and use of the term to silence scrutiny deserves the same harsh treatment. You cannot conduct either of these battles, however, unless you have the preliminary belief that truth is not only possible, but vital. And where might that come from?

{"article": "Alisdair Grant, 21, from Kilmarnock, crashed his brother's Fiat Punto into Gerry Lewis's Suzuki Jimny on the A719, near Waterside, on 2 March 2014. The 54-year-old, who was travelling with his wife Sarah, died at the scene. Grant admitted causing his death by dangerous driving. Sentence was deferred at the High Court in Glasgow. The court heard that at the time of the crash Grant was not long back on the road having been banned for a year in December 2012 for drink driving. Prosecutor Mark McGuire told the court: \"Text messages recovered from his mobile phone sent that day indicate he had been partying heavily the night before. \"Around two hours before the collision - in response to someone asking if he was fit to drive - he replied he thought he would be soon. \"The texts made it clear that Grant was tired.\" Mr Lewis had been travelling with his wife to see his widowed mother in Glasgow. The court was told that as the two vehicles approached, Grant's Fiat drifted \"without warning\" into the path of Mr Lewis's car. The advocate depute went on: \"From what Mrs Lewis could see, there was no attempt to break by Grant. He had fallen asleep at the wheel.\" The smash caused \"significant damage\" to both cars. Mrs Lewis looked at her husband and immediately saw he had been badly hurt. Mr McGuire continued: \"She shouted for help, pleading for people to assist her husband.\" Other drivers came to their aid before police and ambulance crews arrived. The couple were initially trapped in the car. Mr Lewis had to be cut free from the wreckage, but he never recovered. Mr Lewis, who had worked for North Lanarkshire Council for 20 years, died due to chest and abdominal injuries. The court heard his loss has been \"profound\" for Mrs Lewis.

{"article": "Actually, belay that. Holyrood's committees - rash, impetuous brutes that they are - have already begun the process of examining the underlying state of Scottish public spending, prior to looking at the details when they emerge. The delay, of course, was occasioned by the fact that the Treasury's Autumn Statement was, itself, somewhat late in the term. Apparently, the slackers justify this by the intervention of an apocalyptic referendum and a change in Prime Minister/Chancellor. Unaccountably, Scotland's Finance Secretary Derek Mackay was reluctant to guess what Scotland might be allocated in terms of the Westminster block grant. Hence the delay in the Scottish Budget. But we are there now. We get the Budget details tomorrow and this afternoon, as a toothsome prelude, there is a Holyrood debate on taxation. Not in generic terms. Not as an exercise in ideological discourse - although there may be a concomitant dose of that too. No, Holyrood now sets Scotland's rates and bands for tax on earned income. This means you. (If, of course, you live and work in Scotland.) For many decades, indeed centuries, there has been a debate, illuminating or otherwise, as to what constituted a Scot. Was it origin? Was it sporting affiliation? Was it choice? Now we have another delineation. Scottish - for tax purposes. There will be some, it is anticipated, who will decline such a status. Scottish government briefings talk coyly of \"behavioural effects\" from Holyrood tax decisions. By that, they mean some individuals might choose to become other than Scottish, for tax purposes, if the bill for higher rate taxpayers ends up higher than in England, as is intended by Scottish Ministers. But before that prospect arises - or doesn't - there is the small matter of getting the SG plans endorsed by parliament. Or, indeed, otherwise. Ministers are quite determined to get their budget through - and to do so without conceding on the fundamentals of their tax plans. However, the SNP is in a minority at Holyrood and needs another party to back them or abstain. Just one party. Why the resolute determination to adhere to the tax plans? Because they have been carefully calibrated. Because they formed a defining element in the Holyrood elections. And because the SNP won by far the most seats in that election. Big parties have rights too. But, mostly, it is that careful calculation. To recap, Derek Mackay intends no change to the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax. But he will not replicate what he regards as an unwarranted cut in the tax bill of higher earners. The Chancellor has announced that, from 2017, the threshold for the 40p higher rate will be increased to Â£45,000 - en route to an eventual Â£50,000 figure. By contrast, Mr Mackay says that, from 2017, the Scottish threshold for 40p tax should only rise by CPI inflation. After that, the CPI increase will be the maximum. It may be less. To be clear, you won't pay more tax here in Scotland than you do at the moment. Indeed, your bill may well go down because bands are changing, including a UK-wide increase in the basic starting point for income tax. But, if you're one of the 356,000 people in Scotland who pay tax at the 40 pence higher rate, then you'll pay around three hundred pounds a year more - than you would in England. That is the basis of the Conservative complaint in the debate they have instigated for this afternoon. They say it is fundamentally wrong that folk in Scotland should pay more than in England. They say, further, that it leaves Scotland potentially uncompetitive: that Scottish employers might have to pay higher salaries to compensate. Mr Mackay disagrees - vehemently. He says the tax plans have been designed to achieve balance. Indeed, the SNP drew considerable flak from the other side of politics for declining to increase income tax to protect spending. The Minister argues, further, that the Tories are \"showing their true colours\". He says that they are inherently opposed to the wielding of devolved tax powers. The Tories dissent. As I have noted here previously, it will be difficult to secure a budget deal in the current atmosphere at Holyrood - where opposition parties are feeling decidedly oppositional and the governing party is keen to preserve as much of its programme as feasible. 372,000 Approximate total number 10% Working population Â£190m Value of 40p tax cut plan 14,000 Workers removed if cut adopted in Scotland Tories? Think not. This afternoon is designed to highlight their profound opposition to a core element of the budget, tax. Labour? Ditto. Expect them to demand increased taxation this afternoon, echoing their mantra from the election. Both the Greens and the Liberal Democrats have proposals on taxation which depart substantially from the SG plans. But it may be - it may be - that they could be attracted by spending offers in line with certain of their core pledges. However, right now, with the tax debate and the Budget pending, there is no deal. Plenty of talks but little overt movement. That is because the governing and opposition parties know they do not need to move, seriously, until spring next year. Which leaves the atmosphere a little febrile. There is even talk in SNP circles of identifying the rival party \"which fears an early election the most\". There is talk of identifying, precisely, what it would mean if Parliament declines to carry the tax resolution which is scheduled for one week before the Stage Three vote on the Budget Bill, again in the spring. With the passage of time and the expenditure of effort, I expect there will be a deal - with one or another party agreeing, reluctantly, to abstain in return for a key concession.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device The Scottish brothers beat Steve Darcis and David Goffin 6-4 4-6 6-3 6-2 to put the visitors 2-1 up in Ghent. Britain require one win from Sunday's reverse singles matches to secure their first Davis Cup victory since 1936. Andy Murray will play Goffin, with Kyle Edmund scheduled to face Ruben Bemelmans in the final match. Captains can change their nominations up until one hour before the 12:00 GMT start on Sunday, and Britain's Leon Smith could bring in James Ward for Edmund if it comes down to a fifth rubber. Andy Murray: \"I will prepare like any other match for tomorrow. Goffin is a world-class player and with the crowd behind him it will be a difficult match. We have two chances to try and win it tomorrow and if you had offered us that at the start we would have taken it.\" Jamie Murray: \"There was so much noise, it was mental. We were shouting to each other at times but it's brilliant, and it's what you expect with so many passionate fans here for the final.\" Leon Smith: \"There was a lot of stress and tension. Picking Goffin didn't surprise us and we knew it would be a dogfight but our boys played better throughout and produced an excellent performance yet again.\" Belgian captain Johan van Herck: \"It's a difficult day tomorrow. But as a team we have to believe, we have to stand up, we have to fight.\" Andy Murray punched the air while his brother exhaled in relief after the brothers won a tense encounter, and made it nine points in a row for the Murray family in this year's Davis Cup. Van Herck had sprung something of a surprise by bringing in Goffin, a player with little doubles experience, and leaving out Davis Cup regular Bemelmans. \"We decided this morning after the warm-up,\" said the captain. \"My first plan was always to play David and Steve, but I wanted to see how David got out of his [singles] match. \"It was not for us the best tactic to go and play at the net and play real doubles, because I think the British were better. So we wanted to play from the back and make them play a lot of points. \"For sure, during the first three sets, we showed why it was the right tactic to do.\" After two tight opening sets were shared it appeared as though the Belgian captain might have pulled off a masterstroke with his selection when a flashing Darcis return put the hosts a break up in the third. The majority of the very loud 13,000 spectators shook the Flanders Expo to its foundations, but their joy was short-lived. Jamie, the elder brother by a year at 29, had excelled in previous rounds against France and Australia but he struggled for the first hour and a half on Saturday. His serve was especially vulnerable, but he pounced at the net to level at 2-2 and the contest shifted decisively in Britain's favour. There were five breaks in six games but the rock-solid presence on court was Andy Murray, who held throughout and served out the third set emphatically. By now the weak link was Darcis, who was unable to hold serve in the third and fourth sets and double-faulted in giving up the key break early in the fourth. Jamie Murray then survived a gripping service game of seven break points and, after Darcis was broken once again, it left the elder brother to serve out what could prove the decisive win of the weekend. \"I rushed a few shots that normally I wouldn't have done,\" said Jamie Murray. \"Maybe that was the whole situation of the tie. \"Also I haven't played for five, six months on clay - it is different. But we made the adjustments and we finished the match really strong, I think.\" Edmund and Ward were out on court practising soon after the end of the doubles, but the watching handful of remaining British fans will hope they are not required. Andy Murray has won both previous matches against Goffin and conceded just one game in Paris earlier this month. \"Tomorrow I have nothing to lose,\" said the Belgian rather unconvincingly. Should Goffin pull off a huge upset and force a fifth rubber, it could be any combination of the remaining team members that take to court for the biggest match of their lives. \"You could argue it will not decide the tie, but it's a good position to be in, winning the doubles,\" said GB captain Smith. \"They did very, very well today. But I would rather be having two shots tomorrow rather than one. \"We go away and make sure that Andy and whoever goes out for the second singles is absolutely ready.\"", "question": "Great Britain are one win from a first Davis Cup @placeholder in 79 years following Andy and Jamie Murray 's doubles victory against Belgium .", "option_0": "competition", "option_1": "stoppage", "option_2": "title", "option_3": "display", "option_4": "hoodoo", "label": 2}

Mr Iqbal, 33, of Smethwick, was found strangled on 2 February. Bibi plotted revenge after being rejected by Mr Iqbal and his remains were found crammed into a cardboard box in his car, the jury was told during the six-week trial.

Judge Mark Wall said Bibi must serve a minimum 27-year sentence and told her: \"Your selfishness and manipulative behaviour are truly breathtaking.\" Gul Nawaz, of Roway Lane, Oldbury, must serve a minimum term of 25 years. The judge lifted a reporting restriction to name their 16-year-old son Kashim Nawaz as the third person convicted of Mr Iqbal's murder. He told Bibi: \"You were the one person pushing your own son to commit murder.\" Mr Iqbal and Bibi had an \"unconventional and complicated relationship\" which their spouses were \"fully aware\" of, the court had heard. However, in August last year Mr Iqbal banned the pair from any contact and was angry after discovering in January that they had continued to talk in secret. QC Sally Howes said: \"It is clear that in the period leading up to January 31, Zatoon Bibi is stirring up trouble between Mr Iqbal and his wife.\" Mr Iqbal ended the affair but was killed after Bibi lured him to her home on 31 January claiming she wanted to give him some birthday cake.

{"article": "In the searing Florida heat I counted at least 20 television satellite trucks (yes, including one used by the BBC); plus assorted technicians, camera crews and glistening correspondents (including me). On the main road, a small group of banner-waving protesters denounced the pastor's views on everything from Islam to abortion to homosexuality. Inside, hardier members of Mr Jones' tiny flock strode around, with pistols hanging from high-waisted trousers. The man himself was big of voice and moustache, but strikingly short on clarity of message - not to mention understanding of the Muslim religion which he considers the \"devil's work.\" We did, however, get a fuller understanding of Terry Jones' wardrobe. His increasingly frequent news conferences took place against various hues of shirt and tie. On Thursday, Pastor Jones appeared to have completely changed clothes between two press conferences, barely an hour apart. And then there were the self-styled peacemakers. First, the local imam who brought the offer of a quid pro quo, in which the Korans would be reprieved in return for the relocation of a proposed Islamic centre near Ground Zero. A \"deal\" which rapidly unravelled, when it became clear that Imam Muhammad Musri had no authority to offer it. Hopelessly befuddled, Pastor Jones appeared not to know his imams from his Iman - at one stage suggesting he had struck a deal with David Bowie's wife. Next up to the plate was Dr KA Paul, a Christian evangelist who previously defended the honour of Charles Taylor, the former Liberian leader currently on trial for crimes against humanity. With no deficiency in self-assurance, Dr Paul issued an ultimatum to the Manhattan site developers - giving them two hours to formalise a meeting with Terry Jones. The \"or else\" was never made clear; and predictably, there was no outreach from New York. As the sun finally eased, I took a walk around the site of the corrugated-iron church, which bears a striking resemblance to an exhaust factory just up the road. To one side was a children's climbing frame and paddling pool, and a basketball hoop under trees draped with Spanish moss. At the foot of the Church's locked, mirrored doors lay three dozen red roses, under a notice stating \"expect a miracle.\" When I wandered towards an out-building, a wispy-moustached youth barred my way, explaining that this was a \"work area.\" Stacks of carefully-wrapped chairs and tables behind him seemed consistent with reports of Pastor Jones' sideline furniture business. Carpentry may be the only thing he has in common with Jesus. With the threat of lighted match meeting holy book apparently receding, the Gainesville constabulary seemed to relax, and by day's-end there were no uniformed police officers on view. On Northwest 37th Street a lone protestor paraded a simple banner proclaiming \"Shame on you\" - drawing supportive toots from passing motorists. \"Pastor Jones just wanted 15 minutes of celebrity whoredom,\" explained the protestor, aptly named Paula Pope. \"He's a short-sighted, idiotic, fanatical narcissist.\" Her remarks left me uneasy. Could this have been avoided, had we in the media denied the narcissistic Jones the mirror of publicity? Possibly - although I would argue it was the warnings from generals and politicians which transformed the Dove Outreach Center from obscurity into headline news. Warnings which the Obama administration clearly felt had to be made. As I write, the battalion of satellite trucks is thinning, and Gainesville is turning its thoughts to this campus town's true religion - college football - ahead of a fiercely-anticipated local derby.

Wonderful for the SNP, killer for Scottish Labour. \"A fear that is deeply implanted now in every Labour person like me is do not appear on a platform with Tories unless you absolutely have to.\" He also had plenty to say on the danger of the referendum campaign appearing to many traditional Labour supporters as a series of internal problems for the Conservative party, or as he put it in reference to the David Cameron versus Boris Johnson dynamic: \"This is not about civil war on the playgrounds of Eton.\" There is a sense that Labour voters are not appearing as engaged in the campaign as Conservative supporters, a feeling heightened by the dominance of Tories in most of the headlines. There are clear fears within Labour that this is a danger. Jeremy Corbyn, who has been lukewarm about the EU, will be putting the case to stay in at a rally in Cardiff on Friday. In the meantime, remain campaigners are continuing to warn of the potential economic dangers of a Brexit. The latest is a warning from the Centre for Economic and Business Research, commissioned by Britain Stronger in Europe, saying that the potential creation of 6,000 jobs over the next 14 years could be at risk. Just to be clear, this isn't saying 6,000 jobs would be lost, but instead it's saying that the 6,000 jobs that may be created in the future in the single market would be in doubt. The problem is that it's saying that jobs could be lost before they are even created. And it's that point which leave campaigners have latched on to, describing the figures as absurd. There has been a barrage of economic warnings about a Brexit but relatively few with specific Wales figures. That could begin to change. I understand that next week leave campaigners will give their projections on the population rise in Wales as a result of EU migration, and the corresponding rise in pressure on the NHS.

{"article": "The two sides began formal peace talks in November 2012 in the Cuban capital, Havana. Since then, they have reached agreement on four key topics and have set themselves a deadline of 23 March 2016 to sign a final document. According to a report by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory (in Spanish), more than 220,000 people have been killed in the armed conflict - 80% of them civilians. More than seven million people have registered with the government's Victim's Unit. The vast majority have been internally displaced by the violence, but many have also been kidnapped, threatened, injured by landmines or forcibly disappeared. However, not all of the violence is caused by Farc insurgents. The National Centre for Historical Memory found that more than half of the massacres in the past three decades had been carried out by right-wing paramilitaries, originally created to combat the Farc. Criminal gangs vying for control of Colombia's lucrative cocaine production have also become an increasing threat. The hope is that a permanent settlement with the Farc will allow the security forces to concentrate on combating that threat and protecting the civilian population rather than fighting a protracted battle with Farc rebels. Agreement has been reached on four broad points, but under the terms of the negotiations, they will not be acted upon until a final peace deal has been signed. They are: The teams are still working on many details but their leaders have set a deadline of 23 March 2016 for a final document to be signed. A final deal will be put to the people of Colombia in a referendum. While many Colombians have welcomed the progress made, there are also those who doubt that the rebels' motives are genuine. Some victims have also been critical of the fact that the guerrilla leaders are unlikely to go to jail. Under the deal on transitional justice reached in September, only those who refuse to own up to crimes committed will be sent to ordinary prisons while the others will undergo \"alternative forms\" of punishment. There are powerful voices in Colombia questioning the peace process and criticising the government's \"willingness to make concessions\" to the rebels. The most vocal critic is former president Alvaro Uribe, who argues the rebels are \"getting away with murder\", referring to the amnesty offer for rebels willing to confess their crimes. Re-integrating thousands of rebels will also be costly. The re-integration process takes years, with former combatants offered psychological help and vocational training, Other key points agreed at the talks will also not come cheap, such as land reform and replacing illegal crops with legal ones. All of these changes are unlikely to happen unless the Colombian people in general decide to back them. It is they who have to vote for the final peace agreement in a referendum and they who ultimately have to drive the reforms agreed in the deal.", "question": "The Colombian government and the country 's largest left - wing rebel @placeholder , the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) , are trying to end more than five decades of armed conflict .", "option_0": "district", "option_1": "network", "option_2": "groups", "option_3": "group", "option_4": "affiliate", "label": 3}

{"article": "But he never met the Welsh funeral directors doing their best to make people laugh, smile and feel comfortable at the send off of their loved ones. They have helped mourners with comedy music and scattered ashes using fireworks. BBC Wales spoke to some of those gently ushering tradition into the 21st Century, while maintaining the sanctity of a time-honoured profession. Gemma O'Driscoll, of GE O'Driscoll and Daughters, in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, has helped to arrange a funeral for a comedy-lover who had insisted no-one wear black and the Benny Hill TV programme theme be played. \"If the family want me to wear a onesie, I wear a onesie - if the family want me head-to-toe in pink, I'll wear pink,\" she said. \"To see a room full of people smiling and laughing during the funeral service is really something quite different,\" she said. \"There's definitely a change toward more of this kind of thing and I think we'll see much greater change going forward.\" There are 500 funerals in Wales every week. And third generation funeral director Gareth Jenkins, of the Baglan Funeral Home, in Neath Port Talbot, has overseen thousands of ceremonies, averaging up to 10 a week. \"When I first started it was very traditional - church, maybe, or chapel, whereas now it's more a celebration of life,\" he said. Unconventional ceremonies in Wales have seen an organic wool cocoon used instead of a coffin, motorbikes and HGVs replacing hearses and ashes compressed into diamonds and crystals. \"It's so important that the last memory they [mourners] have of somebody is a pleasant one and any little thing that we can do to make that special, we have to do,\" Mr Jenkins added. His wife, Christine, has become an expert at making the dead look their best, curling their hair, colouring their lips and ensuring they are dressed in their own clothes and glasses, if requested. A magician's wand was ceremonially broken and placed in the coffin at one funeral service in Newport. Ashes were also shot into the air using a firework display in Swansea while another service took place where no-one attended - as the deceased wished. The unlikely episodes are all featured in BBC One Wales' A Very Welsh Undertaking, a four-part programme exploring the work of those for whom death is a way of life. James Tovey, of Tovey Brothers, in Newport, arranged a farmer's funeral with his coffin taken past his land on a tractor trailer, led by a cortege of vintage agricultural vehicles. \"I hope he'd be very pleased if he were looking down on us,\" he said. Former champion power-lifter Helen Williams, who lives in the borders of Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, now organises non-religious ceremonies as a funeral celebrant. Ms Williams, who once squatted a then-record 200kg (31.5 stone), said: \"The power-lifting has prepared me for this in a strange way. You're carrying the weight of responsibility.\" She said reflecting on the person who has died is \"core\" to non religious funerals, which are becoming more popular. \"Every part of the ceremony is related to that person,\" she added. Latin phrase, media vita in morte sumus - in the midst of life, we are in death - is often used to evoke the fleeting nature of human mortality. But the opposite is also true, with death sometimes acting as a catalyst in life for those in the trade. It certainly provided a fateful introduction for Ceredigion funeral director, Maldwyn Lewis, when he met his now-wife, the Reverend Carys Ann.

{"article": "Charlotte Bevan, who had schizophrenia, walked out of St Michael's Hospital in Bristol in December 2014 with daughter Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck. Their bodies were found in undergrowth in the Avon Gorge days later. The serious case review also found the lack of a lead clinician overseeing Ms Bevan's care led to confusion. The Bristol Safeguarding Children Board's report said there was a system for controlling entry to the ward \"but mothers and babies were allowed free access throughout the hospital\". It went on to say that, \"this allowed CB [Charlotte Bevan] to leave the ward with ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] unnoticed and unchallenged\". The report said once the alarm was raised that Ms Bevan and her four-day-old daughter were missing, there was a quick response. However, it said the safeguarding concerns were \"everybody's business\" as Ms Bevan was \"able to walk outside at night, in unsuitable clothing, carrying a newborn baby, in a public place unchallenged by anyone\". Since their deaths, the report said ward security had been \"reviewed and improved\" and changes had been made to the reception area. Charlotte's mother Rachel Fortune, who contributed to the review, said in a written statement \"no single thing, action or person was to blame\". In the statement, released jointly with her daughter Janet, she said there were eight main findings which offered \"clear, constructive learning\", including how to manage long-term mental health in pregnancy, \"honest, accurate and timely communication\" and how several agencies could work together with a lead clinician. She added: \"This was a particularly difficult case to manage as long-term ill mental health and pregnancy came together. It's our hope now that any families and individuals facing such difficulties will have a multi-agency team with accountable clinicians in each service, as they now do in Bristol.\" The review also found Ms Bevan's explanation for stopping her medication due to breastfeeding concerns was not followed up with a pharmacist until after she had given birth. She later revealed she had not been taking medication for the last five months of her pregnancy, which the review team speculated was a sign of \"disguised compliance\". The report said: \"It is notable that it was not until CB [Charlotte Bevan] had given birth to ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] that any professional contacted a pharmacist to confirm the safety of her medication on ZBM when breastfeeding or otherwise.\" There was also confusion over who was leading, co-ordinating and overseeing Charlotte's overall care, the report found. In some cases, it found, health professionals assumed it was the Mother and Baby Unit Doctor, the mental health care co-ordinator or her GP. The report also found there was confusion over the terminology in describing her mental health condition. It found that describing her as \"well\" meant there was no clarity in what this meant in mental health terms.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Except sometimes we learn nothing. Sometimes what we see is exactly what we would expect to see, because it's exactly the same as the last time, and the time before that. So it was with Scotland v England at Murrayfield on Saturday evening. For all the talk of an Eddie Jones revolution, this was the old guard and the old order. For all the talk of a Scottish rebirth, this was the same character struggling in the same fashion. Five things we have learned? Maybe another time. Welcome to Five Things We Already Knew. This match was in the balance until five minutes into the second half, when England sent on Courtney Lawes for Joe Launchbury and, shortly afterwards, Mako Vunipola for Joe Marler. Energy, power and drive, and from that, momentum and then control. When Ben Youngs came on shortly afterwards, England pulled away a little more again. Jones, after just seven training sessions with his new team, handled the replacements well, not only in bringing those men on but in resisting the temptation to change his hooker until the very end and his tight-head Dan Cole at all. But England always have enjoyed this advantage in this fixture. You'd expect them to. The RFU has four times the turnover of the SRU, 12 professional teams to choose from rather than two, 166,000 regular male players to 15,000. Strength in depth has not been the problem. Truly world-class starters have been, as last autumn's World Cup once again illustrated. Since the start of the Six Nations 16 years ago, Scotland have scored two tries against England at Murrayfield. That's not an average of two, but the grand total. The last one came back in 2004. So to see them go tryless on Saturday, despite plenty of promising possession and territory, was as surprising as seeing men in kilts walking into Edinburgh boozers. Once again Scotland failed to capitalise on their opportunities - five clean breaks, several half-chances, several more errors or wrong decisions when the English line called. The stats keep coming. Seven straight defeats against England. Only one win in their last 13 Six Nations matches. Only one victory in their previous 16 opening games in a Six Nations tournament. Nothing new. Nothing to surprise. Lots to work on. Many of England's failings at the World Cup they hosted, for all the focus on Sam Burgess and penalties kicked to corners and stodgy selections, came from a scrum that was too often going in the wrong direction. Not on Saturday, however. The best English teams have always been indomitable up front: aggressive, gnarly, staying strong as the game goes long. Eddie Jones, a former hooker, recognises this and will be pleased that his front row at Murrayfield looked more old-school than schooled. That's the good news. The bad is that he still needs to uncover a proper back-row combination for the breakdown. In a first half where England scored first, they were frequently held back by slow ball and penalised for their labours when Scotland were in possession. Neither Chris Robshaw nor James Haskell won a single turnover; Haskell, at open-side, made a commendable 16 tackles, looking even more the classic blind-side than a jackal in disguise. The best teams at the World Cup had not one but two scavengers. England are still searching for one. Seldom has a man of the match award been more straightforward. After a World Cup in which he too often received the ball standing still, the 23-year-old showed how a man of 6ft 2in who weighs almost 20 stone should be used. Even when England were slow, the younger Vunipola was dynamic: 19 carries, five men beaten, 51 metres made. Which is exactly what Vunipola has always been capable of. And who would want to reinvent the wrecking-ball? When all four semi-final places at the World Cup were taken by southern hemisphere sides, the gnashings of teeth about the failings of the north were at least partially alleviated by the quality of the rugby on display. Sure, the dry, warm weather may have helped. But in the performances of those nations, and in particular the last two standing, New Zealand and Australia, came the perfect definition of perfection: producing nerveless rugby when nerves should be shot to pieces. England decelerated into that tournament and by the end were falling apart. On Saturday they instead grew stronger as the contest developed, but the mistakes were still there, just as they were for Scotland. During one period in a frenetic first half, error from one side followed error by the other and led to another from both. It was entertaining and it was breathless, but underlined why only one team from the Six Nations has ever won a World Cup: excitement is one thing, quality is often another.", "question": "A familiar post -match article in this digital @placeholder is the ' Five things we have learned ' formula .

A Richer World 2015 Listen to the reports and documentaries Trachtenberg invested in fancy dormitories, upmarket sports facilities and state-of-the-art classrooms in a deliberate strategy to make the school more appealing. It worked: the more he spent, the more fees rose and the more students wanted to go there. He has no regrets about the massive inflation in tuition costs because it all leads to better jobs. If a student can find work after graduation, \"then presumably the university,\" he says, \"has served the purpose they wanted, society wanted, and if they can pay the debt back, it's not a problem.\" But if you don't come from a wealthy family, those debts can be enormous. The high cost of fees creates a clear division between haves and have-nots among the student body - indeed in the country as a whole. I sat down for coffee at a local spot with three GW students. Each is working at least one part-time job to pay their college bills, and each is taking on some level of debt.

Shanil Jiwani currently has $60,000 in loans and he expects that number to double by the time he graduates - he'll be $120,000 in debt before he steps out into the world. Silvia Zenteno's university days are almost over. But even with the maximum amount of financial aid from the university, she still works 30 hours a week, and plans to graduate with $40,000 in loans. So why do it? Why put all that time, money and effort in? Maybe students here don't have much choice. \"When you're talking about your career and how much money you're going to make, your college investment is basically your down payment,\" Anthony Carnevale told me. He's the director of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce. And because Americans don't have a social safety net to fall back on, like many European countries, Carnevale says, US degrees are \"more valuable than degrees in other countries.\" So you pay a lot of money to get a degree from a good school, to get a good job, to pay back the loans of going to a good school. It's a vicious cycle of inflation that shows no signs of stopping. GW has just published its tuition fees for the upcoming school year: $50,367, up 3.4% from last year. What might just put a cap on the rising costs is that wonderfully egalitarian institution - the internet. More US universities are offering online courses virtually for free. You don't get the swanky campus facilities and face-to-face interaction, but you do get a good education. And if costs keep rising at the speed they have been, at some point more American students will say that looks like a pretty good deal.

He submitted two fake invoices to the school's education finance officer to gain £3,300 but was cleared of fraud. The 39-year-old was ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and a 10-day rehabilitation activity. De Silva took out two legitimate loans of cash totalling £3,300 in 2013 from a school account that included charity payments and money paid by parents for school trips, Bournemouth Crown Court heard. Victoria Hill, defending, said the \"hardship loan\" was agreed by the chair of governors at the school. But the court heard \"repeat attempts\" were made to retrieve the cash from De Silva until 2016 when he announced he would be leaving the school for a new job. He then submitted two fake invoices totalling £3,300 for supposed computer work carried out on behalf of the school in 2013 by an IT company that did not exist until 2015. De Silva, of Organford Road, Holton Heath, Poole, left the school earlier this year and the cash owed was repaid. Sentencing, Judge Recorder Donald Tait said De Silva had \"fallen a long way\", but added: \"No child suffered as a result of your stupidity.\" At the time of the offence De Silva had marriage problems and was going through \"a lot of stresses and strains\", Ms Hill said.

{"article": "The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said Damascus hoped to ship its most dangerous chemicals abroad by the end of April. About a third of them will have been removed by the end of this week. Despite the delays, the head of the joint OPCW-UN mission insisted that there had been \"good progress\". Dutch diplomat Sigrid Kaag said the end of June deadline for the total destruction or removal of Syria's chemical arsenal was still achievable. Elsewhere, government forces backed by fighters from the Lebanese Shia Islamist movement Hezbollah reportedly stepped up their bombardment of Yabroud, the last rebel stronghold in the Qalamoun mountains. Six more consignments of chemicals will leave Syria's Mediterranean port of Latakia by the end of the week, the OPCW said, as part of a US- and Russian-brokered deal agreed last year after a deadly chemical attack outside Damascus. A quantity of the blister agent sulphur mustard was shipped on Wednesday, it said. A significant consignment of other \"Priority 1\" chemicals was scheduled to arrive in Latakia this week, it added. The six consignments represent more than 35% of all chemicals that must be removed from Syria for destruction, including 23% of Priority 1 chemicals and 63% of less hazardous Priority 2 chemicals. The removal of Priority 1 chemicals was due by 31 December, while the deadline for the shipment of Priority 2 material was 5 February. The OPCW has also verified that Syria destroyed more than 93% of its stock of isopropanol, a dual-use chemical that is one of two key ingredients for sarin, a nerve agent used in the attack on several suburbs of Damascus on 21 August that left hundreds dead. The international watchdog's director general said all materials and equipment required by Syria were now in place for the \"expeditious removal\" of its remaining chemicals, including armoured jackets for the protection of containers. \"Given delays since the lapse of the two target dates for removal, it will be important to maintain this newly created momentum,\" Ahmet Uzumcu said. Ms Kaag, the special co-ordinator for the OPCW-UN joint mission, said: \"This is good progress and I expect further acceleration and intensification of effort.\" In a separate interview with the Associated Press, Ms Kaag said she had agreed with the Syrian government a 60-day timetable for shipments and anticipated \"a lot of action\" in March. Fighting in and around Yabroud, about 60km (37 miles) north of Damascus, left dozens of people dead on Monday, including some 17 rebels and 19 soldiers, pro-government militiamen and Hezbollah fighters, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Thousands have fled the Yabroud area and crossed into northern Lebanon since the government air strikes began last month. An army officer told journalists during a tour of government-held areas around Yabroud that civilians were still leaving, meaning the fighting was still light. He declined to say when a ground assault might begin. The government launched an offensive in mid-November to oust rebel fighters from the Qalamoun mountains, cut off their cross-border supply routes and establish firm control over the motorway linking Damascus with the city of Homs. In the capital, activists reported fresh fighting on the edge of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, with military helicopters dropping barrel bombs.

{"article": "They show 90 people who left care in England between 2012 and 2016 died in the years when they would have turned 19, 20 or 21. Care leavers make up 1% of the population at these ages, but make up around 7% of the deaths. The government says it is investing Â£10m in support for those leaving care. While an exact comparison is difficult, the official figures, showing people who left care between 2012 and 2016, indicate they are roughly seven times more likely to die when they are aged from 18 to 21 than other young people of a similar age. An inability to access physical and mental healthcare has been cited by care leavers as key contributory factors. One young man described being \"palmed off with pills\" when he tried to get mental health support. Colin Raggett, 27, explained how, after leaving care, he became reliant on drugs. \"After care I was all alone, I was in a lot of debt, and I was constantly going out trying to make money, committing crimes to fund my drug habit.\" He made several suicide attempts and during his last attempt, it was a chance intervention that saved his life. \"It came to the stage when I was stood on a train track one day. And I was spotted by my mental health worker, who completely by chance was also at the station, waiting to get on another train.\" His mental health worker raised the alarm to save him. \"The police were there, the fire brigade, ambulances, they closed the line off... It was the road to nowhere. And they were like 'He's got to go in for some psychiatric care.'\" When Colin had reached out for help in the past, he felt it was not forthcoming. \"They were putting me on one drug to try and get me off the drugs I was already on. They tried to put me on Ritalin, and I then got addicted to that. \"I felt they were just trying to palm me off. They just said you will be fine. Just take this pill, just take that pill.\" It was the lack of a holistic approach to care leavers that posed the biggest problem for Colin. He resolved this by making contact with The Prince's Trust, a charity that works with vulnerable young people. These figures from the Department for Education could be an underestimate - as investigations into untimely deaths might not identify that someone was formerly in social care. \"Coroners will not be provided with the care status of a young person whose untimely death they are investigating,\" says Alice Frank, manager of the National Leaving Care Benchmarking Forum at social enterprise Catch 22. \"Those care leavers who die while out of contact with their councils will not be reported to those councils, and the young person's care status will not be recorded in their death certificate.\" Around 500 care leavers are recorded as refusing contact with their local authorities, according to Department for Education statistics. One care worker, speaking anonymously, explained what this meant in practice. \"We had dealt with the case of one young man, who despite having a history of depression, seemed to be on track at the age of 21. \"As was correct, his case was closed, and we ceased contact with him. However, unfortunately, his life went downhill after that. \"He turned to drink and drugs, and did not receive proper mental health care. He committed suicide at the age of 23. \"We found out that he had died, by complete chance. We recognised his picture in the local paper when it ran a story announcing his death. It was quite a shock.\" Keeping a routine after years of disruption can be difficult for care leavers. An inability to manage their own affairs often leaves these young people vulnerable. Another young man who had a fortunate escape was Daniel Lee-Grabowski. Daniel, now 24 and a student at the University of the Arts London, found it difficult to stay healthy and organised after leaving the care of Surrey Council. \"Reality hits you quite harshly when you turn 18. You are not really prepared to move out into the real world in the right way. \"When I moved out into my own flat, I was left with bills and I didn't know basic things like that you had to pay to watch television. I couldn't even use a washing machine. \"These are things you just don't get told. If you have a family they would be able to show you what compartment to put the powder in. But I didn't have any of that.\" Daniel was kept on on track by an apprenticeship with Surrey Council, which he says gave him a purpose, an income and the support of his colleagues. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: \"We are committed to improving the lives of care leavers and giving them the support they need as they make their way into adulthood. \"That's why we are investing nearly Â£10m over the next four years in improving mental health support for looked-after young people in secure children's homes, and are changing the law so local authorities have to promote the physical and mental health of children in care.\" Councillor Richard Watts, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said: \"It is disappointing that this report treats care leavers as a homogenous group, taking no account of factors such as their individual life experiences, their age at coming into care or the amount of support that councils were able to provide. \"Research shows that the stability provided by carers can help children to achieve consistently better results at school when compared to children living with their families while receiving social work support, particularly when that care started early.\"", "question": "Young people who have grown up in care are far more likely to die in early adulthood than other young people , @placeholder of Information figures reveal .", "option_0": "according", "option_1": "Freedom", "option_2": "suggests", "option_3": "writes", "option_4": "plenty", "label": 1}

James has been a Swansea City regular since discovering football through the 1990 World Cup and, after following them home and away over years of failed qualifying campaigns, is also eagerly anticipating watching Wales at Euro 2016 this summer. \"My dad was such an insane rugby man that football was not much part of my life until I was nine or 10,\" James told BBC Sport. \"He had sort of kept the fact that Wales had a football team from me, and there was basically no football in my house. \"After watching Italia 90 and loving Paul Gascoigne, I thought England were kind of like a British Lions side - I must have been very confused. \"Then I remember watching Wales beat Belgium 3-1 later that year. Mark Hughes, Ian Rush and Dean Saunders scored, and it was our first game in our new Umbro kit at Cardiff Arms Park. \"I genuinely did not realise Wales had a football team until then, but I have loved football ever since - and I have got zero interest in rugby.\" James frequently shows off his favourite football shirts when he plays Owen in BBC Three sitcom Josh, but laments that he is not able to wear all of them. \"That 1990 Wales kit was my first football shirt - I got it for my 10th birthday - but my favourite is the Adidas one Wales wore from 1984-87,\" he explained. \"That was framed in the living room of Josh because, although I was able to wear it initially, there were so many biscuits on set that I put on weight.

They have been playing consistently good cricket, clearly have a good team spirit and a bunch of top-quality, experienced players who have established themselves at international level. This set of players is fearless - I look back at the Champions Trophy final of four years ago, when England lost the plot and subsided against India in the final, and I don't think this team will do that. They have more experience about them. They've got a harder edge. A good indication of England's strength is the fact Jonny Bairstow cannot nail down a regular spot in the team. There have been suggestions England could bring him in for struggling opener Jason Roy but I wouldn't change things around at the moment. It's a shame Bairstow can't get in the side, and Roy does need to start scoring runs soon, but England know what their best side is now. They also have to remember that the Champions Trophy is a competition where every game matters. It's rare this happens in international cricket, where there is always the next game in a three, five or seven-match series. Teams cannot afford any slip-ups and that adds a whole new pressure of its own. Players don't want to look around the field and see nerves - they want to see people they are used to seeing, those they have gone to work with in the past, and those they have absorbed pressure with together. England's biggest rivals for the title are likely to be defending champions India. While all the subcontintental teams - India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka - will want dry pitches to play on, it won't matter too much to India. They are such an experienced one-day team now and are coolly led by Virat Kohli, who is the best in the world at knocking off totals in a run chase. It's an extraordinary knack he has of making a pressurised situation appear anything but. They also have a good variety to their bowling attack and players like Rohit Sharma are just so talented and unpredictable. South Africa are another team I expect to do well, despite them not showing their best form against England in recent weeks. They bat deep and have one of the best opening partnerships in the world in Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla. Those two tick every box - left and right-handed, hard hitter and graceful stroke maker. Australia are always competitive and New Zealand can never be written off, despite being without the retired Brendon McCullum.

{"article": "A poor Burton clearance allowed George Moncur to drill home the opener. Brewers keeper Stephen Bywater made a string of saves before Varney met a Lasse Vigen Christensen corner to head home with his first touch. John Brayford also made an important late block on Tom Bradshaw as Burton held on to guarantee their survival. Nigel Clough's Brewers were rarely troubled by the hosts before John Mousinho's miscued ball out of defence was pounced upon and Moncur coolly finished. The visitors themselves failed to seriously threaten before the break, with a wayward Jackson Irvine header moments before Moncur's strike their best chance. The Tykes pressed for a second, with Bywater making a number of crucial interventions, including a fine effort to keep Angus MacDonald's acrobatic overhead kick out in the 51st minute. Varney, a January arrival from Ipswich Town, made an immediate impact, scoring Burton's first-ever goal against the Tykes as he nodded beyond Adam Davies to equalise from a corner. The forward continued to threaten as he twice tested Davies, while Kyle McFadzean went close to scoring an own goal when he sliced an attempted clearance from a Moncur cross narrowly wide of Bywater's right-hand post. Brayford's intervention late on earned Burton the point they needed to be certain of remaining in the division for a second season, while the draw leaves the Tykes winless in nine games at Oakwell.

The quality that we did have was in the first half on the counter-attack and it was good, intricate play to score the goal. \"The players gave everything for the Barnsley shirt, as they have done all season, but it was incredibly difficult to break down that yellow wall. \"The season's not over. We're really looking forward to going to Newcastle and spoiling their party.\" Burton boss Nigel Clough: \"I'd say this is our greatest achievement because of the clubs we have been up against this season and the strength of the league. \"To get 52 points and survive is a bigger achievement than actually reaching the Championship. \"We have had to play the likes of Newcastle, Aston Villa, Derby and Sheffield Wednesday, week in, week out, so there are no easy games. \"You look at the resources and we are on a par with a lot of teams in League One, but we're not on a par with anyone in the Championship. \"You have to embrace that and say 'we are the smallest club' and get like-minded players who want to come and fight against the odds.\" Match ends, Barnsley 1, Burton Albion 1.

{"article": "Exchanging goods for currency is an age old trusted system for trade. In large groups it fosters co-operation as each party has a measurable payoff. But within small groups a team found that introducing an incentive makes people less likely to share than they did before. In essence, even an artificial currency reduced their natural generosity. The study is published in journal PNAS. When money becomes involved, group dynamics have been known to change. Scientists have now found that even tokens with no monetary value completely changed the way in which people helped each other. Gabriele Camera of Chapman University, US, who led the study, said that he wanted to investigate co-operation in large societies of strangers, where it is less likely for individuals to help others than in tight-knit communities. The team devised an experiment where subjects in small and large groups had the option to give gifts in exchange for tokens. They found that there was a social cost to introducing this incentive. When all tokens were \"spent\", a potential gift-giver was less likely to help than they had been in a setting where tokens had not yet been introduced. The same effect was found in smaller groups, who were less generous when there was the option of receiving a token. \"Subjects basically latched on to monetary exchange, and stopped helping unless they received immediate compensation in a form of an intrinsically worthless object [a token]. \"Using money does help large societies to achieve larger levels of co-operation than smaller societies, but it does so at a cost of displacing normal of voluntary help that is the bread and butter of smaller societies, in which everyone knows each other,\" said Prof Camera. But he said that this negative result was not found in larger anonymous groups of 32, instead co-operation increased with the use of tokens. \"This is exciting because we introduced something that adds nothing to the economy, but it helped participants converge on a behaviour that is more trustworthy.\" He added that the study reflected monetary exchange in daily life: \"Global interaction expands the set of trade opportunities, but it dilutes the level of information about others' past behaviour. In this sense, one can view tokens in our experiment as a parable for global monetary exchange.\" Sam Bowles, of the Santa Fe Institute, US, who was not involved with the study, specialises in evolutionary co-operation. He commented that co-operation among self-interested people will always occur on a vast scale when \"helping another\" consists of exchanging a commodity that can be bought or sold with tokens, for example a shirt. \"The really interesting finding in the study is that tokens change the behavioural foundations of co-operation, from generosity in the absence of the tokens, to self-interest when tokens are present.\" \"It's striking that once tokens become available, people generally do not help others except in return for a token.\" He told BBC news that it was evidence for an already observed phenomenon called \"motivational crowding out, where paying an individual to do a task which they had already planned to do free of charge, could lead people to do this less\". However, Prof Bowles said that \"most of the goods and services that we need that make our lives possible and beautiful are not like shirts\". \"For these things, exchanging tokens could never work, which is why humans would never have become the co-operative species we are unless we had developed ethical and other regarding preferences.\"", "question": "A new study sheds @placeholder on how money affects human behaviour .", "option_0": "reveals", "option_1": "shows", "option_2": "built", "option_3": "published", "option_4": "light", "label": 4}

{"article": "Although a 15-year insurgency in Indian-administered Kashmir ostensibly ended in 2003 when Pakistan agreed to curb the movement of militants on its side of the territory, there have been renewed hostilities since late 2012. General Sharif's latest statement has added to fears that militant violence may resume. But in Muzaffarabad, the men who took the fight to India appear to be keeping a remarkably low profile. Behind the glass front of a small shop at a car wash, a greying man with a lean, youthful physique lifts a saucepan off a gas stove and pours boiling tea in cups arranged in a tray. Another man snatches the tray from the counter and breezes past the door. \"People who come to get their vehicles washed always want tea while they wait for the job to finish,\" he explains. The money he makes at the end of the day, though not huge, is still enough \"to make me thank God for it\", he says. He is a former militant from Indian-administered Kashmir who is now stranded in Pakistan - a refugee, with no citizenship rights and no realistic chance of returning to his village across the border. Once a gun-toting \"freedom fighter\", he now has a wife and kids, in a city where he has no blood relations and no sense of belonging. I point to some recent attacks by militants on Indian positions along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border dividing Kashmir, and ask him if he expects to be recalled to duty by the militant outfit he enrolled with as a fighter. He gives me a long, blank look. \"There's no mobilisation, no queues to enlist for training, no hustle-bustle at the offices of [jihadist] organisations, like the old timesâ€¦\" \"I left my home because I wanted to win this war; but Pakistanis only wanted to needle the Indians. They agreed to a ceasefire, and allowed the Indians to build a fence along the LoC. \"So I think time to liberate Kashmir [from India] by force is up now.\" \"Besides,\" he adds after some brooding, \"I don't want my children to turn out like the children of Afghan refugees, making a living by scavenging on garbage dumps in Pakistan.\" There are some 3,000 to 4,000 former militants from the Indian side in Muzaffarabad - leftovers of approximately 30,000 people who abandoned their homes in Indian-administered Kashmir during the decade following the 1989 uprising, crossing into Pakistan to receive training and arms. Most of them went back to fight against the Indian forces. Many were killed, while many others slipped back into normal lives in homes they had once left. Those on the Pakistani side became stranded when Pakistan, buckling under international pressure, announced a ceasefire with India in 2003 and demobilised all fighters. Nearly all of them are now middle-aged, and are raising families. And the war funds that once sustained them are drying up. Pakistan stopped paying for militant field operations in Indian Kashmir in 2006. In 2012, it halved administrative expenses to jihadist organisations for running their offices in Pakistani Kashmir, forcing all but a few to close shop. These expenses have been further slashed during the last year. The former militants are forced to eke a living out of running road-side businesses or doing day jobs at car washes, construction sites and restaurants. The government pays each former fighter a monthly stipend of 7,000 rupees ($70; Â£44) out of an official account in addition to another monthly payment of 1,500 rupees ($15; Â£9) for each member of his family. While this is not enough for a decent living, families whose male members are alive are more fortunate compared to those headed by war widows. There are thousands of them on both sides of the LoC, and at least 150 are registered in Pakistani Kashmir. Halima Bibi, a former resident of the Uri area in Indian Kashmir, is one of them. She now lives with her two children in a small dark shelter at Ambor, a cramped refugee settlement at the southern end of Muzaffarabad. In 1995, when she was barely in her late teens, her family married her off to a suspected double agent - a militant who had been fighting the Indian forces since 1990 and had just been released from an Indian detention centre in Uri after surrendering. A year after the wedding, he left again for the Pakistani side but was arrested, this time by the Pakistanis, and kept in detention for a further seven or eight months. In 1997, he slipped back into Uri, and told Halima to get ready for a trip across the LoC. \"We walked for two days to cross into Pakistani Kashmir,\" a frail looking Halima recalls. Three years later, he was killed while leading a team of militants into Uri, leaving Halima alone to fend for herself and two children in a strange city. She now lives off the usual government stipend for war widows of about $150 and the $30 a month salary she receives from a local school where she works as a cleaner. I ask her if the war is worth revisiting. \"The war has given us nothing. It has just taken away the men,\" she says with a flat face, without a tear in her eyes. So who launched a couple of recent attacks along the LoC in which a number of militants and Indian soldiers were killed? According to an informed member of a major Kashmiri jihadist group, that was the work of the Lashkar-e-Taiba group which is made up of Pakistani fighters rather than Kashmiris. Such analysis is shared by Arif Bahar, a Muzaffarabad-based Kashmiri analyst, who says there are now indications Pakistan may want to escalate tensions in Kashmir, but only in a controlled manner, using non-Kashmiri groups. This is causing frustration among stranded Kashmiri fighters. \"It is Pakistan's moral and legal responsibility to support us in our struggle to return to our homes with dignity and freedom,\" says Uzair Ghazali, a former militant who campaigns for the resumption of jihad in Kashmir. But oblivious to this longing for home among former fighters, their children are looking to a new future in Muzaffarabad - and Pakistan. And they are helped in this by a number of good quality schools that charge hefty fees from the children of affluent locals in order to fund free education for those who have lost one or both parents to the war or natural disasters. Asad Mir, 16, is a 10th grade student at Sawera (Dawn) Model School, a well-regarded English-medium public school in the upscale Shaukat Lines neighbourhood of Muzaffarabad. His sister also studies at the same school, while his elder brother works as a salesman at a general store. The family lives off the meagre government pay-outs, but he looks neat, confident and relaxed - thanks to free education and free transport to school that is provided  for him and his sister from their home in a refugee camp. \"I love maths. I want to be an engineer,\" he says, with a determined look in his eyes. His father was from Baramulla, and was killed during a militant operation in that area. \"I was just three years old then. My sister was one. They say the [Islamic Front] organisation's vehicle came to pick him up from our home at the camp, and he never came back. My mum says his body was never found.\" Asad says he has no interest in the war, not only because it took away his father, but also because he does not want to go to his father's home and village across the border. \"I don't know anyone in Baramulla. Mum says Muzaffarabad is our home now.

{"article": "Her four-year-old daughter needed the inoculations before she could start school. That's why we saw them coming down the stairs from the clinic on the second floor of an office block in a neighbourhood of Jinan in eastern china. The public did not know about the investigation into the illegal vaccine-network that had been going on for almost a year after the women accused of masterminding it were arrested in April 2015. But since amateur footage of officials raiding a warehouse where some of the drugs were kept was released a few days ago, parents across China have been worried. Four-year-old Suyue's mother told the BBC: \"I hope the government can be more strict about the systemâ€¦ We chose to trust the local clinic after doing another round of research.\" Others have anxieties about what the nurses may be injecting into their children, or what they might have had in the past. But practical considerations have taken precedence. The father of three-year-old Zhang Aiyi stopped to talk to us in the street and said \"we are concerned about the vaccine problem, but we have to do it as each child has a vaccine record\". As his wife held their daughter he said: \"I am not too concerned about whether the vaccine is invalid, we are more worried if the vaccine is poisonous.\" The World Health Organization (WHO) has made it clear that that is unlikely to be a problem, with few or no side-effects for anyone who has taken the illegal traded vaccines. The bigger concern is the potential for an outbreak of the diseases the drugs were meant to prevent, because their improper storage and transport may have rendered them useless. Jinan is at the epicentre of the investigation. A biotech firm with an office in a shabby building at the foot of a block of flats near the centre of the city, is the focus of police attention.

As the BBC's chief athletics commentator, Cram will be covering this week's World Indoor Championships in the United States. But, as a die-hard Sunderland fan, he will also be following updates from Sunday's north-east derby at St James' Park. Cram told BBC Sport: \"We have to win, but both teams need to win - it's a nine-pointer if there is such a thing. \"I think it will be very tight on the day because both teams will be under an awful lot of pressure.\" You can hear more of his tales of supporting the Black Cats on Football Focus at 12:10 GMT on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website. Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. From last weekend's Premier League games, Lawro got three correct results from five matches, with one perfect score for a total of 60 points. He was beaten by world champion boxer Carl Frampton, who got all five results correct, with one perfect score. That gives Frampton a score so far of 80 points, and he can add to that tally when the five Premier League games that were postponed because of the FA Cup quarter-finals are played.

All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated Arsenal have won only one of their past eight games in all competitions - with their sole victory coming in an FA Cup replay against Hull. It is not good enough and, of all the times of the season to hit a wall, this is the worst. This is a bad time to be going to Goodison Park too, because Everton will be buoyed by their performance and win against Chelsea in the FA Cup. Media playback is not supported on this device Goodison is an extremely intimidating place to go when it is really rocking, and it will be the same against the Gunners because the Everton fans will smell blood. Arsenal need to regroup, but the only thing they have really got to play for now is to make sure they are back in the Champions League again next season. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is under a bit more pressure than normal but I think, with his achievements at Arsenal, he has earned the right to be the person who decides when he goes. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Cram's prediction: This is a tough one - Everton have been struggling at home in the league, while Arsenal's season is sort of falling apart. Maybe the Gunners might have something to prove here. 1-2 Match preview West Ham put in another good away performance in their draw with Manchester United in their FA Cup quarter-final and they will probably feel they should have won that tie. Media playback is not supported on this device Chelsea's season was effectively ended by that FA Cup defeat by Everton, and they will be without suspended striker Diego Costa at the weekend. I am tempted to back the Hammers to win again but Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink remains unbeaten in the Premier League since taking over before Christmas, and I think he will rack up another draw here. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Cram's prediction: West Ham have been great away from home, while I am not sure what has been wrong with Chelsea this season. The Hammers to win? I was going to say 3-2, but I actually think it will be a 2-2 draw. Match preview Leicester remain on course for the title after taking 10 points from a possible 12 in some awkward fixtures in the past few weeks. Norwich, West Brom, Watford and Newcastle look easy on paper but they aren't, especially at this stage of the season. I don't see the Foxes winning all their remaining games, however, and I just have a sneaking suspicion they will have a little hiccup here.

Stoke were typically impossible to predict last weekend, and saw their good run ended with a home defeat by Southampton, so I am not sure what to expect from them this time. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Cram's prediction: Is this a candidate for last game on Match of the Day? Probably. 0-0 Match preview Norwich got a great point against Manchester City last weekend but, in their situation, they need to win games. I don't see the Canaries getting anything out of West Brom and they will be watching Sunday's north-east derby because a win for either Newcastle or Sunderland would see them move away from Norwich at the bottom of the table. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Cram's prediction: Norwich are in desperate trouble at the bottom of the table. West Brom are playing quite well at the moment and my uncle Bobby Cram used to play for them in the 1960s so I have always been a pseudo Baggies fan. 2-1 Match preview If Swansea do not beat Aston Villa, then I would be seriously worried about them, especially because of what the three points will do for their survival prospects. The trapdoor has opened a little more for Villa after their defeat by Tottenham, while Swansea will know they can move a big step closer to safety by winning this one. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Cram's prediction: Maybe Villa will start to play now they are pretty much down. 0-1 Match preview Sunderland have had the upper hand in this fixture for a few seasons now but I already saw some improvement from Newcastle in Rafa Benitez's first game in charge, Monday's defeat by Leicester. I cannot tip Newcastle to win, though, because I don't think their players have the correct mindset. Media playback is not supported on this device If they cannot motivate themselves to play when their team is facing the drop, then they will have the same problem with a game against Sunderland. Lawro's prediction: 1-1 Cram's prediction: What do I say? Six derby wins in a row for Sunderland and I would love to see a seventh, but each time I have been left thinking we can't win another one.  That is kind of what I am thinking this time but my heart obviously wants us to win it - and, if we do get a goal, I don't care if it comes in the 93rd minute. 0-1, hopefully. Match preview Liverpool thrashed Southampton 6-1 at St Mary's in the Capital One Cup in December, but I don't see a repeat of that on Sunday. It does not help Jurgen Klopp's side that they played Manchester United at Old Trafford on Thursday, because that will take a lot out of them even though I expect them to win the tie. Southampton are inconsistent, but they got a really good win at Stoke last week, and it would not surprise me to see them produce a really strong finish to the season. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Cram's prediction: Saints will make sure they won't leak as many goals this time. 3-2 Match preview I have nothing but sympathy for Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany because his latest calf injury must have left him wondering what on earth can he do to get it sorted. Media playback is not supported on this device It has happened so many times to him, he has got an inherent weakness and I am seriously concerned about his career. The injury that forced Nicolas Otamendi off against Dynamo Kiev looked a lot less serious - a dislocated shoelace, I think. On behalf of the centre-halves' union, I was embarrassed for him. City will be lying in wait for Manchester United, though, because Louis van Gaal's side have to deal with their Europa League tie with Liverpool on Thursday night. The likes of Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and David Silva are big-game players for City and I would expect them to make the difference. Lawro's prediction: 2-0 Cram's prediction: City are in a better place at the moment and I think it will be a fairly comfortable day for them. 2-0 Match preview Bournemouth's past four games have seen them take 10 points out of a possible 12 but I see their good run ending on Sunday. The Cherries will go at Tottenham but I think that will suit Mauricio Pochettino's side, who are focused on their title bid. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Cram's prediction: Bournemouth are safe so can relax, so I can see a few goals in this one. 3-2 Match preview Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan. *Does not include score for postponed games Lawro's best score: 160 points (week 19 v Guy Mowbray) Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week one v Graeme Swann & week 23 v Ice Cube and Kevin Hart)", "question": "BBC Sport 's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his @placeholder against a different guest each week this season .", "option_0": "hands", "option_1": "wits", "option_2": "side", "option_3": "odds", "option_4": "future", "label": 1}

{"article": "But just how easy is it, and what rules are there - other than no muddy boots in the bedrooms? Cathy and Ian Miles live in the idyllic Kent countryside. Ian, a qualified accountant, was already running his business from home when Cathy lost her job in 2012. The company she worked for went bust, and she was keen to be her own boss too. Six months later she decided to open the Field Green Oast bed and breakfast in her own house. She had no previous experience; her earlier job involved selling exhibition space at big conferences, but she had stayed at a number of B&Bs over the years. \"Having stayed in a B&B I really liked, I spoke to the owner there. She said she organised the rooms with things that she wanted,\" says Cathy. She also did a lot of research, using magazines and the internet. For some of the more technical aspects she consulted with the Pink Book, which is a guide to legislation for accommodation providers in England. She also looked to see whether there were any other B&Bs in her area and whether there would be enough demand for another. David Weston is the chief executive of The Bed and Breakfast Association, the trade association for B&B owners. He believes that running a B&B in your home is a unique business and requires a certain type of person. \"You have to be a people person; somebody who is friendly and enjoys meeting new people. If the whole idea of opening your home to strangers is totally horrific to you, then don't go into this line of business,\" he says. He points out that you have to keep detailed records of your expenditure. Everything from the cost of bacon to the laundry bill is allowable against tax - which can boost your income substantially. He also warns about the extra technical details you have to be aware of. Some B&Bs have closed in recent years because they could not comply with 2006 fire regulations, or would have found it disproportionately expensive to do so. Other areas that are worth checking are what extra insurance you might need. Mr Weston estimates that some 1,000 new B&Bs were set up last year alone and that the industry generates over Â£1.4bn in revenues. For Cathy the online reviews are key to the success she has had so far. But she can't ask her guests to give good reviews; she has to earn them. This is a view shared by Ian Cass, of the Forum of Private Business. He has spent 14 years developing small businesses. \"There are new forms of social media that are coming up all the time that you can use. There are new ways of using the web. You've got to keep looking at new ways of pushing your business forward.\" Cathy and Ian have five children - one has left home, two are at university most of the time, and two still live with them. As well as a large family they also have two dogs and two horses. Cathy feels that despite the sometimes demanding nature of her business it does give her the freedom to be able to organise the school runs and have good quality family time. \"I wanted to do something where I was going to be in charge of my hours and when I worked.\" Cathy and Ian are able to organise the B&B around family life and they feel the business gives them the flexibility to be able do this successfully, while still getting rave reviews for their establishment.", "question": "Sizzling breakfasts , grateful guests , and lots of tax @placeholder - anyone who has stayed at a bed and breakfast has surely wondered idly what it would be like to run their own .", "option_0": "science", "option_1": "communications", "option_2": "head", "option_3": "life", "option_4": "advantages", "label": 4}
{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Divers were forced to compete in water the colour sea lions - rather than Olympians - are accustomed to performing in. Questions were asked on social media. Had Shrek taken an overnight dip? Was it because Roald Dahl's BFG had been drinking frobscottle? On Monday, Tom Daley and Daniel Goodfellow had won bronze in then picture-perfect conditions and even Daley did not know what had happened to the clear water he had dived into just 24 hours earlier. At the Aquatics Centre, Pedro Adrega, head of communications at Fina, swimming's governing body, was flabbergasted, suggesting athletes had perhaps requested for the colour change to lessen the effects of the sun's glare. Inside the press room, American photographers chatted about the possibility that the water had not been treated properly overnight, causing a drop in chlorine levels and the formation of algae. As the competition progressed, the water looked more like pea green soup while the pool next to it - where water polo and synchronised swimming are held - remained in perfect health. \"I've never dived in anything like it,\" said Britain's Tonia Couch, who finished fifth alongside Lois Toulson. \"We noticed it in the warm-up and then by the competition it was even more green.\" Couch said the new colour had made it easier to spot where the surface was while they were spinning through the air, insisting it had not impacted on the result. Once competition was over, organisers released a statement to say that they were still investigating the cause of what was being described on social media as \"pool gate\". \"It's very important to the Rio 2016 community to ensure a high quality of play,\" read the statement. \"Tests were conducted and the water was found to be safe.

{"article": "Played out on a purpose-built site the size of the golf course which was previously there, it sees around 1,000 volunteer performers and crew members gallop through two millennia in around 90 minutes, stopping off for set pieces involving William Shakespeare, William the Conqueror and Sir Winston Churchill. But the scale of the  show is nothing compared to the ambition behind it - to reinvigorate the town of Bishop Auckland, which gazes down the flood plain upon which Kynren stands. Nestled in the heart of County Durham, the town peaked during the Victorian era, but the decline of coal mining has left it and the villages that surround it lacking both employment and funds. Kynren, the name of which is derived from the Saxon for family, is based on Puy du Fou, an attraction near Nantes in France's western Loire region which in the past 40 years has entertained almost 30 million visitors with historical shows, bringing additional prosperity to the surrounding region. It is philanthropist Jonathan Ruffer's attempt to change the local community's fortunes. Ruffer has used the wealth he accumulated during a career in investment management to take a significant stake in Bishop Auckland, planning galleries and museums, taking over the town's castle and purchasing the land on the banks of the River Wear where Kynren is based. He says his interest in the castle \"was the mouth, but Kynren is the trousers\". \"This is the thing that's going to do it. \"What I want to see is people energised into a single community. I saw that in Puy du Fou and I thought what they were doing there would work well here.\" Puy du Fou's president Nicolas de Villiers has served as Kynren's artistic director, bringing his team of French creatives with him to produce the event. He says the show will definitely improve prospects in County Durham, just as his attraction has in the Loire region. \"When someone spends one euro in Puy de Fou, they will spend between two and three euros outside. \"So it's economically very profitable for a lot of people - for hotels, restaurants and all the tourism jobs which are linked to our activity.\" The event, which will run annually, is being run by Ruffer's charitable trust, Eleven Arches - named after the viaduct that towers over the Kynren site. A spokeswoman for the charity says Ruffer's plans are \"brave, radical and transformational\", and will give those living in the area \"what they badly need - opportunity\". The charity predicts the show will bring Â£4.75m a year into the local economy, a figure which Ruffer says is \"not at all pie in the sky\". \"I'm used to analysing figures and they are very robust. \"Simply in terms of the show, it will employ over 200 people - and the multiplier in terms of bed and breakfast, hotels, meals in France is five times that, so we're looking at some really big numbers.\" The show's own profitability is tied to that cast of 1,000 volunteers. Vanessa Pearson, a locally-based credit controller, is one of those who has given her time free of charge to be part of the show. She says she is glad to be taking part \"in something that's going to bring excitement, joy and life back to Bishop Auckland\". \"There's loads of negativity that's going on and people are like 'is this going to work?' But it will. \"Yes, we're not being paid to do it, but we see the vision and it's going to be an amazing project.\" Spectacular and idiosyncratic, Kynren is an often thrilling romp through English history, delivered at a breathless pace. It is an England told through a prism of the North East and comes with more than a passing nod to Jonathan Ruffer's evangelical Christian beliefs. The story sees a bishop guide a young boy through an individualistic choice of English and North-Eastern highlights - the Battle of Stamford Bridge gets equal billing with the one at Hastings, St Cuthbert follows on the heels of Joseph of Arimathea and the pits replace the usually-seen mills of the Industrial Revolution. Brought to life by hundreds of talented volunteers and a supporting cast of horses, sheep, goats and geese, it is a vibrant spectacle that will leave an Englishman's head dizzy from the historical whirlwind. Fellow performer Carl Howe, who plays the Viking chief King Harald Hardrada, agrees it can only be good for the area. He also says it has given the people of Bishop Auckland the chance to try out their performing skills. \"I drive buses for a living so this is the polar opposite of it. \"I sit down all day and on a weekend, I get to dress up like a Viking and run around with a big axe. \"I've done bands, I was a wrestler for a while, and this is just the next thing.\" He says he had no idea what to expect when he volunteered to take part, but is impressed with the result. \"I'm supposed to be a big scary Viking, but at the end, after the finale, I just can't get the smile off my face. \"From start to finish, it flies by.\" The \"epic tale of England\" has been put together by de Villiers' French team, a move that might seem odd, given the nature of the content. The Puy du Fou president does not see it as a problem. \"We are French and we are proud of being French - we know that we are not English. \"But we have put all our hearts and all our energy into making a great English show, so that people will be proud of being English when they leave the show. \"That's the main purpose.\" Ruffer is firm on what he wants the result to be for the locals. \"We have over 1,000 volunteers - why are they doing it? They're not doing it for me or for Bishop Auckland - they're doing it because they're having a great time in meeting with one another. \"It's bringing people together, that's the very heart of the regenerative spirit. \"It's a truism but people are the investment of a region. \"This is a game-changer for the area and it's marvellous to see that we're on the eve of something wonderful.\" Kynren's first season opens in Bishop Auckland on 2 July and runs until 17 September.

{"article": "The speed of change, development and growth in Asia is staggering, particularly when you compare it to the inability of Washington DC to get anything done at all. I had the privilege of being one of the first people to fly out of Hanoi's gleaming new international airport terminal on Monday. The building opened with great Vietnamese fanfare on Christmas Day. But here's what's really impressive - the project was only started in 2009. That is five short years in which to build not only a large new airport terminal but also a six-lane motorway and an impressively high-tech bridge to connect the facility to the centre of the city. Imagine America, or Europe for that matter, being able to accomplish anything that big in that short a time frame. Political divisions in the US Congress mean America can't agree on any new infrastructure projects, let alone something on that scale. And I can tell you, when you fly from the capital of Vietnam to the capital of the world's superpower, you realise it's Washington's airport that desperately needs the upgrade. By comparison with all five of the clean, modern Asian airports I visited during my trip - in Cambodia, Vietnam and South Korea - it was Dulles that felt like it was in the developing world. With so much construction going on in South-East Asia, you would think Western firms would be rushing to invest. But Hanoi's new airport - like Ho Chi Minh City's new subway system - has been built with Japanese money.  From what I could see, the Asian boom is being financed with Asian cash. If I owned a construction company, or a hotel chain, or an airline, or pretty much anything related to travel or tourism, I'd park myself firmly in the East. Take a tour of the Angkor Wat in Cambodia after 9:00am and the crowds of Chinese tourists are almost impressive as the ancient Khmer ruins themselves. Where only 10 years ago there would have been just a handful of intrepid Chinese visitors, outnumbered by Westerners, today there are millions of them. And of course, their numbers will only grow. The new face of global tourism is Asian and any hospitality firm not catering to Asian tourists is missing a profitable trick. I loved my two weeks in Asia. It was the first time I had been back in too long. Despite being dragged round endless sights at the crack of dawn, my kids loved it too, the welcome for them was just as warm as I remembered it when I used to live in Japan.

{"article": "The government is seeking support from Labour MPs to extend the RAF's air campaign to strikes against IS targets in Syria, as well as Iraq. Labour has hinted it would not oppose action in Syria, as it did in 2013. Ms Harman will join senior ministers and military chiefs at Tuesday's National Security Council meeting. The last time a Labour leader received such an invitation was in 2013. The prime minister believes IS fighters need to be confronted in Syria, where the US are conducting operations, but will not take military action without a Commons vote. Some Conservative backbenchers have expressed doubts about further action in the absence of a wider diplomatic strategy so Mr Cameron is reluctant to ask MPs to vote to extend the campaign unless he has Labour's backing. A Number 10 spokesman said: \"The PM thought it was important to ensure the leader of the opposition was fully briefed on the current situation.\" Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker has also been invited. Earlier this month, Ms Harman said Islamic State had to be \"stopped\" and Labour would look \"very seriously\" at any proposals brought forward by the government. She said the situation was different from that in 2013, when Labour voted against air strikes in Syria, because IS was a terrorist organisation, while President Bashar al-Assad was the head of a government, albeit a \"terrible regime\". Labour had been concerned about \"what would fill the space\" if the Syrian president had been toppled, Ms Harman added. Mr Cameron was defeated in the Commons in 2013 when Tory rebels joined forces with Labour to oppose air strikes on Syrian government targets designed to deter the use of chemical weapons. The 2013 vote focused on the Syrian president, not IS militants. Parliament approved UK bombing of militant positions in Iraq last year. However, MPs were not asked at the time to authorise strikes across the border in Syria. The National Security Council meeting comes as ministers are facing criticism for advising UK holidaymakers to come home from Tunisia amid fears of another terror attack. Last month 30 Britons were killed when a gunman opened fire on tourists staying in a popular Tunisian holiday resort. IS said it carried out the attack. Tunisia has accused the UK of playing into terrorists' hands and some tourists complained they were being ordered out of the country. After the Tunisian beach attack, Mr Cameron said IS posed \"an existential threat\" to the West, and its members in Iraq and Syria were plotting \"terrible attacks\" on British soil and elsewhere.", "question": "David Cameron has invited acting Labour leader Harriet Harman to a high - @placeholder security meeting about the threat posed by Islamic State ( IS ) extremists .", "option_0": "term", "option_1": "heated", "option_2": "profile", "option_3": "frequency", "option_4": "level", "label": 4}

{"article": "Britain First did not get permission to use royal emblems on T-shirts and hoodies. Organisations wanting to feature certain royal symbols have to contact the Royal Household. Britain First failed to do so. Now the Cabinet Office has intervened, ordering the party not to use the crown. The Royal Household has issued guidance showing three \"conventional representations\" of the Royal Crown that must not be used without permission. But it says there is nothing to stop the use of other crown designs that do not resemble the Royal Crown. The Cabinet Office - the government's link to the Royal Household - said it had written to Britain First, whose campaign slogan is Taking Our Country Back. Asked what would happen if the party did not comply, a Cabinet Office spokesman refused to say what the next steps would be. The Advertising Standards Authority has also ruled that the party should remove images of the Crown from its website. It followed a complaint from an \"internet user\". In a statement, the ASA said:  \"We understood from the Cabinet Office that the Lord Chamberlain's Office, responsible for authorising official use of the Royal Crown and Scottish Arms, had not granted permission for Britain First to use the royal emblems on their merchandising. \"The design on the clothing was clearly visible on the website pages and in the ad on Facebook and, because we had seen no evidence to show that Britain First was entitled to use the emblems, we considered that the images of the Royal Crown and Scottish Arms had been used without prior permission and therefore breach the Code.\" The ASA wrote to Britain First about the issue but did not get a response.

{"article": "PC James Kiddie, 45, was called to the Uniqlo clothing store in Regent Street, after Sarah Reed, 30, was held by security guards in November 2012. Kiddie said \"snarling\" Ms Reed bit his finger and said she had the Aids virus. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Ms Reed was later convicted of shoplifting. Kiddie, attached to Westminster borough, was found guilty of common assault by Judge Elizabeth Roscoe on 19 February after a three-day trial. CCTV footage played to the court showed him pushing Ms Reed into a chair, grabbing her by the hair and hitting her on the head as she lay on the floor, before leaning on her neck until back-up arrived. Judge Roscoe, sentencing Kiddie to a 150-hour community order, said she accepted his actions had been \"an instinctive and immediate retaliation in anger\". She added evidence on CCTV and of witnesses was that Ms Reed - described in court as a drug addict who was later convicted of shoplifting - was a \"difficult\" and \"aggressive\" woman who had become more aggressive when the police officer arrived. He was also ordered to pay £500 in prosecution costs, and a £60 victim surcharge. Kiddie had told the court his strikes against Ms Reed were \"half-power\" and he had not wanted to hit her. The Met said in a statement the officer - who has served for 12 years - was the subject of two substantiated complaints - in 2008 for lack of courtesy and respect and in 2011 for discriminatory comments. He was also due to face a misconduct meeting this month with regard to the discharge of CS gas at a demonstration in January 2011, the Met added. The process behind the previous complaints is to be reviewed. Scotland Yard said fellow officers who had viewed the Uniqlo CCTV footage had been concerned by the level of force used by Kiddie during the arrest and reported the incident to the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards. Kiddie's defence counsel, Ben Brandon, told the court the officer would be dismissed from the Metropolitan Police as a result of the court's findings.", "question": "A police officer who punched a suspected shoplifter in the head before pinning her to the @placeholder has been sentenced to a community order .", "option_0": "public", "option_1": "house", "option_2": "ground", "option_3": "body", "option_4": "island", "label": 2}
{"article": "The investigators have produced 13 reports, the evidence in each is harrowing. Villages destroyed, crops burnt, wells poisoned, torture, rape, starvation sieges, mass bombing of civilians, and what only a decade ago might have been unthinkable - chemical weapons. There is no doubt that war crimes have been committed by all sides, the commission says. In each report there is a demand for \"accountability\" - that no-one should be allowed to commit such horrific acts and get away with it. \"This would be incredible, a scandal,\" says commission member Carla Del Ponte, who describes the violations in Syria as by far the worst she has ever come across. \"But nothing happens, only words, words, and more words.\" Ms Del Ponte, as a former prosecutor at the tribunal for Yugoslavia, and the woman who put Slobodan Milosevic in the dock, knows how to bring war criminals to book. While the Syria commission has no power to prosecute, what it does have is a vast amount of evidence, and a confidential list of names, thought to include figures at the very top of the Syrian government and military. To bring those individuals (including, Ms Del Ponte thinks, President Assad) to court, the UN Security Council would have to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court. And throughout the Syria conflict, the Security Council has been divided, with Russia and China in particular resisting what they regard as unnecessary interference in Syria's problems. Now, though, the United Nations, under new Secretary General Antonio Guterres, appears to be flexing its muscles. A new body has been set up, called, rather dryly, the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism or IIIM, to sift the evidence, build cases, and pass them to any court that could have jurisdiction. Some European countries are already opening cases. At its head is an experienced French judge, Catherine Marchi-Uhel, who has worked on the tribunal for former Yugoslavia, and the Extraordinary Courts of Cambodia, which prosecuted the Khmer Rouge. \"This gives me hope that something is moving,\" says Alain Werner, director of Civitas Maxima, a Swiss organisation that works to ensure justice for victims of war crimes and crimes against humanity. \"I didn't even think this body would be set upâ€¦ this is proof [the UN] is serious.\" Mr Werner's own organisation has already built cases against suspected war criminals from Sierra Leone and Liberia, and his work with victims has shown him, he says, that \"the eagerness for justice is immense\". One of his colleagues, Antonya Tioulong, knows personally just how important this can be. Her sister and brother-in-law were tortured and murdered in Phnom Penh's notorious S-21 detention centre during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In the 1990s, almost two decades after her sister's death, Antonya was able to learn what had happened to her, and she tried to bring a case in the French courts against the Khmer Rouge officers who had run S-21. It was rejected. \"I felt powerless. There was no sign, either, of an international tribunal. I wondered, 'Were the two million victims of the Khmer Rouge genocide so unimportant in the eyes of the world that the criminals did not need to be judged?'\" Antonya had to wait until 2008, when an international tribunal was finally set up. The men who murdered her sister were at last convicted. She was comforted not just by the verdict, but by the fact that the tribunal was public. \"Thousands of people came from all over the world to attend the hearings in person, showing their desire to understand what happened.\" But many thousands of victims still wait. In the Swiss capital, Berne, the Red Cross Centre for Victims of Torture and War had more than 4,000 consultations in 2016 alone. \"Almost the most important thing is that they have the space and time to talk,\" says psychologist Carola Smolenski. \"We have patients from former Yugoslavia who still suffer chronically from their experiences.\" For many of these patients, however, there may never be a public tribunal where perpetrators are convicted, and the suffering of their victims formally recognised in a court of law. Instead, the Red Cross Centre has included a form of \"validation\" process as part of the therapy. \"We will prepare [together with the patient] a detailed chronological report,\" says Carola Smolenski. \"We recognise the experience together, and we sign it as witnesses.\" \"It is important that they can say, 'That is my story, and it is being taken seriously.'\" For the millions of Syrians waiting in refugee camps, or trapped in besieged cities, peace cannot come soon enough. But millions of Syrians, too, are waiting to know the fate of loved ones who disappeared into Syria's prisons, or vanished in the heat of battle. In Geneva, the UN peace process is inching along. In the talks about Syria in the Kazakh capital, Astana, the Russians, Turks, and Iranians are working to negotiate \"de-escalation zones\" to reduce the violence. But in neither the Geneva process nor Astana is there much talk of accountability for the undoubtedly massive number of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is unclear whether the newly formed IIIM has a role in the peace process at all. Could this be because leaders, on all sides of Syria's conflict, might not be motivated to reach a peace deal if they thought a war crimes trial would be their reward? \"You might have put your finger on it,\" says one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. The idea that achieving peace, or at least an absence of war, should take priority over justice is often advanced during tricky diplomatic negotiations. Some also suggest that war crimes tribunals can sow the seeds of future discord, particularly if victims are from one ethnic group and perpetrators from another. Archbishop Emeritus of Cape Town the Most Reverend Desmond Tutu famously did not want a tribunal for South Africa, pushing instead for a truth and reconciliation process, in which the accused would acknowledge their crimes but also be forgiven by their victims. The UN's human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, agrees that creating sustainable peace is a complex process, but insists that the authors of Syria's suffering must be formally prosecuted. \"In Syria, there will never be peace if you don't put the victims at the centre of your effort,\" he says. \"You can have the most finely crafted agreement, but if victims don't feel justice, then it is worthless, a pointless exercise. There has to be an accounting, the central authors must be brought to book.\" Nevertheless, he sees prosecutions as only part of the process. \"At a fundamental level, we will never have permanent peace if we don't deal with unresolved issues.\" This means, he says, all sides in a conflict recognising their conduct, and showing \"contrition\". And there, Mr Hussein says, society must play its role. During the German trials after World War Two, he points out, there were 7,000 convictions, but few of those convicted showed any remorse. The push for contrition and remorse came later, through work by German historians, school teachers, and post-War politicians. Alain Werner agrees that, in view of the scale of the atrocities in Syria, \"it is very difficult to think there will be no justice\". But, he adds, because the number of cases is \"staggering\", justice is unlikely to be swift. \"Syria could take 40 yearsâ€¦ even 100 years to investigate.\"", "question": "For six years , the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria has been painstakingly gathering @placeholder about possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict .", "option_0": "statements", "option_1": "advice", "option_2": "questions", "option_3": "evidence", "option_4": "information", "label": 4}

{"article": "The city was reduced to rubble during what became known as the \"Swansea Blitz\". About 35,000 incendiaries and 800 high explosive bombs were dropped during the raids which started on 19 February, 1941, killing 230 people. The raging fires could be seen from the other side of the Bristol Channel in Devon. Swansea was targeted because of its nearby docks and part of the Germans' bombing campaign was to cripple exports as well as demoralise civilians and emergency services. It resulted in whole areas being completely cleared and rebuilding starting from scratch. \"Pre-Second World War Swansea had begun to look and feel like a city,\" said Bangor University's Dr Dinah Evans, whose research includes the impact of warfare on, and reconstruction of, Swansea. \"Hotels, restaurants and cafes abounded, together with theatres, art galleries, concert halls and shopping arcades. Wednesday 19 February - Friday 21 February, 1941 \"In the commercial centres of Wind Street, Castle Street and High Street the pavements were wide and the shops fronting onto them stylish, selling merchandise of all kinds. \"The department stores were imposing and many of a calibre usually found in London. \"However, when in 1941 Swansea came under enemy attack from the air, the face of the town was changed for ever. \"Although the town's Guildhall, art gallery and library were still standing when the bombing stopped, its social and entertainment heart had all but disappeared. \"The town centre was destroyed and Swansea people had to contend with a bleak landscape where once prosperous shops and stores had stood.\" Dr Evans said the council was under pressure to produce a plan that would not only restore those areas damaged in the blitz but also ensure the future prosperity of Swansea. She added: \"Meanwhile rumours began to circulate in the press that Swansea town's reconstruction progress compared unfavourably with other bombed cities, especially that of Plymouth. \"However, when it came to the question of rebuilding a blitzed town or city centre, there were limits to what could be achieved. \"The war effort had all but bankrupted Britain and the financial stringencies of post-war Britain would conflict with the visions of many local authorities for the reconstruction process. \"Swansea was no exception; the plans of its town council for a new shopping and commercial centre were subject to endless delays, shortages and restrictions. \"The rebuilt town centre, some 20 years later, was a product of its time - functional but with little style, the outcome of inadequate funding.\" Since then, plans have come and gone to regenerate the city centre on a huge scale, including the doomed Castle Quays project which was first mooted in 1994 and scrapped 10 years later. Respective ruling councils have struggled to find an alternative option, with the most recent failure the collapse of a £1bn transformation project. \"There's been no real major investment in Swansea,\" said Chris Holley, who led the city's council from 2004 until 2012. \"Most development companies look at the city and say there's not enough wealth to invest in the city centre. \"After the war there was investment but we had more factories and more jobs and they've all gone now.\" \"Now it's the case of not having the disposable wealth which would generate sales across the patch and we haven't got a huge travel to work area.\" Mr Holley pointed out the amount of investment Cardiff has received over the years and the Welsh capital is thriving both in the city centre and Cardiff Bay. Swansea has failed to significantly move forward but planners hope the latest plans, unveiled in January, will finally give the city centre the regeneration it needs. The £500m project will be the biggest landscape change since the blitz and work is due to start in 2017. It will include a 3,500-seat arena, an aquarium and a new shopping area along with the creation of a city beach area with bars, restaurants, offices, 5-star hotels and homes which will open on to an extended promenade and the beach. \"I think St David's [shopping area and cafe quarter] would be great for the city centre,\" said Mr Holley, who is leader of the council's opposition. \"If we can build the arena, it will help the city centre with footfall. \"I'm not too sure about the civic centre development as that appears to be mostly flats.\" Only time will tell.", "question": "Seventy - five years after German bombs rained on a thriving Swansea for three successive @placeholder during World War Two , efforts are still being made to regenerate its centre .", "option_0": "nights", "option_1": "powers", "option_2": "groups", "option_3": "activities", "option_4": "events", "label": 0}

{"article": "How important are trade unions to the Labour Party? The Labour Party grew out of the trade union movement at the beginning of the 20th Century when, following a special trade union conference, the Labour Representation Committee (LRC) was formed out of unions and other left wing organisations. The LRC sponsored the first two Labour MPs elected in 1900. Today many Labour MPs come from trade union backgrounds or have close links to unions. In fact, you must be a member of a trade union to be eligible to seek selection as a Labour candidate, unless for some reason you have been prevented from doing so. The old system of direct trade union sponsorship of MPs no longer exists, but many Labour MPs receive substantial donations to their constituency party. What's changed? In 2013, former leader Ed Miliband proposed historic reforms to the relationship between the party and the unions following a row over candidate selection in Falkirk. A special Labour Party conference passed party reforms in March 2014, bringing in one member one vote for Labour leadership elections and opt-in for trade union affiliate Labour members. The old electoral college, which gave unions, party members and MPs/MEPs a third of the vote each, was abolished. For the next leader, voting will take place on a one-member-one-vote basis in a single section comprising Labour Party members, affiliated trade union supporters and registered supporters. How much money does Labour get from the trade unions? The trade unions provide the majority of recorded donations to Labour and in the past it has been income Labour could rely upon. In 2014 unions donated around £11m to Labour, accounting for about 58% of total donations received that year. Its top donors were Unite, Unison and Usdaw. The Electoral Commission's donation figures include the affiliation fees that trade unions pay to the Labour Party in return for the privileges of affiliated membership for themselves and their members. For a union to affiliate nationally, it must pay £3 from its political fund for each member that it wishes to affiliate. But the way in which trade union members affiliate to Labour is undergoing changes at the moment. Previously trade union members had been automatically affiliated to the Labour Party unless they pro-actively chose to opt out. Now they must choose to opt-in. Trade unions will still collect a levy from their members but this will go into their own political funds rather than automatically to Labour, though they can still chose to donate this money to Labour if they wish to. Some argue that this puts Labour's finances at risk, whilst other see it as an opportunity to change the party's funding base. Labour highlights the income it receives in donations too small to be registered with the Electoral Commission. Figures released to the BBC show that small donations and membership accounted for 35% of Labour's income in 2014. How many affiliated trade union supporters does Labour have now? In the 2010 Labour leadership election, about 2.7 million ballot papers were distributed to trade unionists. No-where near that many trade unionists will be entitled to a say this time around. Currently the party has just 500 affiliate trade union supporters who have 'opted-in' under the new system, though Labour expects that figure to go up massively in the coming months as the trade unions begin a recruitment drive.", "question": "Labour 's relationship with the trade unions is under the spotlight again as the party 's leadership contest gets under way and following criticism by outgoing Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy of the @placeholder of the Unite union .", "option_0": "aftermath", "option_1": "end", "option_2": "benefits", "option_3": "influence", "option_4": "state", "label": 3}

{"article": "Mr Zhou was, until his retirement in 2012, one of China's most powerful men. He headed the Ministry of Public Security and was a member of China's top decision-making body. Once Xi Jinping took over as president in 2013, however, he was put under investigation. A formal probe was announced in July 2014, after months of rumours, and he has since been expelled from the Communist Party. Mr Zhou's case had been sent to a court in Tianjin, a northern port city, Xinhua news agency reported. The head of China's top court said last month he would have an \"open trial\", though no date has been announced. In a brief statement, China's top prosecution body said that the allegations against Mr Zhou were \"extraordinarily severe\". \"The defendant Zhou Yongkang... took advantage of his posts to seek gains for others and illegally took huge property and assets from others, abused his power, causing huge losses to public property and the interests of the state and the people,\" it said. Anyone who finds themselves formally indicted with a criminal offence in China knows the likely outcome. But Zhou Yongkang will know better than anyone. He once ran the country's domestic security apparatus, with his power stretching into the court system, the police and the intelligence services. He will eventually be found guilty, of course. But we should hesitate before swallowing too readily the claim by the Chinese authorities that the downfall of so senior a figure proves the effectiveness of the anti-corruption campaign. The real question to ask is this: given that so many other senior Communist Party figures, past and present, have used their positions to enrich themselves and their families, why him? The answer must surely be that there is no good reason, other than a political one. Zhou Yongkang may well have been hugely corrupt, but he will be tried by the same opaque, pliable model of Communist Party justice that he himself did much to strengthen and perfect. Profile: Zhou Yongkang Xi cages big tiger in anti-corruption drive The former security tsar, who is in his 70s, is the most senior official to be targeted in decades. He was previously one of nine members of China's highest organ, the Politburo Standing Committee. It has since shrunk to seven members. But Mr Zhou has not been seen in public since late 2013, when rumours of a probe first emerged. A number of his former associates from his time both in the oil industry and as Communist Party chief in Sichuan province are already being investigated or prosecuted as part of Mr Xi's corruption crackdown. His former protege, former Chongqing Communist Party chief and high-flyer Bo Xilai, is currently in prison on charges linked to his wife's murder of a UK businessman. Analysts say the investigation into Mr Zhou allows Xi Jinping - who took office as president in March 2013 - to consolidate his power base, remove people opposed to his reforms and improve the image of the Communist Party. Timeline: Zhou Yongkang 1942: Born in Wu Xi city in eastern Jiangsu province 1964: Joins the Communist Party and spends the next 32 years in the oil sector 1998: Becomes party secretary of China National Petroleum Corporation 1999: Appointed party secretary of Sichuan 2002: Appointed member of the Politburo at the 16th Party Congress; becomes minister of public security later that year 2007: Further promoted to member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo - China's highest state organ 2012: His lieutenants begin to get sacked and investigated; he appears with Bo Xilai at Chinese National People's Congress session December 2013: His son Zhou Bin is arrested on corruption charges December 2014: Arrested, expelled from party", "question": "China 's former security chief Zhou Yongkang has been charged with bribery , abuse of power and the intentional disclosure of state @placeholder , state media report .", "option_0": "intelligence", "option_1": "office", "option_2": "state", "option_3": "secrets", "option_4": "media", "label": 3}

{"article": "Apparently, it takes us 45 seconds on average just to confirm who we are. Now that might not seem very long, but if you're a global bank like Citi receiving 35 million calls a year in Asia alone, that adds up to 437,500 hours of staff time a year. That's a lot of money. But by using computers to identify our voices, this authentication process can be cut to 15 seconds on average, saving the bank pots of cash and us lots of hassle. Citi has just begun rolling out this kind of voice biometrics authentication for its 15 million Asian banking customers, starting in Taiwan, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. The bank expects to have one million Asian customers using the technology after a year, and three million after three years. Other banks, like Barclays, have used voice biometrics for private banking customers, and are now working to expand it for retail customers. In voice biometrics, there are two approaches. You can speak a fixed phrase - a popular one is \"my voice is my password\". Record a \"voiceprint\" of this a few times, and afterwards your voice gets checked against this saved sample. The other approach involves \"free speech\" - monitoring your natural conversation as you chat with the call centre. After a few seconds, a message on the customer service representative's screen tells them the system has verified your voice, or asks them to conduct further traditional checks if not. This \"free speech\" method has become possible at much greater scale due to better algorithms analysing voices in more detail. Whereas fingerprints give you fewer than 20 points of measurement and comparison, voices offer more than 1,000, says Brett Beranek, director of voice biometrics product strategy at Nuance Communications. Physical characteristics, such as the length of your tongue and the thickness of your vocal cords, contribute to the uniqueness of your voice. Then there are personality traits - the tone and pitch, the way you pronounce certain syllables and words. The latest computer algorithms can analyse all these hundreds of variables and come up with a near-certain authentication within three seconds. The fixed \"passphrase\" method takes just 1.5 seconds to authenticate. \"If in the serious research community you said you'd be able to do free-form speech in three seconds, most people would've laughed at you five years ago,\" Mr Beranek says. Citi uses the \"free speech\" method to begin a more natural conversation with the customer immediately, says Derek Allgood, managing director of Citi's telephone banking in Asia. This approach works better in talkative cultures like Australia, he says. \"Whereas in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, customers tend to be less chatty,\" says Mr Allgood. So in these countries the bank has had to adapt the script to be more interrogative, to get enough audio for a voiceprint. Free speech has another advantage: it's harder to fake a realistic conversation using recordings. With the passphrase method it's plausible that fraudsters could record a customer's voice as he or she says the phrase and then use this high-quality recording to try to spoof their way through security in future. So does voice biometrics actually help reduce banking fraud? Given that the average person has 19 passwords and many of those are weak and easily guessed, the fact that you can't forget your voice and that it's unique to you, should prove to be an advantage. And as the authentication process takes place at the bank's end of the call, it's certainly easier from the customer's perspective. Five years ago, the technology was mostly about compiling a watchlist of voiceprints associated with known fraudsters and checking this against all incoming calls, says Erica Thomson from Israel-based software company, NICE. Checking your voice against a \"whitelisted\" voiceprint - known to be yours - has only become possible at scale in the last two years, she says. But it isn't cheap. It tends to cost businesses about Â£10m ($13m; â‚¬12m) to begin authenticating customers with voiceprints, says Matt Smallman, a consultant who has worked with several banks on their voice biometrics. \"But it does pay for itself in both security and efficiency,\" he adds - global financial fraud losses run into billions. This is why banks in particular are investing so heavily in it. Of 150 million voluntarily enrolled voiceprints in the world at the moment - up from 70 million a year-and-a-half ago - the financial services sector accounts for slightly more than 50% of the total. \"Government and telecommunications are tied next at around 20%,\" says Dan Miller from San Francisco-based Opus Research. The drawback with the system is that banks need to obtain customers' permission before recording voiceprints. From 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation will require organisations to say what data they collect on you, for which purposes, and to obtain your explicit consent. Some customers say no, but usually only around a quarter, says Ms Thomson. Citi's Asian efforts seem to bear this out, with a 75% uptake so far. A few banks - Atom Bank in the UK and USAA in the US, for example - ask new customers to register their voice, face and passcode, and let them choose which to use. And as the technology gets cheaper over the next five years, we could soon be talking to parking meters, vending machines, robot hotel concierges and driverless taxis, to pay for things and check in. Our voices could unlock the connected world.

{"article": "Noureddine Bouterfa said there would be an informal gathering of Opec members on the sidelines of an energy conference in Algiers on Wednesday. \"We will not come out of the meeting empty-handed,\" the minister added. The fall in prices has been causing problems for poorer members of Opec. Oil prices collapsed from peaks of more than $100 a barrel in mid-2014 to near 13-year lows below $30 in January. The price on Friday was $44.48 a barrel. Analysts remain gloomy about the chances of an agreement. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: \"Given that Opec has failed to agree much of anything in the last 12 months, it seems unlikely that it will start now.\" Opec's 14 members, which produce about a third of the world's oil, have so far failed to agree a deal to cut output that would prop up prices. But the state of the oil market was \"more critical\" than when Opec last met three months ago, Mr Bouterfa said. Crucially, Saudi Arabia, the largest Opec member and which has resisted production curbs, may now be more willing to cut output, he added. Saudi Arabia pumped a record 10.69 million barrels a day in August compared with 10.2 million in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Although Wednesday's meeting is an informal gathering, Mr Bouterfa did not rule out it becoming a formal event. He said: \"Either we reach an agreement, which would be good, or we reach an understanding on the elements of an agreement, and that would also be good. \"Every state in the organisation agrees on the need to stabilise prices, it just remains for us to find a format that pleases everyone. The best solution would be a (production) freeze.\" Opec members are losing between $300m and $500m a day, Mr Bouterfa said. \"No (oil) company will be able to withstand it if prices remain under $50 a barrel,\" he added.", "question": "Oil producers in the Opec @placeholder of countries will make another attempt this week to reverse a slump in crude prices , according to Algeria 's energy minister .", "option_0": "number", "option_1": "west", "option_2": "group", "option_3": "language", "option_4": "state", "label": 2}
{"article": "The flight ban to the Egyptian Red Sea resort followed the suspected bombing of a Russian airliner on 31 October 2015, killing all 224 people on board. A group of more than 30 travel firms is calling for a decision on when direct flights from the UK can resume. The government said British nationals' security was its \"top priority\". Sharm el-Sheikh previously attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors from the UK each year, making it an important resort for airlines and holiday companies, But flights from the UK to the airport were suspended on 4 November last year, and the Foreign Office continues to advise \"against all but essential travel by air to or from Sharm el-Sheikh\". Between January and September 2015, Egypt hosted 728,942 British travellers. Numbers for the same period in 2016 dropped 70%, to 172,018 UK visitors. More than 30 travel companies including TUI Group, Saga Holidays and Expedia have formed a partnership - The Travel Industry Egypt Advisory Group - to work with the Egyptian tourist office in London and lobby the UK government for a decision. They fear that if the uncertainty is not ended soon, it will be too late to include the destination in their winter 2016/17 programmes. Rasha Azaizi, director of the Egyptian State Tourist Office in London, said: \"This long-term ban on flights to Sharm el-Sheikh is now affecting many UK travel businesses as well as airlines and is causing deep consumer confusion. \"The Foreign and Commonwealth advice is currently that it is safe to visit Sharm el-Sheikh but not to go through the airport. \"That's given people the impression that they can't visit Egypt when in fact British Airways, Easyjet, Thomas Cook, Thomson and EgyptAir are already operating direct flights to other airports in Egypt.\" UK holidaymakers heading to Sharm el-Sheikh are currently forced either to take multiple flights or book a place on a ferry from the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. Travel insurance for UK tourists remains valid in the resort itself, but not for Sharm el-Sheikh airport. Last week Belgian airline Jetairfly became the latest operator to announce that it would resume flights. The German government lifted its flight ban earlier this year, and in September Turkish Airlines recommenced flights from Istanbul. Some UK holidaymakers are taking advantage of these flights. Peter and Julie Gallagher from Halifax returned from Sharm el-Sheikh 10 days ago after travelling via Istanbul. They've visited Sharm el-Sheikh at least once a year for the last five years, staying at the resort's Savoy hotel. Julie said: \"The security at the airport is very much improved. It's probably a little over the top if anything. We cannot understand why the ban is in place. \"We had an amazing holiday even though the resort is struggling and they don't deserve this.\" Her husband Peter described it as as \"an ideal holiday\". He said: \"We were due to go in early November last year and that was stopped [because of the suspected bombing of a Russian airliner]. We tried again in December, then in February. We just kept booking with our travel agent. \"We always stay in the same hotel. The manager told us that 80 hotels have been closed down.\" The Egyptian State Tourist Office said it was \"time for the British government to make a decision before the crucial winter holiday season.\" Ms Azaizi added: \"No other country apart from Russia still has a ban on flights to Sharm el-Sheikh, but the UK government has still not yet made a decision. \"We have been led to understand that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Department of Transport are all now happy with the measures put in place following stringent security reviews.\" A statement from the Department of Transport said: \"The security of British nationals is our top priority, and we took the decision to suspend flights from Sharm el-Sheikh in November last year to protect the travelling public. \"We keep aviation security under constant review.\" On Wednesday Monarch announced that, \"with no indication from the government as to when the airport will re-open to flights from the UK\", it was cancelling all flight and holiday bookings to the resort \"for the foreseeable future\". Chief executive Andrew Swaffield said: \"Much hard work has been done by the UK and Egyptian governments, along with the travel industry, to improve safety measures at Sharm el-Sheikh airport and it is very disappointing that it remains closed.\" Airlines including Egyptair, British Airways,  Easyjet, Thomson and Thomas Cook are still flying from the UK to other parts of Egypt.", "question": "The government has been urged to set a @placeholder for the resumption of UK flights to Sharm el - Sheikh , one year after they were suspended over terrorism fears .", "option_0": "date", "option_1": "precedent", "option_2": "revised", "option_3": "looming", "option_4": "petition", "label": 0}

{"article": "The incident outside the Ghost nightclub in Leicester struck a chord with Jackman, who tweeted in response to the story. He says himself, his brothers and friends have all experienced racism outside nightclubs in London. \"I remember standing outside a Mayfair club after finishing a big performance with a couple of other contestants off The Voice and The X Factor and other TV shows,\" he says. \"I remember standing outside for an hour and I was hearing excuse after excuse from the bouncers.\" Eventually one of the organisers of the concert got him admitted but his friend, who is Turkish, was still refused entry. It was not the first time he had been turned away from a club. Partway through filming The Voice, Jackman changed his haircut after being turned away by another doorman in an incident he believes was racially-motivated. \"I remember one of the security guards saying 'We don't know your haircut, it might be a gang-affiliated type of haircut',\" he says. \"You've got so many black people who've been affected by [being turned away] who want to shed light on it and expose it for what it is,\" he adds. \"I have friends who work in the promoting industry and they tell me 'Jermain, you won't believe what I heard today. I had to quit my job today because of what this woman from a club told me, that they can't let my black friends in'.\" Jackman's experience appears to be far from isolated. James Ataguba, a law student and blogger, also tweeted @BBCEngland, saying he had experienced similar discrimination trying to get into clubs. He said doormen usually gave excuses to him and his friends, such as them being \"too drunk\" to get in, but on another occasion one had specifically mentioned his race. \"I was very mad as the bouncer was winding me up as well,\" he says. \"He said I didn't have rights, he said I should stop wasting my time and that myself and my friends should go somewhere more 'colour friendly'. \"I'll never forget. It makes me feel small, like something about me is not good enough to be in the same place as everyone else.\" So what is it like from the doorman's point of view? Is race a consideration when deciding whether or not to let someone to get in? One former doorman, who asked not to be named, said he laughed when he saw the video of the Leicester incident - but not because he agreed with the doorman's actions. Rather, as a young Asian man who had experienced the same thing trying to get into clubs, he was glad the incident had been filmed. \"When I saw that I couldn't stop laughing because I thought that happens day in, day out, and someone has got it on camera for a change,\" he says. He worked as a doorman for about six years at various venues in Nottingham city centre and says there was \"a lot of stigma around groups of Asian lads and black lads\". \"It was one of those really awkward situations where, even if you knew them, you would have to turn them back.\" He says doormen have to make a judgement call about potential customers and this was partly based on their appearance. Black or Asian people are sometimes turned away because doormen perceive - consciously or subconsciously - they are more likely to cause trouble, he believes. But he says managers have also specifically told him they do not want black or Asian people in their premises, particularly large groups of black and Asian men. He remembers working at one bar in Nottingham in particular. \"The manager said 'I don't really want Asian or coloured people in here',\" he says. \"In my head I was thinking 'I don't want to work here'.\" But is discrimination in the nightclub queue simply a matter of race? Fashion and lifestyle blogger Fisayo Longe says in her experience discrimination happens to black men more often than to black women and she is normally allowed into clubs. However, she says she was once told by a white club employee in London she was being refused entry either because of her race or attractiveness. She says he told her: \"Maybe because you're black, but there are some black people inside. Probably because you're not good looking enough.\" The club declined to comment when it was contacted by the BBC. \"These doormen don't realise the impact that their actions have on people,\" she says. \"I was angry that we wasted time and money and both angry and sad that this sort of thing still happens.\" So what is the legal position? Solicitor Martin Howe says the law stipulates clubs cannot turn people away because of their race, as this is classed as a \"protected characteristic\" under the Equality Act 2010. The law applies equally to gender, meaning groups of men also cannot legally be refused entry. He was among a group of people turned away from an Irish Travellers conference at a Wetherspoon pub in London, which resulted in the pub chain being ordered to pay Â£24,000 in damages last month. Just weeks later Wetherspoon admitted liability in a similar case, agreeing to pay Â£10,500 to three Travellers who were refused entry to a pub in Cambridge. However, Mr Howe believes the rise of the mobile phone and social media may be about to change the situation at the nightclub door for good. He says phones are causing a \"revolution\" in the area of racial discrimination because they enable people to record video evidence - such as when Chelsea fans were filmed singing racist chants and refusing to let a black man on a Paris Metro train. And the reputational damage this can cause can be more satisfying than any financial reward, he says. \"If you've got it on a mobile phone you've got a video with a soundtrack. \"If you've got the evidence, getting it recognised publically is much more important than any damages or money involved.\"", "question": "Jermain Jackman shot to fame as winner of BBC One 's singing @placeholder The Voice - yet despite this he was once barred from an after - party for one of his own gigs .

Mr Nuttall's so-called integration strategy has already been panned by former UKIP donor Arron Banks, who accused him of going to \"war\" with Muslim communities.

However the Muslim Council of Britain's secretary general Harun Khan condemned the move, and is due to say at a Muslim leadership dinner: \"It is deeply regrettable that the UK Independence Party is singling out Muslims in the most negative terms. \"This is not leadership - and it is certainly not becoming of a party seeking to represent British people. \"Together with Britons, Muslims will be looking for true leadership that unites our country during this time of uncertain transition and seek to represent all British people, and certainly not scapegoat some. Bigots must not be allowed to set the terms of the debate.\" Meanwhile, Mr Whittle said Mr Nuttall \"probably will\" stand in the 8 June general election, after the leader sidestepped the question at an event on Monday.", "question": "UKIP 's foreign affairs spokesman has resigned his @placeholder in protest at leader Paul Nuttall 's plans to ban the burka .", "option_0": "future", "option_1": "participation", "option_2": "appearance", "option_3": "post", "option_4": "position", "label": 3}
{"article": "The decision comes little over a month before Germans head to the polls. The AfD hopes to enter the parliament in Berlin for the first time. Prosecutors asked the Saxony state parliament to lift Ms Petry's immunity after a campaign financing inquiry. She is suspected of making false statements under oath before a parliamentary committee in November 2015. Ms Petry is a co-leader of the the nationalist AfD and its lead candidate in Saxony for the 24 September federal election. Prosecutors will be able to press ahead with the case if, as expected, no objections are raised by other members of the state parliament. She has said in the past that she is relaxed about the case. AfD is currently polling at around 8% in German opinion polls and already has delegates in 13 of Germany's 16 state parliaments. Among its policies are a call to declare Islam incompatible with German culture and a plan to strip immigrants convicted of serious crimes of their German passports. The party's fortunes have declined in the past year, partly because of internal wrangling but also because immigration has become less of an issue in German politics. Parties need to reach a 5% threshold of the vote to enter the Bundestag. What does the AfD want? Ms Petry was instrumental in moving the AfD to the right after it was founded as an anti-euro movement. In 2016, amid the influx of migrants and refugees into Germany, she suggested that police should, \"if necessary\", shoot at migrants seeking to enter the country illegally. In April she stepped back from the party leadership to have her fifth baby after losing an internal fight to steer the AfD towards a more moderate course. Controversially, she was then pictured with her baby in July in an AfD campaign poster.", "question": "A parliamentary committee in eastern Germany has called for Frauke Petry , one of the leaders of Germany 's right - @placeholder Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , to lose her immunity from prosecution over allegations of perjury .", "option_0": "planned", "option_1": "term", "option_2": "known", "option_3": "wing", "option_4": "based", "label": 3}

Andrada said an additional problem in Rio is ticket-holders only wanting see one particular contest in a long session. The athletics began on Friday with a world record for Ethiopia's Almaz Ayana in the women's 10,000m, and Britain's Jessica Ennis-Hill opening her defence of the heptathlon title she won in London. However, media outnumbered fans at the start of competition, and by lunchtime the stadium was barely a quarter full. For the start of the evening session, which featured the likes of Jamaica's two-time Olympic 100m champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the stadium was less than a fifth full. Rio 2016's organising committee has been criticised for the ticket-pricing structure, considering the country is in the midst of an economic recession. It has denied high ticket prices have put Brazilian fans off, while the International Olympic Committee said prices offered to overseas fans were not too high. Velodrome: There were a few empty seats at the start of the second day of track cycling, but the venue was soon full and numerous Union Flags on display hinted at a big British presence. Tennis Centre: The crowd for Andy Murray's match was disappointing but Rafael Nadal's quarter-final win against Brazil's Thomaz Bellucci generated the best atmosphere of the week from an almost full stadium. Equestrian Centre: The team dressage final failed to attract a large crowd to Deodoro, with the centre less than half full all day. Carioca Arena 3: It was a similar story for day seven of the fencing competitions, where the men's team final was poorly attended.

The BBC based its decision on new rules for how broadcasts should be allocated. The BBC Trust guidelines highlight an \"unexpected discrepancy\" between the number of UKIP MPs and its vote share. Party political broadcasts take place three times a year in England, Scotland and Wales and once a year in Northern Ireland. The latest allocations were announced on Monday, with UKIP joining the Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dems in the list of parties being offered broadcasts in England. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said she was \"astonished\" her party was being denied \"vital broadcast coverage\". \"We've grown as a party by more than three times in the last 12 months,\" she said. \"I'm starting to wonder what exactly it is that we need to do to convince the BBC to grant us fair representation.\" The party said it would request an urgent meeting with the BBC and urged support for a petition on the 38 Degrees website. The BBC Trust, which carried out a public consultation on the new criteria for inclusion, said the previous guidelines, set in 2012, \"did not anticipate the anomaly arising from an unprecedented discrepancy between representation (seats) and share of the vote in the last general election\".

{"article": "The age of anxiety is upon us: We may move across any metropolis in the 21st Century with that nagging feeling of doom, wondering where next a terror attack may come. Africans are increasingly encountering this anxious age at home and abroad - what would Brussels and Paris be without their Africans? Insane calculations have already concluded that small family hotels in Burkina Faso or beachfronts in Ivory Coast are legitimate terror targets because once upon a time, in the days of colonies, they were a part of France - and France, as we know, has found herself in the frontline recently. It is not just Francophone Africa that is a target - the random violence has hit universities, buses, football bars, markets, churches and mosques West and East Africa - everyday social situations where human beings thrive and interact. These recurring incidents in African cities are a ringing alarm that all African states simply have to up their security game. In reality, every African capital may become a target, regardless of their religious affiliations. Aeroplanes themselves, no matter how rigorous the security, can be hijacked by lone militants or pining lovers - as an Egyptian man so recently demonstrated when he took over a domestic flight to land in Cyprus. And we know from recent history, that aeroplanes have been used as weapons of destruction. There are several glittering new airports across Africa these days, and we long for the cost of inter-city connections to drop so we can holiday in Accra as easily as we fly to Atlanta. But the airport tragedy in Brussels raises questions on security for Africa's aviation ports, not least for Nigeria and Kenya, where Islamist insurgents are a constant presence. The Nigerian newspaper This Day reported very recently how travellers thought placing mugshots of Boko Haram militant suspects around local airports was ineffective and that the underlying problem for a secure airport was about stamping out corruption amongst airport security. You know the story at some African airports: You are a traveller who likes to live on the edge of the clock; you are late for your flight; you get rid of the last of your change in any currency by handing it over to a man or a woman in uniform, who in turn promises to get your suitcase on the plane and to wave you through the VIP check-in with minimum fuss. Farai Sevenzo: \"An official has seen fit to question the validity of your passport and simply disappeared with it, leaving the obvious implication that you must pay something in order to see it again\" You watch your luggage go through the carousel without hindrance from man or X-ray machine; you get to the departure lounge in time to purchase a duty-free single malt. You depart. And for thousands of travellers who would not stoop so low as to bribe their way to a convenient and easy departure, the picture may be the same - with small but serious variations. You are on time but cannot move past the throng of travellers caught up in a bottleneck in front of three or four security personnel, who, to supplement their meagre wages, are trying to extort the change you do not have. You may have already made it to the check-in desk, but an official has seen fit to question the validity of your passport and simply disappeared with it, leaving the obvious implication that you must pay something in order to see it again. You eventually see your luggage being carried through by a porter because the baggage carousel is not moving, nor is the X-ray machine blinking with its usual invasive intrusions because both machines are suffering from a lack of electricity in that part of the building. You are afraid of dogs, but stand by as they sniff your case. Yet the sniffer dogs are trained for drugs, not explosives, and you may wonder which one of your fellow passengers knows this for a fact. You hear a commotion behind you as a woman wails that her purse has been stolen and tell yourself that only a foolish thief would steal at an airport where close-circuit television catches your every move - and then notice that this particular airport is in the process of installing cameras and that the thief was lucky. And so the anxiety rises. Aviation security expert Adebayo Babatunde told This Day that the most potent weapon against terror was intelligence - and called for the sharing of intelligence across airports and across nations. \"We must follow international security procedures, there should be no compromises. If a bag is unattended, remove it and destroy it and governments should urgently acquire explosive detection systems,\" he added. The world this year is already smaller than it was last year - we move around in greater numbers legally and illegally.

{"article": "So it was again today when he met Nicola Sturgeon in Bute House. And yet there is caution too on the first minister's side. Why so? Competing mandates - and sundry thoughts as to how those mandates are most effectively exercised. Both leaders took pains to describe today's talks as constructive.  Yet both leaders retain distinctly different visions as to the final constitutional construct which could emerge. Mr Cameron has, behind him, an overall Commons majority. He has the votes in the House. He could, if he chooses, wield that majority to legislate on Scotland as he chooses. But he knows - and Nicola Sturgeon gently but firmly reminds him - that Scotland tends to prefer discussion to diktat. He is reluctant to resort to an early, overt rebuff in the light of the sweeping gains made by the SNP last week in the UK elections. And so the prime minister offers to listen. He offers to consider ideas advanced by Ms Sturgeon as to further powers - beyond the Smith Commission agreement - which might usefully be devolved to Holyrood. There is, to be clear, little evident enthusiasm in that offer. Mr Cameron makes clear that his preference, his primary concern, is to implement the Smith package in full, through legislation in the Commons. Which is where the divisions lie. Ms Sturgeon wants to go considerably beyond Smith. She wants devolved control of employment, the minimum wage, National Insurance, substantial welfare powers and equality policy - in addition to the control of income tax rates and bands plus a limited share of welfare featured in Smith. And she wants discussion on these matters to proceed via debate within civic and political Scotland - as well as in the Commons.  The two leaders, therefore, differ on substance and process too. Apart, of course, from the small matter that, ultimately, Ms Sturgeon wants to end the Union which Mr Cameron strives to defend. But Nicola Sturgeon is cautious too. She has disavowed gesture politics. She says the people of Scotland want and deserve mature representation by their elected tribunes. Given that, she is unwilling to precipitate a crisis in the talks - at least too speedily. The issue here is exit strategy. She can cajole, she can persuade, she can demand.  But, if the PM says no, what then?  He has the votes in the Commons. Again, down the line, Nicola Sturgeon could appeal once more for popular support in Scotland, citing claims that Westminster has neglected Scottish demands. Equally, if not handled carefully, an early collapse of this renewed process might simply demonstrate that the SNP presence in the Commons - huge and vocal though it is - remains a UK minority, part of the opposition. So Ms Sturgeon will seek to obtain what she can by consensus, by co-operation, by persuasion.

{"article": "Campaigners want to stop traffic from passing under St Laurence's Gate, a Norman fortification. The County Louth town at the mouth of the River Boyne is steeped in history. The 5,000-year-old Newgrange tomb is nearby, as is the Battle of the Boyne site. The town also hosts King William's mace. Oliver Cromwell laid siege to Drogheda and is reputed to have slaughtered many, but that is now disputed by some. The town was once a walled fortress and some of those fortifications remain, including St Laurence's Gate which was built in the 13th century. At the moment traffic can pass under the gate, but independent councillor Kevin Callan hopes that will soon change. \"When you look at the structure and its history, it was there to protect Drogheda from sea invasion,\" Mr Callan said. \"It withstood Cromwell and many invasions and really and truly to have it damaged by a truck that could close it down after 800 years, it would be an absolute sin if we were to allow that to happen.\" Sin or not, a truck recently got stuck trying to pass through the arch of the stoned fortress known as a barbican. The image was published in several newspapers. St Laurence's Gate consists of two lofty circular towers joined together by a wall with strategically placed opening to allow the defenders to see out. Historian Audrey Smith is the secretary of the Close the Gate Campaign. \"Our idea is to protect the gate and all the medieval structures in Drogheda and make the gate the gateway to the north east and for Drogheda to be the jewel of that,\" she said. It's a laudable goal and one that seems to have the support of many townspeople. Hillary Kelly, who works in a local art gallery, said: \"From a practical point of view it's really dangerous for traffic.  And as a tourist attraction we can't really use it. \"People can't get near it or up on it because it's dangerous.  We closed it to traffic at the beginning of May for a festival and for four hours people were able to get up on the monument and there are fantastic views of the sea and all around the countryside from it. \"It got booked out in no time.  So, there is a market and for tourists to come and see it.\" Andrew Spearman, a photo-journalist, said: \"It should have been closed to traffic years ago.  It's a no-brainer.  If the will was there on the council, it would have been. But they've been arguing for so long they've forgotten what they're arguing about.\" So, who, you might wonder is opposed to stopping traffic - estimated at more than 1,000 vehicles a day - from passing through the gate? \"Taxi drivers\" I was told, because they believe it would add to the already bad congestion. But, among them there was divided opinion and no one wanted to be interviewed on camera.

{"article": "Africa will go through six human actions this year - it will stand, kneel, squat, bow, fall and then rise again. Here's how. In the group of those who will be standing in Africa in 2017 is Donald Trump. Yes, I know it's an act of treason to associate him with Africa. But when he's sworn in as president, his foreign policy (or tweetplomacy) will have a bearing on our continent. His critics warn that his isolationist stand might mean less attention will be paid to Africa. But it could just force Africans to find solutions from within, by strengthening our institutions, improving infrastructure, governance and security and trading more amongst ourselves. Another man who also takes office in January is Nana Akufo-Addo, the president-elect of Ghana. He's tried to enter Flagstaff House (the presidential residency) through the ballot box as the New Patriotic Party candidate since 2008. Now that he has the keys, Ghanaians will wait to see how he delivers his pledge of one district, one factory, lest he becomes one man, one term. And then there's the state of emergency in Ethiopia, which still stands. It was put in place last October following violent protests. The government says the security situation has improved save for some clashes in the northern part of Amhara region. Some 9,000 people detained under the state of emergency have been released and the government says it could lift the emergency before its six-month period is over. There are two prominent men who will be kneeling before voters to ask for a job. Paul Kagame has been president for the last 16 years, but Rwandans appear to want more of him and have voted to remove the term-limit barrier. In August, Mr Kagame will therefore use his constitutional right to ask for a new employment contract. In the same month, his Kenyan neighbour Uhuru Kenyatta will also be reapplying for his job. Last September, while warning the main opposition leader Raila Odinga to mind his own party and leave the ruling Jubilee party alone, President Kenyatta famously said: \"â€¦ as you continue to search for a seat and salivate, we are feasting on the meat\". It will be clear in August whether Kenyans will give Jubilee more time to feast or turn the party itself into mince meat. Joseph Warungu: \"The Nigerian economy... enters 2017 in the squat position\" The African Union has been searching for a new Chief Executive Officer and will fill the position in January. Three men and two women from Botswana, Kenya, Chad, Senegal and Equatorial Guinea will fight it out to replace the outgoing South African Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as Chair of the AU Commission. Now to some situations and people who can't decide whether to stand or sit. The Nigerian economy has caught its nastiest stomach bug in more than two decades. And so it enters 2017 in the squat position. A combination of factors including a crash in the global price of oil, which Nigeria relies a lot on, and a fall in the naira, the country's currency, contributed to the sizeable contraction of the economy in 2016. The anger and frustration among the people was aptly captured by this online comment from one Nigerian in November: \"We are now going into depression and deep S***! Buhari has himself to blame for unfortunately being a gentleman!\" Over in The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh is no gentleman - he's chosen to squat at State House. He lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow and publicly conceded defeat. A little later, the thought of leaving the seat he has called his own for the last 22 years overpowered him and he changed his mind. Africa and the world have asked him to go home, but he is defiant. As his last day in office approaches on 19 of January, the same force he used to gain power in 1994 could be used to relieve him of his office. There are three notable people who will be bowing out of office in 2017. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa, is coming to the end of her second and final term of office in Liberia. One of those waiting on the touchline to join the succession race is football star George Weah. The former AC Milan and Chelsea striker failed to score in the 2005 presidential tournament but hopes 2017 will be his year. Angolans will have a chance to replace the only man they've known as president for nearly 40 years. Although Jose Eduardo dos Santos has announced he'll step down, his blood will still flow through the veins of power and the economy in Angola. His daughter, Isabel, heads Sonangol, the state oil company and is considered by Forbes to be Africa's richest woman, while his son, Jose, is chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, Fundo Soberano de Angola. In neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, 2017 could mark the beginning of the end for another family dynasty, which started in 1997 when Laurent Desire Kabila became president after overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko. Laurent Kabila's son Joseph picked up the reigns after his father's assassination in 2001, and was bent on staying in power until attempts to change the constitution to allow him a third term backfired. Violent street protests have piled pressure on President Kabila to exit from office this year and the issue is bound to continue into the new year. The theme of falling is alive in South Africa. The #FeesMustFall campaign by university students sought to fight the rising cost of higher education and saw violent clashes between police and protesters, disruptions in the university calendar and the arrest of a number of students. 2017 promises more of the same because not only have the fees not fallen, some top universities have announced an 8% increase. And then there's the question of the country's President Jacob Zuma. In December 2017, his tenure as leader of the governing ANC party runs out, but his term as the country's president only ends in 2019. Allowing Mr Zuma to continue as head of state but with the ANC under someone else's leadership could create two centres of power, which could be political suicide. So will the ANC #LetZumaFall as it did President Thabo Mbeki under similar circumstances? 2017 will have answers. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is another that could face the threat of falling in Africa if more African countries continue to withdraw from the Rome Statute. A number of countries have notified the UN Secretary-General of their intention to withdraw, saying the ICC unfairly targets African leaders in its application of international justice. And now to international trends where fashion, like history, has a habit of repeating itself. A quick glance at catwalk signs for 2017 shows that the hems of women's skirts will be falling - to just below the knee. Apparently midi-skirts elongate the figure and flatter the wearer, so this must be a good fall. The Africa Cup of Nations tournament kicks off in mid-January in Gabon and Uganda carries the hopes of East Africa. The region has a terrible record in continental football. Uganda's last appearance in the finals was in 1978 when it lost to Ghana in the final. Kenya and Tanzania have never progressed beyond the group stage, so if Uganda can rise, East Africa can stand tall. In politics, despite all manner of socio-economic challenges, the spirit of the Africans is on the rise - they've already just about removed one long-serving president from power (The Gambia, even if he is still resisting ) and in 2017 a couple more might follow (DR Congo, Angola) When Africa stumbles, it must rise because as they say in Nigeria, the sun shines on those who stand before it shines on those who are sitting.

{"article": "Quietly spoken, Jack Lowe is a man on the verge of his dreams. A life-long love of photography and lifeboats has finally put him on the road around Britain's coast. Having given up the Newcastle printmaking business he ran for 15 years, he plans to record all 237 of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution's stations on glass plates with a 110-year-old camera. \"It was like stepping towards the edge of a cliff and hoping that your flying suit would work,\" he says. \"I wanted to make things again, things that are actually photo-graphy, drawing with light,\" he says. \"Making light interact with chemicals and having a physical object people can refer to in 100 years' time. \"The second thing is engagement, participation. It becomes a collaboration because their time is no more or less valuable than my time and we make it together. \"Not only that, but they see within seconds the image appear. So they get an instant bit of reward for their efforts.\" Jack, 39, is quietly delighted by the effect the result has on its subjects. \"Sometimes they're moved to tears,\" he says. \"Tag, the Aldeburgh coxswain, we were just there together. His eyes welled up when he saw it appear out of the chemicals. \"You pour fixer on the image and it switches from negative to positive before your eyes - magical.\" Joanna Quinn, from the RNLI, says the crews photographed so far have found it an \"involving and exciting experience\". \"It's hard to articulate why the pictures are so effective but I think it's something to do with the fact that they look quite timeless,\" she says. \"Lifeboat crews, though they change through the years - there are more women now, for example, than there ever have been - what they do has always been consistent. \"They are always willing to go out and save lives at sea and I think that continuity and that history is something that's reflected in his pictures.\" This is the RNLI that \"captivated\" the eight-year-old Jack. Living on a boat at Teddington and Ramsgate harbour probably helped. As did visiting his dad on the Isle of Wight and seeing where Atlantic 21 lifeboats, which he thought were \"so cool\", were made. Jack spends at least a day at the lifeboat stations and the Victorian process he uses is not swift, like the instant click of a digital shutter. An image is produced on a glass plate - coated with chemicals and still wet - when it is exposed to light through the camera. A fixative stops the process and sets the picture - known as an ambrotype. Having converted his bedroom into a dark room at the age of 12, it is perhaps not surprising that Jack has done the same to an old ambulance, called Neena. The process has to be started and finished in about 15 minutes, unlike rolls of film which can be developed later, so he needs facilities to hand. The less light there is - specifically UV - the longer the camera's shutter has to remain open.  If the subject moves, the image will blur. \"These are four, five, six, seven-second exposures,\" Jack says.  \"It makes for beautiful work because they have a peace about them. \"You have captured a few seconds in the glass. They've been thinking things and their hearts have been beating.\" With exposures of up to 12 seconds, willing participation is essential. An overcast location and the need to walk repeatedly between camera and dark room along a 150m (300ft) pier meant it took far longer than usual to photograph Cromer coxswain John Davies. \"John isn't known for his patience with photographers,\" Jack says. \"But there was a moment after about two and a half hours where he could tell that I was as dejected as he was. \"I just sat down and put my head in my hands and I said, 'I'm really sorry about this John'. \"He said to me - out of the blue, I didn't expect this at all - he said 'don't worry Jack, we'll crack this'. \"This is an eighth generation Cromer coxswain. He's been at sea since four in the morning. He's the only one in the station. He's just there for the photograph.\" Jack's intention is for the RNLI to own the completed collection of glass ambrotypes, which the organisation says \"would be a remarkable thing\" for it to have. It is committed to sharing them with as many people as possible, through an exhibition, book or gallery, it says. Jack gives the first print from each ambrotype to the station or crew member and pays for the project - and \"puts food on the table\" - by selling further prints to anyone who wants them. With a loose rule of thumb to go north when it is warm and south when cold, he expects to visit Scotland next. And then, one day, after the four or five years his project will take, he will become a lifeboatman, he says. \"I will be.

{"article": "Not unjustifiably, in Hamilton's view his former team-mate Nico Rosberg managed to win the championship only because of a reliability record at Mercedes skewed in his favour. As such, in Hamilton's mind, he might have lost, but he was not beaten. Rosberg has gone this year, replaced by the former Williams driver Valtteri Bottas, but that is a detail that does not change Hamilton's primary focus. \"I definitely don't want to finish second,\" the three-time champion says. \"Every year you generally set the same goals but you might add more. All drivers want to win but not everyone has the ability or the opportunity. \"I am looking for that fourth world championship. It's there for the taking again. I am up against another great driver in Valtteri and hopefully Red Bull and Ferrari will be up there as well.\" Losing out to Rosberg in 2016 clearly hurt. And, unsurprisingly perhaps, Hamilton has been distinctly prickly when asked about how he was affected by it. \"Nowhere near as much as you think,\" he said at the launch of the Mercedes car. \"It doesn't change my life. You just move onwards and hopefully upwards.\" And that was your lot. Hamilton turned 32 in February, is heading into his 11th season in F1, and has described himself as \"the same old\" Lewis this year. But Mercedes people detect a subtle shift. Rosberg's decision to retire was always going to shift the dynamic in the team. He and Hamilton were the same age and their rivalry went back to their teens, when they were karting contemporaries, team-mates and friends. The friendship died, killed by the intensity of being each other's only rival for the biggest prize in motorsport. But there was always an inherent balance between the two. Hamilton's talent and fundamental superiority on the track meant he was always the dominant figure in the team. But the German had been at Mercedes for three years longer and, a much less demanding character, had a more stable relationship with the team and the company. He was Mr Corporate and Dependable, whereas Hamilton, for all his greater status and appeal, was harder to manage. Media playback is not supported on this device In one sense, little will change with Bottas' arrival. Hamilton is who he is, and he will be just as determined to win again. He will remain the superstar in the team; the low-wattage Bottas likely an even more hassle-free employee than Rosberg was. The two will have equal status and they will compete for wins in the same way as Rosberg and Hamilton did. Hamilton has made clear some things will not change for him personally. The restless lifestyle, the frequent trips to New York and Los Angeles to pursue his wider interests are still very much on the agenda. \"Self-motivation is difficult for the human race to find each year and each day,\" Hamilton says. \"I am very lucky I have fans, family and friends who motivate me to grow and be better every day. I will always do the things I do and explore the world and meet new people and new cultures.\" Some in F1 see this as a negative, as a reflection that Hamilton is not fully focused on the job in hand if he is flying back and forwards across the Atlantic so often. For Hamilton, it is a way of keeping boredom at bay and using a creative outlet to stimulate him and keep him centred. In another way, though, there has been a reset for Hamilton this year. The baggage and residual complications of Hamilton's rivalry with Rosberg have gone and been replaced with a more fundamentally straightforward team-mate relationship. And removing that tension has simplified matters within Mercedes. Inevitably, Mercedes will lean on Hamilton more - because of his record, his length of time with the team, and because Bottas is inevitably still learning the ropes and does not yet carry the gravitas that repeated success brings. That gives Hamilton an opportunity to strengthen his position, which he is already doing by exploiting the influence and motivational possibilities his status gives him. Hamilton, it is said, has if anything been working harder and better than ever during preparations for the season - and so far has stepped up to the leadership opportunity that Rosberg's departure presents. There were plenty of frictions between driver and team last year - Hamilton's controversial comments about engine failures; his behaviour at the Japanese Grand Prix when he walked out of a news conference; the team's attempt to interfere in his battle with Rosberg at the final race of the season. But these were sorted out in a clear-the-air meeting in the kitchen at team boss Toto Wolff's pristine Oxford home before Christmas. The result of all these factors, insiders say, is that they are seeing a more mature and reflective Hamilton so far this year. Wolff said at the Australian Grand Prix on Saturday: \"There was a point towards the end of the year where we sat down and it felt like a reset of the relationship and so many things came out which needed to be discussed. And since then I have perceived him as being in a really good place. He is happy, he is motivated and I have seen the strongest Lewis that I have seen so far consistently over the weekend.\" How the pressures of the on-track battle affect all this will be clear only as the season unfolds. Pre-season testing had suggested Mercedes would face some genuine opposition from Ferrari this season, and the opening grand prix weekend in Australia has confirmed it. Hamilton took pole, and looked superb all weekend, but this is a track on which he has usually excelled and Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari was only 0.268 seconds behind him. And the 32-year-old is now expecting a close fight with Ferrari, not just in Melbourne on Sunday, but over the whole season. \"They are obviously very close and that is great for the fans,\" Hamilton said. \"I wouldn't say there is relief. I truly believe in all the work they have done but in testing I really couldn't have done the lap he had done. \"But coming here I felt even if we were behind, it doesn't matter because I have the strongest team. The fact we have come here and we are still ahead is a beautiful thing but they are very close I have to keep applying the pressure and that is what I am here to do.\" Media playback is not supported on this device The fact Bottas was within 0.3secs of him in his first qualifying session with Mercedes will have made Hamilton sit up and take notice - he praised the Finn for doing a \"great job\" afterwards. And the prospect of a battle with Vettel is just another reason for Hamilton to be on top of his game this year. It is no secret that Hamilton regards McLaren's Fernando Alonso as his only true rival out on track in terms of outright ability - each has expressed their admiration for the other's talent often enough - and the fact Vettel has won more titles than them burns both Hamilton and the Spaniard. This season is Hamilton's chance to put the record straight, equal Vettel's tally of four titles and beat him in a straight fight doing it. \"Ferrari have done such a great job so we have to stay on our toes,\" Hamilton said. \"I am down for the battle with anyone. He is a four-time world champion so of course I want to be racing with him because if I finish ahead it makes me look good, it makes me look better.\" It was a theme Hamilton had already addressed over the winter. \"I've never wished to go out and dominate,\" he says. \"Of course I want to have a car I can fight for a title with, but for the fans it's best when there's multiple teams fighting.\" For the first time since the start of Mercedes' domination in 2014, it looks like Hamilton will get his wish.

Of all 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales the overall pass rate was 98%. The City Of London Police had the highest pass mark, with all 120 tests taken by its officers proving to be successful.

{"article": "Officers have been instructed not to exercise discretion, but issue tickets for speeding and seatbelt offences and for using a mobile phone while driving.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Using wing-backs Mattia de Sciglio and Alessandro Florenzi to brilliant effect, they were the more potent attacking team until they withdrew in defence of their lead in the final stages. Giorgio Chiellini scored the game's opening goal, bundling home from close range after David de Gea had parried an Eder free-kick in greasy conditions in the first half. And Southampton striker Graziano Pelle sealed victory in injury time, volleying home from eight yards after an attempted clearance from substitute Matteo Darmian's cross had looped up invitingly as Italy hit a tiring team on the break. The scoreline could have been a lot worse for Spain were in not for a series of outstanding saves by Manchester United keeper De Gea. He made three in the first 45 minutes before smothering an effort from Eder in the second half after he had been put clean through by a sublime flick from Pelle. Italy played with an intensity and fierce determination that hinted at their ambition to avenge their 4-0 defeat in the 2012 final. It was only in the latter stages that they were subjected to any threatening, sustained pressure - but Sergio Ramos headed wide and Gianluigi Buffon saved long-range efforts from Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique. And with full-time looming, Buffon made a brilliant dive to his right to save a close-range effort from Pique before Italy broke clear to score their decisive second. Spanish newspaper Marca ran the headline 'The End' after Spain were eliminated from the 2014 World Cup in Brazil after just two matches. If it was not true then it certainly looks it now after La Roja's run as European champions was ended by a team that swarmed all over them and seemed to have a hunger and desire no longer present in their opponents. Spain boss Vicente del Bosque is out of contract and the side he has so memorably coached since taking over from Luis Aragones after the 2008 European Championship seems in need of fresh impetus. The fact that they brought on a 35-year-old striker with just one previous international goal in Aritz Aduriz at the break perhaps hints that they are a team that needs a new direction. Former Spain international Xavi had said in the build-up that this would be a \"troublesome match\" - and he was correct. Spain looked like a boxer with too many rounds in the legs and only the imperious Iniesta offered any sense of attacking drive and craft. Sergio Busquets failed to exert much influence on the tie and David Silva was another peripheral figure on a night when Italy seldom allowed their opponents any time on the ball. Indeed, if it were not for the brilliance of De Gea the tie would surely have been over by the break. He made three sensational saves - a Pelle header, a brilliant and acrobatic over-head kick from Emanuele Giaccherini that he tipped on to the post and a one-handed effort at full stretch to thwart the same player after he drifted inside from the left. Chiellini - part of an all-Juventus back three with Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli - said before the match that it would be settled by the small details and his side played like a team that left nothing to chance. From the intensity with which they sang the national anthem to the way in which they took the match to Spain as the heavens opened at the start, they played with an incomparable determination. And all the while coach Antonio Conte prowled his touchline. He must issue more than a thousand positional instructions during a match and Chelsea fans can look forward to an electrifying presence in the dugout next season. The speed with which Italy - playing 3-5-2 - transitioned from defence to attack and made the most of wide areas was something their opponents could not contend with. Spain could not pass their way through a superbly organised Italian side and did not have the speed to get around the edges. When Pelle scored the decisive second goal with seconds remaining Conte leapt on to his team's dugout. He might have come into this tournament talking down his team's chances - and said before the match on Monday that Spain were \"big favourites\" - but he exhibits the body language and drive of a man who believes his side can go a long way. Italy goalscorer Giorgio Chiellini:  \"We deserved this win. We could have killed the game off earlier. \"After years of Spain dominating, we have been able to get some revenge. This is just the beginning, we will enjoy this victory but there is still a long way to go until the end. The best is to come.\" Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said: \"They were probably better. They don't play great football but they are strong in the air, very physical and they were dangerous. \"We came out in the second half with a chance and the players tried to do the best they could. We tried everything but we couldn't score.\" Spain go home after suffering their first knockout defeat at a major tournament since the 2006 World Cup, when they undone by Zinedine Zidane's France in Hannover. Italy can look forward to a quarter-final tie against Germany in Bordeaux on Saturday.

She said she was \"really excited\" that her 113,000-signature campaign had attracted so much support. Ms Nelson will give evidence at a parliamentary inquiry into modelling and health issues, which begins later. MP Caroline Nokes, chair of an all party parliamentary group on body image, launched the inquiry after supporting Ms Nelson's campaign. She said they would discuss whether government legislation could be necessary to ensure models were not forced to become \"unhealthily thin\", and will hear evidence from industry professionals.

She said: \"When I returned to the same agency they told me to lose more weight, they wanted me 'down to the bone'\". She said she wants to see tighter checks on a model's health: \"If a model is being asked to lose weight, she can go to a doctor and say 'I need to get down to 35 inch hips' and the doctor can then say you can lose weight this way'. \"Some girls are doing really drastic things to lose weight, they're eating cotton [wool], they're eating only popcorn.\" Ms Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North, said: \"Firstly we want the girls working in the fashion industry to be healthy. \"Secondly we want them to be good role models and we want images that young people see in advertising and on the catwalk to be of healthy positive young women.\" The Association of Model Agencies (AMA) said its members train staff to recognise symptoms of eating disorders.

{"article": "Former MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove said EU-based security bodies were of \"little consequence\" and that leaving the EU could boost Britain's security. But Europol chief Rob Wainwright said the argument \"doesn't stand scrutiny\", saying intelligence sharing was vital. The in-out referendum on the UK's membership of the EU is on 23 June. Security has been a key argument in the debate so far, with In campaigners saying being in the EU makes the UK safer and Out campaigners arguing the opposite. Earlier this week, UKIP leader Nigel Farage was criticised for saying EU border rules led to \"the free movement of terrorists, of criminal gangs and of Kalashnikovs\". David Cameron said it was not \"appropriate\" to use the Brussels attacks to further arguments in the referendum debate, but Mr Farage said In campaigners had already \"politicised\" the security issue. Writing in Prospect magazine, Sir Richard - head of MI6 from 1999 to 2004 - argued that leaving the EU could strengthen Britain's security. \"Brexit would bring two potentially important security gains: the ability to dump the European Convention on Human Rights... and, more importantly, greater control over immigration from the European Union,\" he said. He said it was better to conduct intelligence sharing on a bi-lateral basis, and argued that there would be no damage to the UK's close security ties with the US. He also criticised Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency, saying the 28 members had \"vastly varying levels of professionalism in intelligence\" and its meetings must accommodate the \"slowest and leakiest ship.\" But speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, its boss, Rob Wainwright, said police co-operation across the EU to fight terrorism and crime had improved considerably over the past decade - and that the UK had been a \"driver\" of that work. \"The scale and level of the integration the UK now has with its EU partners in this domain is considerable. I see the benefits of that for British police authorities everyday.\" He said that as a part of the EU, the UK was able to take advantage of the European Arrest Warrant and had access to a network containing details of 300,000 wanted criminals and missing people. \"By making an argument that we would be better off by not having these arrangements at all I don't think stands much scrutiny,\" he told Today, adding that it was a \"serious miscalculation\". Former head of GCHQ, Sir David Omand, has also entered the debate, saying the UK \"would be the loser in security terms from Brexit not the gainer\". He said the \"stronger security on the continent of Europe is, the safer we will be\" and warned that leaving the EU would \"jeopardise\" intelligence sharing. But pro-exit MP David Davis, former Conservative shadow home secretary, said it was \"ridiculous\" to suggest intelligence sharing would not continue if the UK left the EU, saying the UK \"is the biggest, most powerful\" intelligence operation in Europe. But he added: \"We mustn't overestimate the extent to intelligence co-operation is absolute. It never can be.\" Mr Davis said some of the perpetrators of the Paris and Brussels terror attacks had been able to \"move freely\" throughout the EU which was \"just one practical example of the damage done by the free movement of people to international security\". \"Many of these killers... were EU citizens which means that even though we're outside Schengen we can't stop them coming to Britain,\" he added. He also criticised EU plans for visa-free access for Turkish citizens - as part of a deal for Turkish help in tackling Europe's migration crisis - saying it will mean \"we've opened up the access for terrorists\".

{"article": "Could there be a time when everyone from schoolchildren to pensioners, and artists to accountants top up their natural abilities with some funky head-gear? There have already been suggestions that electricity can boost mathematical talent and now researchers in Australia have found a way to boost problem solving. The team at Centre for the Mind at the University of Sydney believe people find it difficult to think \"outside of the box\" because they become blinded by past experience. So if someone is used to solving a problem one way, the brain struggles to come up with new solutions. They used these well-known Roman numeral maths problems: In the first puzzle you have to change the numbers so that \"3 = 9 - 1\" becomes \"3 = 4 - 1\". But after repeatedly doing the puzzles in which you have to change the numbers, the brain struggles to answer the other puzzles, in which you have to change the symbols round. In this study only 20% of people could figure out \"6 = 6 + 6\" becomes \"6 = 6 = 6\". But the people wearing thinking caps fared much better. The researchers passed an electric current through the brain to reduce the activity of part of the brain called the left anterior temporal lobe and increase the activity of the right. As a result, three times as many people could solve the problem. Professor Allan Synder, director of the Centre for the Mind, said the effect hinged on changing the balance between the two halves of the brain: \"The approach we used can temporarily modulate hemispheric balance to our advantage. \"The effects of stimulation last probably an hour, which is exactly what we wanted, a temporary window that allows us to connect the dots in a novel way.\" There have also been claims that stimulating the brain can improve the ability to learn a language, memory and attentiveness. Dr Roi Cohen Kadosh, from the University of Oxford, has shown that brain stimulation can improve mathematical ability. He said: \"The primary aim is to apply this kind of research to patients with neurodamage or learning difficulties, but then we could look at enhancing abilities.\" He is starting to work with private companies to design a cap that could be used for enhancement. Professor Synder also believes brain boosting headgear can be developed. He told the BBC: \"The thinking cap of the future is not one that helps us to remember facts as the internet has solved that problem, but one that facilitates learning and unlearning mindsets. It's all about being original.\" Dr Chris Chambers, neuroscientist from the University of Cardiff, believes there are problems with the Australian study. He argues that you can prove that stimulation has an effect only in those maths puzzles, not on wider thinking. The cause is also elusive. The electricity could just be making people more awake and alert, he says. When it came to thinking caps, Dr Chambers told the BBC: \"It's science fiction, everything we know about the subject suggests this is many many years away if it even happens at all.\"", "question": "Are we entering the era of the thinking cap - a @placeholder to supercharge our brains ?", "option_0": "device", "option_1": "scheme", "option_2": "response", "option_3": "bid", "option_4": "series", "label": 0}
{"article": "Delhi's relations with Tehran are multi-faceted and complex. The two countries share centuries-old cultural and linguistic links. In modern times, the relationship is more economic and strategic. Tehran was the second biggest supplier of crude oil to India until 2011-12. Iran is also strategically located in the Gulf, and it offers an alternative trade route to Afghanistan and to Central Asia. India is home to the world's second highest Shia population, next only to Iran. Iran's influence over an estimated 45 million Shias in India is regarded as significant.  With Iran emerging after international sanctions, it offers great investment opportunities to Indian companies. But the bilateral ties suffered setbacks following international sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme. As successive Indian governments moved closer to the US, their Iran policy took a back seat, much to the displeasure of the Iranians. Iranians were dismayed when India voted against their country at a vote in the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2009. Then India significantly reduced oil imports from Tehran following US pressure. \"That was a bitter lesson for the Iranians. They understood that India would not take Iran's side on any dispute and India would not sacrifice its relations with the US and the West for Iran,\" says Fatemeh Aman, an Iran-South Asia affairs analyst based in the US. During his first two years at office, Mr Modi focused more on India's immediate neighbourhood and Indian Ocean rim countries. Relations with the United States and the west were given a priority. \"There is very clear sense in India that he has to engage more with Muslim countries in the region, in the extended neighbourhood. Mr Modi has already been to Saudi Arabia, the UAE and planning to visit Qatar. \"The visit to Iran comes as part of the strategy,\" says Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, Senior Fellow for South Asia at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London. When the international sanctions were in place, India could not pay for the oil it had imported from Iran. It still owes $6.5bn in unpaid dues and Delhi is still finding a way to facilitate the payment. Western banks are still reluctant to do business with Iran when some of the US sanctions are still in place. India is aware that China is making inroads into Iran to rebuild the economy devastated by the sanctions. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, visited Iran in January this year to firm up business ties. Beijing is already Iran's largest trading partner. Profile: Narendra Modi With the security situation in Afghanistan deteriorating, India is also looking to find various ways to maintain its foothold in the war-torn nation to counter Pakistani influence. With the land route to Afghanistan through Pakistan unavailable, it's looking at Iran to trade with Afghanistan. India is investing more than $150m to develop Chabahar port in south-eastern Iran. It hopes the port will give a transit route to Afghanistan. In the future, it also wants to bring gas from Central Asia and then transport it to India. The project will also give sea access to Afghanistan. \"From India's perspective, Chabahar port is a gateway to Afghanistan. From Chabahar there is a road which goes all the way to Afghanistan and it will link up with a road which India has already built inside Afghanistan.  In a way, India is ensuring that there could be no exit strategy from Afghanistan,\" says Mr Roy-Chaudhury. Mr Modi plans to visit Kabul in June and he is expected to sign a trilateral trade agreement with Iran and Afghanistan for Chabahar port. During his meeting with the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, Mr Modi would want to assure that India is keen to establish deeper and long-standing ties.

Earlier, every stage at the event was closed after lightning struck ground. Dance act Rudimental were escorted off the main stage mid-set, and had to abandon their planned encore - Feel The Love, with guest vocalist John Newman. \"We're quite upset,\" musician Amir Amor told the BBC, \"but we had a great time anyway\". Metallica's Lars Ulrich was flying into the site by helicopter as the storm descended. \"It was kind of frightening,\" he said. \"When we landed, all the people picking us up were going, 'we didn't expect you were going to fly in this weather'. \"But the pilot didn't say anything about that. We saw the lightning up there. I thought it was pyrotechnics for Arcade Fire.\" The thunderstorm heralded a brief but torrential downpour, and the power cut took BBC coverage off the air. Music resumed on the main stage at 19:00 BST with Lily Allen, who dedicated an expletive-laden song to FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Other performers on Friday included Blondie, who proved so popular it became impossible to enter or leave The Other Stage at lunchtime, and Paolo Nutini, whose soulful ballads were a fitting soundtrack as dusk fell over Somerset. Sophie Ellis-Bextor sneaked some disco into her set at the largely-acoustic Avalon Stage, while the pulsing synthpop of Glaswegian band Chvrches made for a steamy atmosphere in the John Peel tent as fans danced off the downpour. Arcade Fire took to the stage shortly after 22:00 BST, their arrival heralded by a man dressed from head-to-toe in a mirrored suit. Bravely, considering the weather conditions, the 12-piece band were largely dressed in white, but if they were worried about laundry bills, it didn't show. They  threw themselves around the stage, thrashing and spinning as though plagued by a swarm of invisible bees, each member switching instruments between - and often during - songs. As well as guitars, they played steel drums, xylophones and even a hurdy gurdy. Frontman Win Butler made frequent excursions into the audience and, during the song Flashbulb Eyes, plucked a camera from a press photographer and carried it on stage to capture the band's performance. The set list was evenly spread across their four albums, with highlights including No Cars Go, Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels) and Rebellion (Lies). The group's recurring subject matter of suburban despair and alienation might have seemed like an odd fit for Glastonbury's peace and love ethos, but there is an optimism and belief in humanity at the core of their music. Plus, they have really catchy choruses. The band's willingness to embrace all walks of life was displayed on Friday night during the song We Exist - about a teenager whose father struggles to accept his sexuality. As the opening chords rang out, a troupe of transgender and cross-dressing dancers joined the band onstage. \"Every one of us is born special and unique,\" said Butler. \"However you are and however you were born, you're perfect.\" The feel-good atmosphere continued throughout the two-hour set - ending with a mass singalong to the band's signature song, Wake Up. Speaking to the BBC earlier in the day, the band's guitarist Richard Reed-Parry said they had enjoyed soaking up the Glastonbury atmosphere on Friday. \"There's a great feeling coming in,\" he said. \"It's a nice vibe.

One of them is 15, the other 13. \"I have been working in Turkey for two years,\" says Abdurrahman, 15. \"We don't have enough money. I have to pay the rent.\" Their rent is nearly $250 (Â£170) per month. When I ask about his days in Syria, his school and his life then, he says: \"Lessons were hard, but not as much as working. I am getting tired every day.\" Abdurrahman stares at me with his large brown eyes and tells me that he misses playing hide and seek with his friends. The other Syrian boy who works here is Mohammed. He is 13 and works to support his family too. He says he misses drawing pictures with colouring pens. Abdurrahman and Mohammed are only two of the unregistered and illegal workers in the second biggest industry in Turkey, a country that has become a leading supplier of garments to Europe after China and Bangladesh. The overall number of Syrian children working illegally is unclear. However, Turkey did not have a good record on child labour even before nearly 2.5 million Syrian refugees arrived in the country. According to the latest figures, half a million Turkish children are also working in different sectors, despite the fact that child labour is banned under Turkish law. The five-year Syrian civil war has created 4.5 million refugees across the region - half of them children in need of food, education and a home. Although half of the 600,000 Syrian children in Turkey are enrolled in schools, many are obliged to earn money for their families. The UN has warned that a whole generation of Syrian children is at risk. Last month, the Business Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) asked 28 major brands if they were aware of any Syrian children employed by their Turkish suppliers and, if so, their strategies for combating the exploitation of Syrian children and adults. In their answers to the watchdog, retail chain H&M said out of 210 units it was working with in Turkey, they found Syrian children were working in one unit. The company also said it was co-operating with a non-governmental agency (NGO) in Turkey to ensure that education planning was drawn up and implemented. The retailer Next also said it had identified that Syrian children had worked for its Turkish suppliers. The company's strategy for tackling the issue was also praised in the report by BHRRC. On the other hand, representatives of the textile sector in Turkey criticised news agencies and newspapers which had reported the issue, saying that such stories would harm the Turkish economy and discredit Turkish textile manufacturing.

{"article": "Massive adult yellowfins swim together, while juveniles group separately and swim with adult skipjack of a similar size. Schooling confuses predators and makes it less likely that any single fish will fall victim to one. And bigger numbers mean more eyes are on the lookout for a meal. Fishing is the best economic hope for the tiny island states that dot this part of the Pacific. And much like the fish they pull from the ocean, they've learned the benefits of swimming together. The bulk of the fishing in the Pacific is sold by treaty to other countries, with the host nation collecting an access fee for each day of fishing. Since the Pacific island nations started negotiating as a bloc five years ago, they've found themselves in a much better position. Effectively, eight Pacific countries including Kiribati, formed a cartel, banding together to wield their market power to negotiate a better deal, and it's working. Their revenues from fishing rights have increased from $100m (Â£65m) to $430m over the past five years, according to the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency. So how can these tiny states, mere specks on a map of the vast Pacific, wield this kind of market power? In truth, they're not as small as they seem. Every nation's exclusive economic zone spreads roughly 370 kilometres (230 miles) from its shores in every direction. So a country of widely-scattered, tiny atolls can have massive fishing grounds, even if it doesn't have much land. Kiribati's land area is only 810 sq km, roughly equal to the city of New York or about half the size of Greater London, but its exclusive economic zone is bigger than India (about 3.5 million sq km). Together, the small island states control so much ocean that they've enacted a rule forcing their customers to choose between their waters and the open ocean. Most opt for the former. But controlling enough of the resources is no guarantee of an effective cartel. Cartels take a considerable amount of political will and discipline. Members of the most famous one, Opec, often break ranks, and there's some evidence of discord here, too. \"Certainly we encounter more and more where it becomes more difficult to operate as a bloc. The easy wins have been won already,\" says Wez Norris, the deputy director-general of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency. Last year, Kiribati largely opted out of a regional $90m deal with the US, drastically cutting the number of days US boats could fish in its water under the treaty. Kiribati's President Anote Tong says there's a practical element to it. In previous years, they ran out of fishing days allowed under the treaty, and had to buy some from one country in order to give it to another. But Kiribati might also be looking for a better deal. \"All we're saying is we would reduce our contribution of vessel days to the US treaty. If the US boats want to fish in our waters, they can buy direct from us,\" he says. Regardless of whether cartels stick together, national competition and consumer watchdogs take a dim view of them, because they usually jack up prices. Trade commissions or consumer bodies might step in, for example, if supermarket chains or petrol retailers were jointly setting prices or conspiring to drive rivals out of business. Of course, there's no watchdog that can stop co-operation between governments. But the small Pacific states can scarcely be accused of predatory trade practices given how much fishing wealth flows out of the region. The real money is not in selling the raw materials, it is in processing. Some years, Kiribati will keep only 5% of the wealth from its fish, although the average is closer to 10%. President Anote Tong says if every fish caught in the country's waters was processed domestically, the country's gross domestic product would double or triple many times over. \"All the fish is now being taken to Bangkok. Imagine all the jobs it's creating over there, but not here,\" he says. \"So our objective is, and I think it's fair, that we want the processing. We want greater participation in the industry. Not just be the source of the raw material.\" Kiribati is doing something about it. Every Wednesday, longline fishing boats glide across the startling blue lagoon waters and dock at Tarawa, the main island. Workers haul massive yellowfin and bigeye tuna from below the deck, throw them over their shoulders and march up a flight of stairs before lifting them onto the docks. Then, they're loaded into massive ice-filled tubs, and taken down the dock to a processing plant. This facility, run by Kiribati Fish Limited, employs 200 people, in addition to 100 who work on the boats. That's no small achievement in a country where unemployment tops 30%. Still, it faces massive challenges. The same geography that gives these states such large fishing grounds ensures that they're smaller than their competitors and a long way from the markets they serve. \"There's more cost on labour and more cost on freight because the location is very far from the market,\" says Riakaina Teiwaki, who's the firm's assistant general manager. \"This makes the product more expensive.\" Fish processing plants in the Pacific have a patchy record. But Mr Norris of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency is optimistic that there's a future in them. There have been \"a number of failed ventures in the region over the past 30 years.\" he says. \"It's just a matter of learning from mistakes of the past and applying proper scrutiny.\" And Kiribati desperately needs the money. The low-lying atolls that make up this country are among the world's most vulnerable to climate change, and President Tong says this is perhaps the only way for Kiribati to build its resilience.", "question": "As huge @placeholder of tuna cut swiftly across the Western Pacific on a migration course that spans thousands of kilometres , they cluster by size .", "option_0": "arrives", "option_1": "emerged", "option_2": "schools", "option_3": "pictures", "option_4": "consisting", "label": 2}

{"article": "The man, who lives on Merseyside, used the online encyclopaedia to mock the victims of the 1989 Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final. An inquiry was launched in April when it emerged Whitehall computers were used to make the disparaging entries. The edits included the phrase \"Blame Liverpool fans\". The 24-year-old junior administrator, who was born in London but lives in Liverpool, has been dismissed for gross misconduct. His sacking follows an investigation by The Daily Telegraph which identified him through his internet activity. The man altered the Wikipedia page for Hillsborough in 2012, including one entry that parodied the Liverpool fans' anthem \"You'll Never Walk Alone\" by changing it to \"You'll Never Walk Again\". A Commons statement from Cabinet Officer minister Francis Maude said:  \"I was deeply distressed that, at a time when the hearings of the Hillsborough inquests were unfolding, the Civil Service was brought into disrepute by these edits. Profiles of all those who died \"Our position from the very start has been that the amendments made to Wikipedia are sickening. The behaviour is in complete contravention of the Civil Service code and every canon of civilised conduct. It is entirely unacceptable.\" The department had feared the length of time since the amendments, which were made in 2009 and 2012, would make it impossible to identify those responsible. However, Mr Maude said the investigation had not been able to identify the culprit of the 2009 Wikipedia edits, owing to technical obstacles. The minister praised the contribution of journalist Oliver Duggan who broke the story for the Liverpool Echo on 25 April and passed on his research to the Cabinet Office. \"That information has proved extremely helpful and provided a significant investigative lead,\" he said.

{"article": "The seven ministers and about 600 political appointees from the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) will need to resign from their jobs in government in the coming days. The move comes at a crucial time for Ms Rousseff, as she battles for her government's survival in an impeachment process. Next month, Brazil's Congress will start voting on whether to remove her from office. The PMDB exit increases the likelihood of her being removed from power as early as May, which would end the time in power of the leftist Workers' Party after more than 13 years. Brazil tumbles like 'House of Cards' Rousseff faces perfect storm Brazil's bigger threats What's gone wrong? Opposition and government politicians are campaigning hard to muster up numbers in Congress for a vote, likely to be held around 17 April in the lower house of Congress. Ms Rousseff's side needs 172 out of 513 votes to bury the impeachment process. She is accused of using illegal accounting manoeuvres to turn a budget deficit into a surplus last year, but denies wrongdoing. The opposition needs to secure 342 votes to carry the proceedings on to the upper house, where a simple majority would be enough to suspend Ms Rousseff from office. If that happens, Vice-President Michel Temer of the PMDB party would become interim president. As for Ms Rousseff, she would have six months to work on her defence before a final trial later in the year. The PMDB will play a crucial part in how the drama will now unfold. The speakers of both houses of Congress and the vice-president are all from the party, and it has more senators and MPs than any other group. Defining what the PMDB is and what it stands for is a difficult task, even for seasoned political scientists. Brazilian politics are ideologically defined by two groups that have governed the country since 1994: Ms Rousseff's centre-left Workers' Party (PT) and the centre-right opposition Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB). Meanwhile, the centrist PMDB has been part of every governing coalition since 1984 - left, centre and right. Brazil has dozens of political parties and it is virtually impossible for any president to govern without a broad coalition that can secure support in Congress. Having the PMDB on board has been crucial for presidents to get things done. But it comes at a high cost. Last October, as Ms Rousseff needed more support in Congress for her economic reforms, she gave seven ministerial posts to the PMDB, at the expense of her own Workers' Party. But the PMDB is not a uniform, disciplined outfit, and that explains a lot of Brazil's current political crisis. The PMDB is a catch-all organisation with a broad spectrum of political leaders and no clear manifesto. Since last year, its ranks have been split over whether to support or oppose Ms Rousseff's government. The powerful speaker of the lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha, openly opposed the coalition from the start. In fact, he was the one who kicked off the impeachment process last December. On the other hand, some of its most senior members, Mr Temer and the speaker of the Senate, Renan Calheiros, quietly stood by Ms Rousseff. Recent events have dramatically changed the political landscape and undermined support for the Workers' Party. Operation Car Wash, the major police investigation into corruption at state oil giant Petrobras, centred its efforts on former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers' Party's most important political figure and a potential candidate in the 2018 presidential election. Lula was briefly detained for questioning in early March. A few days later, anti-government crowds held one of the largest street demonstrations in history across the country. In a risky political move, Ms Rousseff gave Lula a job in cabinet, angering many, who saw it as an attempt to thwart the course of investigations into his affairs. A judge then released tapes of private phone conversations between Ms Rousseff and Lula, and a court decided to suspend his nomination as minister. Those events took a strong toll on Ms Rousseff's popularity and political support. The impeachment process centres on the question of whether she used illegal accounting manoeuvres or not. But in practical terms, MPs and senators are looking mostly at whether she has the strength and legitimacy to govern Brazil, as the country faces a severe economic crisis as well as a political one. The PMDB was the first major coalition partner to jump ship. It is also the group that stands to gain most should Ms Rousseff be impeached. Mr Temer has reportedly been talking to opposition leaders and working on forming a cabinet. But despite her weakened stance, Ms Rousseff and her Workers' Party still have support from many in Congress and in the streets. There will be a lot to play for in the coming days. April 2016 will be a defining month in Brazil's history.", "question": "The @placeholder that Brazil 's largest party , and coalition partner , is leaving government is a major blow to President Dilma Rousseff .", "option_0": "news", "option_1": "body", "option_2": "announcement", "option_3": "events", "option_4": "organisation", "label": 2}

Bank customers have become accustomed to paying a fee for add-ons to their account, such as insurance. But fee-charging accounts now tend to offer other incentives. These tend to include cashback for opening an account, or discounts at certain retailers. Moneyfacts found that customers with accounts that had a regular management fee paid Â£131 a year on average. However, some customers with subscription-free accounts might actually be worse off, owing to the extra charges when going overdrawn. Moneyfacts looked at the extreme case of a customer who took an unauthorised overdraft for 30 consecutive days in each of the 12 months of the year. Typically they would face charges of Â£918 a year. However, Moneyfacts found that only one in five of all types of current accounts paid interest to customers who kept money in their account. Rachel Springall, of Moneyfacts, said: \"It is clear that the concept of free banking has become a bit of a myth for the majority of standard current account customers. \"The complex nature of current accounts makes it hard to choose the right option upfront, which means that when someone does borrow, the fees are likely to give them a nasty surprise.\" Earlier this month, the Finances Services Consumer Panel (FSCP), a consumer watchdog which advises the City regulator, suggested that a duty of care from banks to their customers should be enshrined in law to prevent further mis-selling scandals.

The sale has raised money to help run the Hwange National Park and also slows the growth of the elephant herd, Zimbabwean officials say.

In a statement it said that the elephants would be \"sentenced to a life of inhuman treatment\". ZCTF chairman Johnny Rodrigues added that the transported elephants were between two-and-a-half and five years old - not old enough to be weaned. The elephants are due to be taken to the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou, southern China, which is home to 20,000 rare animals, according to its website. Zimbabwe's Environment Minister Saviour Kasukuwere defended the sale to Bloomberg news agency, saying that \"there is nothing irregular with this export, this is part of elephant conservation\". There have been concerns that Zimbabwe's growing elephant population was threatening the vegetation in the Hwange National Park and damaging the crops of nearby human settlements.

{"article": "The severing was described as unprecedented and repairs would be \"extremely tricky\" and take up to three weeks. While there were no major problems, having just a single connection out of the islands was described as \"risky\". It happened on Monday evening with one cable being cut after another with connections was redirected through France. The positions of the cables are clearly marked on maps, charts and navigation systems so ships know where they are and do not drop their anchors. This includes clear warnings of banned areas where ships are not allowed to drop anchor. A spokesman for telecoms firm JT said if they were not marked you could see this happening more often. Professor Jim Norton, an expert in the undersea network, said people had to plan on losing cables. While they allow for large amounts of data to be shared, they can be vulnerable. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: \"These navigational charts are appropriate to the voyages they intend undertaking and show all navigational information including the position of sea-bed cables. \"During a storm it is possible that a ship may drag its anchor along the sea bed and it is possible for a vessel to unintentionally cause damage to seabed cabling. \"A prudent ship's master would try to avoid the chances of this ever happening by choosing an appropriate place to anchor and being prepared to raise the anchor and steam away from the area of risk in the case of bad weather.\" JT has four cables, so the islands remain connected when something like this happens, something the company says has been invaluable to maintain its services. There are other undersea cables that can carry telecom traffic by company Sure, along with Guernsey and Jersey Electricity and private businesses like banks. Richard Moore, from Sure, said: \"Despite numerous breakages since the first fibre-optic cable was laid to the islands in 1989, the reliability of our telecoms operators is in real terms, impeccable.\" He added that networks operated by internet service providers were designed so if there is a problem with one cable, data can be sent through another cable. JT says the cables are mostly buried, but obviously, some sections can not be, depending on the seabed they run over. The company says that does not mean the broken cables weren't buried as even if you put them under the seabed a dragging anchor would still break them. Until the teams get down to the breaks, they will not know exactly what the situation was in this case. Richard Moore, from Sure, said the islands could not develop economically in isolation, so had to rely on outside communication links. He said the islands were well protected so the risk of everything going at once was very small. He said internet-enabled applications were usually designed to cope with an unstable connection for a short-term loss would not have a big impact. Mr Moore said: \"Software designers have long needed to consider the impact that intermittent wi-fi signal, or the loss of mobile networks, might have on transactions processed by their app.\" He said cloud companies should consider using multiple service providers in a number of locations to reduce the risk of services stopping.", "question": "A ship dragging its anchor cut three undersea internet cables connecting the Channel Islands to the UK this week .

But he warned that progress against piracy was fragile and still reversible. The statistics show a dramatic reduction in pirate attacks off Somalia. In 2011, according to EU Navfor Somalia, there were 151 verified attacks on sizable ships, with 25 vessels being successfully pirated. So far this year, the number of attacks has shrunk to 31, with just five ships captured, the last one in May. \"October and November would normally be two of the busiest months for maritime piracy as they come between the two monsoon seasons,\" said Admiral Potts, \"but this year they have been surprisingly quiet.\" He puts the drop in piracy down to four factors: On 15 May, EU Navfor conducted their first and only raid on a Somali pirates' land base. It lasted just a few minutes, with a helicopter crew launching from a ship just offshore and raking beached and unmanned pirate speedboats - known as \"skiffs\" - with machine-gun fire. Fuel stores and other equipment were also fired on, but EU Navfor says there were no casualties on either side and there were no European \"boots on the ground\". \"Surveillance by our reconnaissance aircraft shows this had a significant psychological effect,\" said Admiral Potts. Somali pirates are probably now under more pressure than at any time in the last five years and the risk-reward ratio for putting to sea and raiding commercial shipping is now far less favourable than it used to be. But Admiral Potts is under no illusion that the problem is already solved and knows it could still return. In fact, there have been signs of renewed activity this week. As ever, the source of the problem is on land, and until Somalia can reach a certain level of stability and prosperity, the spectre of piracy is likely to hover over its coast for years to come.", "question": "The business model that has underpinned maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia for the past few years has effectively been broken , according to the Operation Commander of the European Union Naval Force ( EU Navfor ) in the @placeholder , Rear Admiral Duncan Potts .", "option_0": "region", "option_1": "country", "option_2": "county", "option_3": "world", "option_4": "capital", "label": 0}

{"article": "This nonsense is still being purveyed about four days being the way forward for Test cricket - of course it isn't. This is another fine example of why you need five days in a Test match. You let the match take its proper course - you don't cram overs in - and you often get a good result and occasionally a match like this, which has been absolutely brilliant. Bangladesh are still seeking their first Test win against England but in their own country they are a force to be reckoned with, playing an exciting brand of cricket in conditions that the visitors are often not familiar with. They don't play enough Test matches of course, this was their first match since July 2015. They play a lot of one-day cricket and that's rather reflected in the way they go about their game. But it's exciting, it's fresh and they came very close indeed to claiming their biggest scalp, having previously only beaten Zimbabwe and a far below strength West Indies. The fans love the game here but unfortunately in the past it has not been part of the culture to come and watch Test cricket. They all pile in for one-day cricket but Test cricket is usually played when people are working, though they are all following it on the television and the radio. The more Test cricket they play, they will hopefully be able to get more people into the ground but it's not easy here. It's not a rich country, people have to go to work and can't just take time off. Make no mistake, they all love their cricket. It's tempting to say this is just a place to bowl spinners but Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes were vital for England and showed that the quicker bowlers can have an influential role here. They are very fit and they are challenging in any conditions. These days, bowlers are so skilled at reverse swing and these are ideal conditions for that, very dry, quite abrasive pitch and the ball does get roughed up quite quickly. They are very adept at using that to make the ball swing, which is a 25-year-old phenomenon now since Pakistan's Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram first demonstrated it. The England seamers are important because they give captain Alastair Cook control. Looking ahead to the next game in Dhaka starting on Friday, that's an area that he will still be concerned about. His spinners just don't get a grip of the game in the way that Test quality spinners should do. I would be surprised if England play the same team. They will have a think about Surrey's uncapped left-arm spinner Zafar Ansari to provide another option - whether they play him in place of a seamer or use him as a batsman/spinner and drop Gary Ballance perhaps, who made only 10 runs in the match. If you look at the way Cook went straight for seam bowlers on the final day when Bangladesh only needed 33 more runs, he felt his best chance of winning the match was through his quick bowlers. We know the issue about England's spinners. That's why they have got Gareth Batty and he bowled well in the second innings, taking 3-65 from 17 overs. Cook could have bowled him on the final morning, he probably would have been the next one to bowl if England hadn't taken a wicket. The captain knows England are still vulnerable in that department and the opponents know that as well. I imagine that the pitch for the second Test in Dhaka, which might have been flat had Bangladesh won here, will probably suit the spinners again and hopefully we'll get another interesting game. The ball turned consistently and clearly unsettled the batsmen but wasn't unplayable and it made for a really good spectacle. There were a record 26 reviews and it underlines the difficulties for umpires when there is a lot of spin bowling going on and batsmen are getting on to the front foot. The tradition has always been to give the benefit of the doubt to the batsman in borderline decisions, but there is no benefit of the doubt with DRS. Just getting on the front foot against the spinner when the ball hits you on the pad is no escape any more, the computer gives you out. All the practice and preparation has to be a good thing ahead of the challenge awaiting in India. Let's hope we get a similar pitch in Dhaka, with more spin and bite, not a flat, horrible surface like we see in the UAE. If England come through and win 2-0 that should set them up for the five-match series in India which starts on 9 November. They will be pleased with the way they fought, but they've got to get more runs out of their top order batsmen and their spinners have still got some work to do.

{"article": "His lawyer admitted he was wrong to ignore an anti-corruption watchdog's report to pay back money spent on features such as a swimming pool. The opposition brought the case, hoping it will open the way for impeachment proceedings against the president. Thousands of people protested outside court, shouting \"Zuma must fall\". Police put up a strong show of force, as the protesters, led by Julius Malema's left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), marched to the court in the main city, Johannesburg. Latest updates from court and protests How Zuma's home has grown The protest was against \"corruption and cronyism\" in government, the EFF said. The main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) also organised its own demonstration. The governing African National Congress (ANC) denounced the marches as a \"political exercise\". The opposition parties want the Constitutional Court to rule that Mr Zuma flouted the constitution by ignoring a 2014 report by the anti-corruption watchdog, known as the Public Protector, that he should repay the money, as he had \"unduly benefited\" from the upgrade. At the time, the police minister defended the expenditure as necessary security upgrades, saying the swimming pool was, in fact, a fire pool that could be used in the event a fire broke out at the residence in Mr Zuma's home village of Nkandla. An amphitheatre, cattle enclosure and chicken run were also built. Mr Zuma's lawyer Jeremy Gauntlett conceded in court that the report was \"binding\" on the president, and he was prepared to repay the money within 90 days. However, he denied that Mr Zuma had violated the constitution. The admission by Mr Zuma's lawyer was shocking: The president was legally bound to accept the findings of the Public Protector's report, entitled Secure in Comfort. This was a massive U-turn, as Mr Zuma had until now argued that the report contained mere recommendations, lacking the status of a court order. Looking at Mr Malema, I could only conclude that he was rubbing his hands with glee as the drama unfolded in court. The EFF now smells blood - it hopes South Africa's highest court will go as far as to rule that the president breached the constitution and therefore violated his oath of office. The opposition would then no doubt demand the president's impeachment. For now, Police Minister Nathi Nhleko's position is most tenuous. He was at the forefront of the campaign to rubbish the Public Protector's report. It is difficult to see how he can remain in the post. The hashtag #PayBackTheMoney, mirroring the slogan used by EFF members to taunt the president, has been trending in South Africa: The saga has become a major political scandal, at one point sparking scuffles inside parliament. EFF lawyer Wim Trengrove told the court the president had defied the Public Protector to unlawfully \"enrich himself\", South Africa's private News24 website reports. \"His conduct at the time and response to the report was in violation of the constitution,\" Mr Trengrove is quoted as telling the judges. The case comes at a difficult time for Mr Zuma, who has also been under fire over his handling of the finance ministry, after he sacked two ministers in a week last year. Many South Africans also accuse his government of not doing enough to tackle corruption and poverty.", "question": "South Africa 's President Jacob Zuma has made a U - turn in court over his refusal to repay some of the $ 23 m ( Â£15 m ) of @placeholder money used to upgrade his home .", "option_0": "misusing", "option_1": "state", "option_2": "assisting", "option_3": "leaking", "option_4": "causing", "label": 1}
{"article": "These are some of the answers I'm given to the question of what makes a good chief executive. Since the World Economic Forum is full of them (good, bad and ugly), I reckon it's a good place to ask. \"Don't believe your own brilliance\" says Arne Sorenson, chief executive of Marriot Hotels and the first non-Marriott to be entrusted with leading the company in its 88-year history. \"You need to be curious and you need to be doing more listening than talking.\" \"It's possible to glorify the position of CEOâ€¦ it's important that they should not be the only one making the decisions. Nobody is that brilliant.\" You need a certain amount of rebellion within the team, he says in a crushed corner of the congress centre in Davos. And if you don't, you're doomed. He also mentions the need to be authentic. Surprising, perhaps - but apparently he's not alone in thinking that's important. Tim Morris, professor of management studies at Oxford University, was part of a team that carried out a study into the expectations of today's CEO. They interviewed more than 150 chief executives about their job and although they had specifically avoided the word authentic, because they thought of it as too much of a buzz-word, it kept being brought up by the bosses themselves. \"It's clearly important to them,\" says Prof Morris. \"Chief executives feel that they can't get people behind them unless they're authentic.\" \"The traditional way of thinking about the good leader would be that they deliver for the shareholder and they survive because they deliver profits and keep people happy. \"But, for the people we interviewed, the job of chief executive was much more complicated than that.\" But, I'm wondering, isn't it authentic to deliver profits? Isn't that what the job of CEO is? Apparently not any more. According to Oxford University's research, chief executives nowadays feel that they have to be more approachable, engaged, and caring. Or, as one described it, the Chief Emotional Officer. And Prof Morris believes there won't be a return to the 'old-style' chief executive. Leah Busque is relatively new to the business of being the boss. In 2008, she went from being a software engineer at IBM to setting up and running the company TaskRabbit. New to the UK, the American website helps people find someone in their area to do a job for them, and now has about 50 employees. She says she didn't have or need any training in leadership, but that she thinks the key is that she is self-aware enough to know when to bring in other people to fill in the gaps in her knowledge. And it sounds like she's feeling the pressure to be more human. \"Showing vulnerability sometimes as a CEO is not a bad thing, but it's not always easyâ€¦ CEOs don't like to be vulnerable, and show their weaknesses. Actually for me, it's something I have to really think about and really force myself to do.\" Establishing exactly how you do that is tricky. It's possible to try too hard. \"The worst thing you can do is go on an authenticity course\", says Prof Morris. \"You need to be consistent with your values, your purpose, with what you want to do and why.\" Prof Morris says the power of social media means that it's impossible to switch off and dealing with that required much more subtlety than in the past. He says there's a feeling among the chief executives they interviewed that as soon as they wake up they're aware of their responsibility. \"You can't just say sorry that's not my problem, I'll deal with it on Monday morning. There's a sense that it's all-consuming.\" But he said a trait many of the executives had was an ability to shut the door on a decision after having made it. The other factor that the CEO report highlights is how there is increasingly a global standard to the job. The answers and expectations in Japan and Korea, were not significantly different to those in the US or Europe. And indeed the clearest answer I got on what makes a good chief executive came from Sim Tshabalala, Co-CEO of Standard Bank, one of Africa's largest. \"It's about knowing your industry but having the ability to lead people who know more than you,\" he says.", "question": "@placeholder , doubt and the ability to make mistakes .", "option_0": "culture", "option_1": "detect", "option_2": "loads", "option_3": "Humility", "option_4": "nowadays", "label": 3}
{"article": "Saturday night at Twickenham was all that and more. Breathless chaos, impossible composure.  A moment of brilliance, a litany of stupidity. Arguably the biggest and best win Wales have ever pulled off on foreign soil, indisputably the most devastating defeat of Stuart Lancaster's England regime. How did Wales snatch it? In any normal victory over England - if there were such a thing - there would be those who couldn't care. All that matters is the win. Except this time the style and circumstance will be essential to the celebration. Ten points down at half-time, a scrum disintegrating, a line-out malfunctioning. Half a team out injured before the night had begun, their replacements succumbing the same way. England in charge, kicking their points, holding their line. Some of it sprung from a change in tactics. Keep the ball in play. Take the set-piece out of the equation. A lot of it came down to the dead-eyed kicking of Dan Biggar. Seven penalties kicked for the posts, seven successful. No Welshman has ever scored as many in a World Cup contest as his unblemished 23. With the deficit still seven points and less than 10 minutes remaining, in came the individual inspiration - Lloyd Williams, disappearing down a white-shirted cul-de-sac on the left wing, kicking cross-field with the same elan and accuracy as Didier Camberabero on this same turf 24 years ago to send Gareth Davies away for the critical try. With the score locked at 25-25, a weary yet indefatigable Biggar nailed a monstrous penalty from almost halfway to complete the comeback. All that, and then belief, and guts, and fitness, and fight. There were reasons everywhere for Wales to accept defeat. They would not take them. It still should not have been enough. This was a match won in astonishing fashion but also lost in the way that can haunt teams and finish coaches. Had you missed the entire match then the look on Lancaster's face afterwards would have told you everything you needed to know. This was the doomsday scenario for his side, a win over Australia now the only thing that stands between them and unwanted infamy as the first World Cup hosts in history to go out of their own tournament in the group stages. It was also a collective failure of strategy, a second-half brain freeze that manifested itself in repeated penalties for exactly the same breakdown offence and came to a head in the decision, three minutes from time, to kick for the corner rather than take on the three points that would have rescued at least a draw. For all the talk about the coach's controversial team selection, this was a match decided elsewhere. Owen Farrell was excellent, banging over all five of his penalties, adding a somewhat wobbly drop-goal and a simpler conversion. Sam Burgess bashed and crashed and slammed a little too. Just before half-time, England led 16-6. They were dominant in the scrum, all over every line-out, winning quick ball and creating space out wide as their ball-carriers sucked in defenders. Ben Youngs was firing, Mike Brown scorching a trail. Just after half-time they still led 19-9. With half an hour to go they had it held at 22-12. So where did it go? In the head and in the hands. At ruck after ruck an Englishman would transgress, the whistle of Jerome Garces would trill and Biggar's boot made another dent in their lead. England missed 17 tackles and conceded eight turnovers. Too often in a disintegrating second half they kicked possession aimlessly away. More critical were the 12 penalties, so many for the same offence. Why not realise? Why not adapt? So much else that England had done was based on solid pragmatism: kick for territory, pick up points when deep in opposition territory, keep the defensive line-speed high and door tightly shut. They could still have rescued it. A draw would have kept this most open of groups in the tantalising balance. Farrell had been faultless. So why gamble on something more? Captain Chris Robshaw has been here before. With time running out against South Africa in the autumn of 2012 he instructed Farrell take a penalty that took his side to within a point, rather than going to the corner. England mangled the re-start, ran out time and lost the match. Three years on he went the other way - red rather than black, twist rather than stick - and found the result the same. Lancaster offered him precious little protection afterwards. He had been screaming from the bench to take the points that would have levelled it. He may be screaming in his sleep for long dark nights to come. For all he has done with England, for all the dedication and thought he has put into his four years and the broken bridges he has mended between the country's elite players and its long-suffering support, it may all be crashing down around him. Sides have come back from calamitous defeats in the group stages before to flourish again at World Cups. Four years ago France were embarrassed by Tonga but went on to reach the final and be within a kick of winning the thing. Eight years ago England were blitzed 36-0 by South Africa yet fought back to somehow meet the same opponents again in the final. Neither had to beat a side as accomplished as the Wallabies just to make it into the knockout stages. Lancaster's team, in every Six Nations and every autumn series, has failed at least one big test. The wriggle-room has now gone. Another now-characteristic failure and they will be gone. Quite what happens to Wales next is another matter. With Scott Williams, Liam Williams and Hallam Amos added to an injury-list that already included two props, a winger, a first-choice scrum-half and a Lions full-back and centre, and a bench so bare that they finished this match with a wing at centre, a scrum-half on wing and a patched-up fly-half at full-back, this victory has come at a cruel price. That is for another night and another morning. As midnight passed to the sounds of Hymns and Arias being sung from the stadium bars and early morning arrived to men in red dancing down the dark streets of south-west London, it was all about one match: a win like no other, a night to never forget.", "question": "Sometimes there are games so gripping that hype is left looking lightweight .

{"article": "It's probably fitting, then, that the responses to the death of the man who founded conservative media behemoth Fox News have been sharply divided along partisan lines. He was a \"monster\" who poisoned American society and made people \"dumber and angrier\". Or he was a \"great American patriot\" and a \"media genius\". One man, two decidedly different pictures in one country with two decidedly different outlooks on the world. Much has been written recently about the fracturing of US culture; of how Americans are withdrawing to their own bubbles, where they are fed news and entertainment that caters to their political and social predispositions. Over the course of the past two decades, Ailes built Fox News into one of the biggest bubbles of all. In 1996, when Ailes was hired by Fox head Rupert Murdoch to start his new network, CNN dominated the cable news world. Its style was not too unlike the network evening news formats that had become a way of life in America since the dawn of television, from Walter Cronkite to Tom Brokaw. Authoritative, purportedly unbiased television presenters read the news and introduced stories, day and night, week after week. A few talks shows dotted the schedule. Crossfire and Capital Gang had politicians and pundits who exchanged barbs, and Larry King offered a safe space for major public figures to get their message out. CNN, however, styled itself as a neutral forum. Ailes took cable news and gave it a partisan edge. The long-time Republican operative, who worked for Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush, fashioned the television news format into an ideological tool - a megaphone or a cudgel, depending on one's perspective. His network's nightly line-ups dispensed with the appearance of even-handedness and offered conservative red meat - which the audiences devoured in record numbers. Ailes successfully concluded that much of the American public didn't want information from their television news, they wanted confirmation. It's impossible to separate Ailes, who for decades was perhaps the most powerful man in US media, from his precipitous downfall, of course. He was accused of being a serial sexual harasser who abused his position of influence to demean and degrade the women around him. More than 25 women came forward to accuse him of a range of predatory behaviour, and Fox Corporation had to pay millions of dollars in legal settlements. If Ailes built a news empire unlike any before it, like all empires there is a peak followed by eventual decline. His network has been beset by a wave of crises. Many of its top talents have departed - including Megyn Kelly, who wrote a book that included details of Ailes's misdeeds. Bill O'Reilly, the highest-rated Fox News personality, was recently deposed in his own sexual harassment scandal. Beyond the accusations that it has become a toxic environment for some of its employees, Fox News has found itself adrift in the Donald Trump era. The sunny picture it paints of the Republican president has often seemed woefully out of step with the daily drumbeat of crises wracking the White House. If the Trump presidency turns into a sinking ship, Fox News is poised to be the orchestra that plays Nearer My God to Thee until the bitter end. This week, when James Comey's memo-writing habits and the details of Mr Trump's conversations with Russians in the Oval Office were sending shockwaves through Washington, Fox evening hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity were focusing on Hillary Clinton's email server and a bogus conspiracy theory about a Democratic staffer who was murdered last year. Even viewership ratings, which Fox News once dominated, have lately shown signs of weakness, as left-leaning MSNBC has frequently posted better numbers during the evening hours over the last few weeks. With Ailes gone, Fox News' future is far from certain. Murdoch recently toured the networks New York headquarters and unveiled plans for a massive structural renovation. A similar programming overhaul could eventual reshape much of what Ailes built.

{"article": "Many in Europe see elements in the Trump administration as having an in-built antipathy towards multilateral  institutions. There were also fears about certain officials' closeness to Moscow - a worry that the US might seek a strategic dialogue with Russia over Europeans' heads. Accordingly, the resignation of the president's controversial National Security Adviser Michael Flynn will not prompt many tears in Europe. America's European allies will, though, at least to some extent, have been reassured by the subsequent noises that have come out of Washington. But they will want to hear direct reassurance from Gen James Mattis - Mr Trump's new defence secretary - that the alliance retains its centrality in US security thinking. They will also want confirmed that all of the steps that the Obama administration took to reinforce deterrence in Europe - the deployment of additional combat brigades and an intensive series of exercises -  will continue under the new man in the White House. Of course Gen Mattis will come with some messages of his own. President Trump - indeed the US Congress - wants to see the European allies shoulder more of the cost of their own defence. Washington has shown that it is willing to stump up troops and equipment, but while collective Nato expenditure is rising, too many Nato governments have been sluggish in bringing their expenditure up to the agreed target of 2% of GDP. According to the latest Nato figures only five allies, Estonia, Greece, Poland, the UK and the United States met or exceeded the 2% benchmark in 2016. The demand from Washington that its allies spend more on their collective defence has been a consistent one over recent years. As a former Nato commander, Gen Mattis knows the alliance well and he has heard all of the excuses before. He will deliver the familiar message with more punch and with a clear implication that this time the US administration expects to see prompt action. Gen Mattis also wants to see Nato become more agile and better at decision-making especially at times of crisis. Washington wants to see the alliance playing a greater role in international efforts to defeat terror and to help prop up failing states. This is a difficult area which causes divisions among the alliance's European members as much as between European capitals and Washington. Iraq - where Nato has already agreed to conduct a small amount of training - could become a test case. The Americans are already thinking about what will happen after Mosul is fully re-captured. As the situation on the ground transitions from all-out war-fighting, there will be a continuing need to build Iraqi capabilities. Here there are lots of things that the US believes Nato countries could do - training for border patrolling, instituting defence reforms and so on. So far the response among allies to the small-scale effort in Iraq has been, shall we say, limited. As far as Washington is concerned, Nato countries don't just need to spend more - they need to significantly enhance their capabilities and be relevant to the sort of real-world tasks in which the US wants its partners to be engaged. Nato's response to a more assertive Russia is all very well but it threatens to open up fissures between northern and eastern allies, on the one hand, who directly face Russia's modernising forces and countries on Nato's Mediterranean flank, on the other, who confront a very different set of challenges. As the paroxysms in Syria and Libya have shown, the migrant or refugee crisis has repercussions throughout the Middle East and much of Europe. At this meeting, Nato ministers want to apply a small corrective to enhance the focus on threats from the south. It's a modest start - a small command hub at the joint forces headquarters in Naples whose job will be to explore what Nato can contribute to dealing with the complex security challenges on its southern flank. But as well as a demand for a more dynamic Nato agenda the US is eager to reassure its allies. A senior US Congressional delegation is visiting the Nato headquarters this week. The Nato meeting is followed by Europe's premier annual security event - the Munich conference - after which the US vice-president himself will also be stopping by at Nato. It is all something of a curtain-raiser for the US president's own first visit to the alliance which will take place in late May. That looks set to be a fairly brief event - little more than a lunch - in Nato's brand new headquarters building, which inconveniently will not be finished in time for the summit. By then it is hoped that Mr Trump will have fully made his peace with Nato. If not, a reduced scale summit in an unfinished building holds risks as well as opportunities. The headline writers could have a field day. The hope is that this Nato ministerial meeting will set the course for more harmonious relations between the alliance and its most important, albeit mercurial member.", "question": "This meeting of Nato defence ministers is the first formal alliance get - together since the arrival of the Trump administration in Washington .

The American homeland has not been attacked again since 9/11, the sense of possibility, of vulnerability, the overwhelming need for security has not gone away. But some things have changed. Today may have evoked memories of a righteous patriotic fervour to deal with those who threaten the country and that desire does still exist but the enthusiasm to reshape the destiny of other countries to make Americans safer has largely disappeared. All of the victims' names were read out amid tears, the five-hour reading punctuated by the solemn silences, and music. Bagpipers opened the gathering, the Brooklyn Youth Chorus sang the national anthem, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma performed, and Paul Simon played his classic song The Sounds Of Silence. Mourners streamed into the newly opened memorial, which has two reflecting pools, each almost an acre in size, in the footprints of the twin towers. They placed pictures and flowers beside names etched in bronze. Grown men and women sobbed in grief over the inscriptions. Behind the memorial could be seen the gleaming bulk of One World Trade Center, now three-quarters completed. Mr Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended ceremonies in New York, Pennsylvania and at the Pentagon. At Ground Zero he joined his predecessor, George W Bush, to visit the memorial. With bowed heads, they touched inscriptions. From New York, the Obamas travelled to the field on Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where the fourth plane was forced down by passengers who fought back. The couple laid a wreath of white flowers at a new marble memorial to the 40 passengers and crew of the lost plane, before moving on to the Pentagon, outside Washington DC, where another wreath was laid. In New York, metal barriers were erected on roads near Ground Zero, while police in New York and Washington are stopping and searching large vehicles entering bridges and tunnels. The CIA received a warning last week that al-Qaeda might have sent attackers, some of them possibly US citizens, to bomb one of the cities. The warning was described by officials as \"credible but unconfirmed\". In an earlier speech at the Pentagon, Vice-President Joe Biden praised the US soldiers who had killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan in May of this year. NEW YORK PENTAGON SHANKSVILLE TOTAL KILLED: 2,976 In pictures: US flag tributes A \"new generation of patriots\" were galvanised by 9/11, he told a military audience. \"We will not stop - you will not stop - until al-Qaeda is disrupted, dismantled and, ultimately, defeated.\" Sunday's ceremonies began at the US embassy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, where the flag was lowered to half-mast to remember those who died 10 years ago, as well as those who have died since. A piece of the twin towers is buried underneath the flag pole. US forces were sent to Afghanistan to oust the Taliban from power after they had given sanctuary to al-Qaeda. Overnight, insurgents attacked US bases in Bagram and Wardak, injuring about 80 US troops and killing two Afghan civilians, officials say.

{"article": "Former SDLP leader Mark Durkan claims they are now being \"played like a joker\". It is one of the kinder descriptions applied to the DUP's decision to use the petition to block an assembly motion this week that, among other things, accused the Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland of misleading the institutions. An \"abuse\"; \"political chicanery\" and \"farce\" are among the charges made by the DUP's political opponents. But they are not the only party to have used the mechanism. Sinn FÃ©in tried, and narrowly failed, to use a petition of concern to block Jim Allister's special adviser (Spad) bill in the assembly. The legislation stops former prisoners with serious convictions becoming a special political adviser at Stormont. The SDLP's decision not to sign the petition meant Sinn FÃ©in had only the signatures of its 29 MLAs - one short of the 30 required. The DUP, however, with 38 MLAs, have no such worries and have been using the measure liberally recently to defeat anything from a vote calling for the introduction of gay marriage in Northern Ireland to amendments to the Planning Bill. Any vote taken by the assembly can be made dependent on cross-community support if a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a given community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions. Since the restoration of devolution in 1998, the device has been used a total of 63 times - more than half of those were in the past two years. Unionists, mainly the DUP, have accounted for 37 petitions of concern. In the most recent assembly term, petitions of concern were used 18 times, compared with just six in 2007/2008, the year devolution was restored. So what is going on? According to Mr Durkan, the assembly's standing orders need to be amended to more accurately reflect the 1998 Good Friday Agreement itself, because the measures are being used \"as defensive, pre-emptive and prescriptive vetoes\". The former SDLP leader said: \"The petition of concern facility was put into the agreement to safeguard communal sensitivities and specifically to protect equality and human rights considerations. \"It was not proposed or envisaged as a tool to protect any minister from due accountability - not least when there are issues on probity in public finances or propriety of ministerial conduct. \"Paragraphs 11 to 13 of the agreement show that the petition of concern was not meant to be played like a joker, as a reflex veto to frustrate any valid proposal. \"Instead, it was meant to trigger a process whereby equality and human rights concerns could be assessed and addressed, by a specially appointed committee of the assembly taking evidence and reporting on those very issues. \"Unfortunately, the assembly standing orders do not actually reflect the carefully calibrated provision in the agreement itself. The 1998 Act says that the assembly standing orders should make provision for what is laid down in those three paragraphs of the agreement.\" Mr Durkan added: \"I have made the point several times before and do so again that the standing orders need to be corrected in accordance with the agreement and the 1998 Act. \"The argument can also be made, and I made it at the time, that the 1998 Act could have been more explicit in providing for the procedure intended.\" The Alliance MP Naomi Long has asked Secretary of State Theresa Villiers to intervene by using the Northern Ireland Miscellaneous Provisions Bill currently making its way through Westminster to instead implement a weighted majority voting system, which would not allow any single party to \"over-ride the wishes of the assembly as a whole\". \"The petition of concern was designed to offer protection to minorities within the assembly, where decisions of a sensitive nature risked being imposed upon them against their will,\" Ms Long said. \"Its use in this case to protect the interest of one party in circumstances where there is widespread and cross-community support for a motion is a clear abuse of the mechanism and makes a strong case for urgent reform,\" she added. The DUP rejects the criticism but has said the party is open to change. A DUP spokesman told the BBC: \"The use of a petition of concern in a motion calling for an inquiry that has already been established appears to have caused a greater outcry than when its use blocked an amendment to the Justice Bill, that would have prevented abortions being performed by private clinics. \"Hopefully, those who have apparently been so outraged by the use of a mechanism they negotiated and supported in 1998 will be equally as forthright in their support for reform of the Stormont structures, which the DUP has supported for over a decade now.\" Just last week, the cross-party assembly and executive review committee decided \"further detailed work\" needed to be carried out on petitions of concern. After the events of this week, many will see that work as more urgent than ever. Of course, if the DUP, or any other party, does not like any proposed changes they can always block them - with a petition of concern.", "question": "They were designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont 's fledgling power - @placeholder assembly , but now petitions of concern are themselves becoming a matter of concern .", "option_0": "backed", "option_1": "wing", "option_2": "controlled", "option_3": "style", "option_4": "sharing", "label": 4}

Among the ideas discussed at a meeting on Wednesday were cutting the speed limit from 70mph and making it a three-lane carriageway. Highways England said it always worked to identify safety improvements. Recent figures revealed the A34, which runs between Hampshire and Oxfordshire, was closed more than once a month last year because of accidents involving fatalities or serious injuries.

{"article": "Patrick Collins, of Lower Nassau Street, Londonderry, was reported to police on 1 August 2016.

When examined by a vet, it was noted that the puppy's heart rate was slow, it had cuts on its paws and there were fears it would not survive, but it did eventually recover. On 2 August, Collins was interviewed and said he did not believe he had ill-treated the dog in any way. He then became abusive to police officers and accused them of beating the dog. He later admitted two counts of animal cruelty. Collins's defence solicitor said it was quite clear from the probation report that he now accepted his wrongdoing. The lawyer said that, at the time it happened, his client was \"hardly able to look after himself, never mind an animal\".

{"article": "The Institute of Directors (IoD) surveyed 1,000 of its members and found that a quarter planned to freeze recruitment.

However, at the weekend, Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at Netwealth and a former adviser to Boris Johnson, said that even though there was short-term uncertainty, in the long-term Britain would be better positioned within the global economy. He believed that the UK was gaining control of its own destiny as it distanced itself from stifling EU regulations. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, told the BBC's Today programme: \"Business leaders  are very, very concerned. Nearly half of them expect the other member states to punish Britain.\" Mr Walker said he did not think those that voted for Brexit realised they were voting \"for constitutional and economic chaos\", but he added half his members did think they could keep going. \"There's no point crying over spilt milk. Over time we must not lose faith in business to recover, but it was always going to be a shock with a loss of jobs and economic growth for quite a long time and it looks as though it will permeate through the whole of British business.\" Mr Walker also told prospective leaders of the Conservative party: \"Businesses have a clear message to those who may wish to replace David Cameron as prime minister: during the referendum campaign we were promised an open and outward-looking country after Brexit, now it must be delivered.\" On Sunday, the Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who campaigned to remain in the EU, said \"It is essential that we protect our access to the single market. Whether we like it or not our economy over 40 years has become shaped by that access, and to lose that access would be catastrophic. \"As we sit here I believe that the flow of foreign direct investment to the UK has all but dried up, while international businesses wait to see how this question is to be resolved. \" On Monday, airline Easyjet and estate agent Foxtons both warned of the impact of the vote to leave the EU on their business. Easyjet said the vote meant \"additional economic and consumer uncertainty is likely this summer\" and it expected revenues to fall as a result.

{"article": "When I was asked to appear for Yakub Memon, I had no hesitation in accepting. I fundamentally believe that the death penalty is flawed, and is a practice that should be abolished. India's constitution envisages that all people, citizens and non-citizens, have a fundamental right to ensure that their life will not be deprived unless through procedure established by law. The Supreme Court has earlier held that this procedure must be fair, just and reasonable. In cases relating to a death sentence in particular, all courts are required to scrutinise whether procedure established by law has been followed or not. This is not a mere technicality. Fundamental rights are only protected by procedure all over the world. Indeed, it is the dividing line between life and death. In Yakub Memon's case, the procedure laid down by law was not followed. First, the procedure requires that before a death warrant is issued, the lawyers of the person on death row must be heard. It also requires that there should be a reasonable gap between the issuing of the death warrant and the date of the execution. As both these steps were not followed, we felt we had a good case. However, the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court rejected that argument on the afternoon of 29 July. The law also gives a person on death row the right to file a mercy petition to the governor or the president. This has now been held to be a constitutional right. More importantly if the mercy petition is rejected, he must get a minimum of 14 days, \"to prepare himself mentally for the execution, to make his peace with God, prepare his will and settle other earthly affairs, to have a final meeting with familyâ€¦ and the right to avail of judicial remedies\". Decoded, this means that he has the right to challenge the rejection of his mercy petition until his last breath. It is the duty of every lawyer to do their best for their client, and especially so in a death penalty case. When we filed a fresh petition on behalf of Yakub Memon, in the late evening of 29 July, we felt again, that we had a strong case. This is when the Supreme Court assembled in open court at 4am. Unfortunately, the court again disagreed with us on the grounds that Memon's brother had filed an earlier mercy petition that had been rejected. However, this did not consider the fact that rules for mercy petitions provided for the prisoner on death row to file a fresh mercy petition on new grounds. That was what Memon did when he filed his mercy petition through the jail authorities to the governor of Maharashtra. As the governor had no jurisdiction to decide, since the president had rejected an earlier mercy petition, he was bound to forward it to the president. However, the governor simply sat on it. This forced us to send a mercy petition directly to the president. On 29 July, the day before Memon's date of execution, both the mercy petitions were yet to be decided. Soon after the Supreme Court verdict in the afternoon, the governor, instead of sending it to the president, dismissed the mercy petition. The president did the same that night. Surely, Yakub Memon should have been allowed to exercise his fundamental right to challenge the rejection of his mercy petition? Again, the Supreme Court disagreed. Would the heavens have fallen if Yakub Memon was given 14 days to challenge the rejection of his mercy petition? I would submit no. And what if his challenge against the mercy petition resulted in a commutation? Then it would have been a fatal mistake to have denied him the 14 days. This was Memon's fundamental right. It cannot be sacrificed at the altar of sticking to a fixed date set for his hanging by the sessions court or the fact that an earlier petition filed by his brother had been dismissed. That is why I believe that the Supreme Court's decision has led to a grave miscarriage of justice. Yakub Memon has been hanged and is no more.

{"article": "Choices are always subjective, since Ronny Deila came to work in a new country when he joined Celtic last summer but he also has the benefit of a squad that is better stocked than those at the other clubs and a budget that far outstrips all rivals. There are only three major domestic trophies to play for, so prizes alone are not a reliable guide. Here, then, are four potential candidates for manager of the year. Last year's winner, having led the Pittodrie side to a League Cup triumph, McInnes has continued to improve his team. He signed shrewdly in the summer and has managed his squad with enough aplomb that the early European qualifying ties have not diminished the squad's energy or application through the season. The three league defeats to Celtic will still rankle, but that is a measure of how far he has taken Aberdeen since for a spell they were considered title challengers. It is the consistency of the side, its ability to overcome every other side in the top-flight with commanding performances, that have impressed - their last league defeat to a side other than Celtic was to Hamilton in October. History weighs heavily on Aberdeen, but McInnes has risen to the challenge of restoring Aberdeen to a prominent place in Scottish football with a second-place finish already secured. There might have been another League Cup final, too, if Dundee United hadn't prevailed in the semi-final. The title is expected every season, but there is still an achievement in the way that Ronny Deila has adapted to living and working in Scotland and imposed a different style of play on the team. There was an initial difficult spell, and European displays were generally disappointing, but he has grown into the job in the same way that the side has grown comfortable with his tactics and methods. Deila was unabashed in his pursuit of the treble, and responded with perspective when he chose not to dwell on the Josh Meekings handball that contributed to Inverness Caledonian Thistle's victory in the Scottish Cup semi-final. Deila has personality, but his body of work this season suggests that there is also worth to his philosophy and ideals. Celtic need to improve further, but this was a debut season in Scottish football that suggested he is capable of developing his team while still being accomplished enough to guide Celtic to trophies. An unheralded club and, at times, an unheralded manager. Hughes is an imposing figure in Scottish football, loud, animated, jocular, but he is proving again to be a wily manager. He realised that emphasising the siege mentality at a club that is geographically remote from the Central Belt powerbases of Scottish football would be a powerful motivating factor for his players. Even so, he insists upon a pleasing, attacking style of play that has delivered results this season. Hughes took Inverness to the League Cup final last season, and now they are in the Scottish Cup final, an achievement that was in part down to a mistake by the match officials in the semi-final, but also to Hughes urging his players to keep attacking in extra-time. It was typical of his approach that the two full-backs combined for the winning goal. He has brought better performances from his players, in particular Graeme Shinnie, and could yet be playing in European qualifiers next season if they finish third or win the cup. The Tynecastle side have been so dominant in the Championship this season that they have been overlooked in recent weeks. Yet the scale of Neilson's achievement is remarkable. Heart of Midlothian Football Club plc only emerged from administration last summer, when Ann Budge's regime appointed Craig Levein as director of football and Neilson as head coach. It was his first managerial job and the squad was still essentially made up of young players who came through the ranks. Some shrewd signings later, Hearts went on a run that left the rest of the division in their wake. It was 24 January when they first lost a game in the league, the title was won in March, and their haul of 90 points with one game still remaining is a record. Neilson has focused on the promotion campaign, so cup results have been poor, but he has proved to be an innovative young manager, utilising triple training sessions and implementing an impressive style of play while still generally fielding a young team.", "question": "The best players of the season in Scotland have already been identified , but another accolade is still to be awarded .

{"article": "He spent seven months at Ibrox, leaving on January 4 2007, a spell that encompassed 31 games and generated a number of theories about why the Frenchman failed. Reflections on Le Guen's time tend to fall into two perspectives: he misunderstood the key aspects of the job, or the players were unreceptive to his methods and ideology. The reality is most likely somewhere in between, since some of his thoughts on diet and training are now commonplace, but also some of the same players went on to be successful under Le Guen's successor, Walter Smith. Le Guen arrived with a strong reputation. He won three successive league titles with Lyon, as well as twice reaching the Champions League quarter-finals. He was urbane and cosmopolitan, and the expectation was that he would transform Rangers. Instead, it was his own reputation that was altered. There were errors of judgement from the outset and struggles to properly communicate with the players. The Frenchman had set ideas about training, but failed to modify them to the circumstances. He did not want tackling during sessions, but failed to grasp the competitive nature of Scottish football and players. Le Guen ought to have introduced his changes gradually. He split training into two sessions across the day, with a break of several hours in between. Media playback is not supported on this device That interval should have been an opportunity for the players to sleep - and many clubs now have sleeping quarters inside their training ground, or temporary sleep pods installed - but there were no facilities for that and the players instead became bored. Le Guen understood that the job was to improve the club and the team, but he never adapted to the working environment. He needed the squad of players to buy into his approach, but many of them felt disheartened. Le Guen was part of the generation of coaches who understood the differences that nutrition can make to elite performance. He insisted that crisps were removed from the vending machines at the training ground and the players' diets were monitored and changed. There is now a far greater acceptance of the need to refuel properly, that the timings of protein and carbohydrate intake are important, that players need to live as athletes 24 hours a day, that alcohol intake should be limited, that sleep and adequate hydration are vital. Le Guen's ideas were valid, but his failure was to convince the players of their worth. Arsene Wenger initially encountered resistance at Arsenal, but soon the likes of Tony Adams and Martin Keown were enthusiastic advocates for the worth of good nutrition, stretching and recovery periods. Le Guen made a decisive move when he sent Fernando Ricksen home from a pre-season tour to South Africa for his drinking and misbehaviour on the flight, but while he was justified in his actions, it was not enough to underpin his leadership of the squad. The strongest personality in the dressing room was captain Barry Ferguson, but Le Guen did not foster a good enough relationship with the midfielder. A fiercely competitive figure, who was brought through the youth ranks by coaches steeped in the club's demand to win every contest, Ferguson grew increasingly frustrated with the team's poor form and an outburst following a downturn in results led to Le Guen banishing him. The fact that some of Ferguson's team-mates still perceive this act as the Frenchman trying to initiate his departure tells of the dysfunctional relationship between the players and the manager. Le Guen never grasped the level of demand at Rangers, he never realised that dropped points are never considered acceptable even in the context of the season as a whole. Of all the misjudgements, perhaps the most influential was Le Guen's failure to come to terms with Scottish football. The quality is diminished compared to elsewhere on the continent, but aggression, competitiveness, desire to win and physical strength - running, heading and work-rate - are all common attributes. Le Guen underestimated the game in Scotland. That undermined his recruitment, too, since he signed players like Karl Svensson, a centre-back who struggled with the aerial demands of Scottish football. The causes were varied, since his budget was limited compared to the funds one of his predecessors, Dick Advocaat, had been able to spend on building a team. Yet Le Guen also came from a club in Lyon with a well-established recruitment department that had extensive experience of identifying signing targets and a president with a savvy understanding of market values. At Rangers, Le Guen was essentially on his own when it came to recruitment and that showed, with three of his 12 signings coming from one club - Austria Vienna. Ultimately, only one of the 12 arrivals, Sasa Papac, was capable of thriving in Scottish football. By then, Le Guen was a distant memory.", "question": "In the end , the only @placeholder Paul le Guen achieved at Rangers was to be the club 's shortest serving manager .", "option_0": "team", "option_1": "lost", "option_2": "body", "option_3": "distinction", "option_4": "practice", "label": 3}

Barbara Dring, the city council's licensing sub-committee chair, said it was revoked to protect public safety. Legs 11 has not responded to requests for a comment. Read more stories from Birmingham and the Black Country Chris Neville, head of licensing, said the club had ceased trading.

In the committee's report, he said two men had claimed they were drugged, with one testing positive for methadone with a home testing kit. The club was being investigated over 17 fraud-related allegations since 2013, police said. Some customers paid for dances \"in a private area\" but additional transactions were taking place that they had not authorised, Supt Parsons added. One victim claimed he had lost as much as £19,417. Mrs Dring said councillors saw \"deeply concerning\" CCTV footage in the meeting, which was closed to the public, including of sales of alcohol to \"clearly inebriated\" patrons. They heard evidence customers had lost \"significant sums of money\" through unauthorised transactions, while others were \"routinely overcharged\" by the venue which turned over £1.6m in one six-month period, she said.

{"article": "Mr Abbott has said more Syrian asylum seekers would be let in but has stopped short of boosting overall refugee numbers. But members of his own party, including several state premiers, have called for more to be done for refugees. Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Monday called for temporary housing of Syrian and Iraqi asylum seekers. Mr Frydenberg said there was a good case for a Kosovo-type solution that would see Syrian and Iraqi refugees housed in Australia, then returned home once the countries were safe. The Federal Opposition on Monday called for 10,000 additional places for refugees from the Middle East, with priority to be given to those from conflicts in Syria and Iraq. Opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten also said the government should spend an extra $A100m ($69m; Â£45.6m) on aid for refugees. The Liberal Premier of Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, Mike Baird, on Saturday challenged Mr Abbott to do more than just stopping refugees making their way to Australia by boat. Reacting to a photo of a Syrian child refugee recently found drowned on a Turkish beach, Mr Baird said he felt \"sick with overwhelming sorrow\" about the situation. Mr Baird, a close colleague of Mr Abbott's, said it was a great thing that Australia was no longer seeing children drowning at sea after trying to get to Australia by boat with their families. \"But stopping the boats can't be where this ends ... I believe we should do even more. And we should do it now,\" he said, adding that he would talk to the Federal government about what could be done. Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat, and takes them to offshore processing centres to be resettled elsewhere. Last week, the New York Times described the policy as \"brutal\". The lightly-populated island state of Tasmania has also said it would accept an extra 500 refugees, with Liberal Premier Will Hodgman declaring \"our door's open\". Australia has accepted about 4,500 people fleeing Syria's conflict, under its current commitment of 13,750 refugees for 2015. Mr Abbott has claimed Australia is \"already the most generous country in the world on a per capita basis when it comes to dealing with refugees through the UNHCR\". Several organisations have challenged that claim. During a press conference on Sunday, the Prime Minister spoke of how horrified he was by the image of the drowned Syrian boy. \"No parent could fail to be moved by what we saw,\" he said. \"I have asked the Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to go urgently to Geneva to talk to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on what more Australia can do to assist on the migration crisis that is being driven by the problems in the Middle East,\" he said.", "question": "Australia 's Prime Minister Tony Abbott is under pressure to increase the country 's total refugee @placeholder .", "option_0": "election", "option_1": "intake", "option_2": "system", "option_3": "group", "option_4": "body", "label": 1}

{"article": "China and North Korea seem to be heading into yet another tense period in their recently rocky relationship. Once brothers-in-arms fighting against \"imperialist aggression\" during the Korean War, now Beijing accuses Pyongyang publicly of breaching United Nations sanctions in the pursuit of its missile and nuclear weapons programmes. And the apparent assassination of Kim Jong-nam - the half brother of North Korea's brutal leader - is being seen as a fresh point of tension between these official allies. In fact, some view it as direct slap in the face for China. It appears Mr Kim was murdered in Kuala Lumpur airport, on his way back to Macau, by female killers using of some type of poison. Kim Jong-nam spent much of the past decade in a type of self-imposed exile inside the former Portuguese colony. There he was seen to have the protection of China. The eldest son of North Korea's late leader Kim Jong-il, he said time and again that he had no interest in becoming involved in his country's politics. What's more, whenever he was cornered by reporters in the Asian casino city, with his shirt unbuttoned to number three and sporting a three-day growth, you could really believe him when he said it. After all, why would he want to? There has been speculation that he operated some sort of North Korean sanction-busting slush fund out of Macau and that this was the reason that Beijing and Pyongyang tolerated his hedonistic life style. But for China there was something else too. He was an ally inside the North Korean elite: somebody who thought the best way forward for his homeland was a Chinese-style opening up. For years, China has been trying to promote this style of thinking with its isolated, impoverished neighbour. Before he died, Kim Jong-il was shown around the prosperous Chinese city of Dalian. The message: \"You too could have some of this at home with a bit of opening up!\" But the Kim dynasty has appeared petrified by the prospect of such openness, and that Kim Jong-nam would side with the Chinese. So despite his apparent lack of interest in political power, the fact that he could be seen hanging around down in Macau as a possible leader to be called on by Beijing in the event of regime collapse in Pyongyang made him a threat to the paranoid figure in power there today. If this was a political assassination, then most North Korea observers think the order came right from the top. This will not go down well with the government of Xi Jinping in Beijing. In recent days the two countries' relationship has become even more murky. South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported that China turned back a $1m (Â£800,000) coal shipment from North Korea. China has long been criticised for turning a blind eye to North Korean coal exports, in violation of UN sanctions, but maybe not this time. In the wake of last weekend's North Korean ballistic missile test, 16,295 tonnes of its coal were denied entry to Wenzhou Port in Zhejiang Province. You see the sequence of events: Sunday 12 February missile test, next morning an ally of China is murdered, later that afternoon Beijing criticises the test, two days later the coal shipment is turned back. What's next? When asked about the death of Kim Jong-nam, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said his government had \"seen the media reports\" and that that they were \"following the developments\". I'll bet they are. At a social function run by the Chinese military recently, I was speaking to a Chinese officer about the US demand that they do more to bring pressure on North Korea. He shrugged his shoulders. He said they didn't know what the North Koreans would do next and that they had no idea what China could do to change their minds. Yet by far and away the vast majority of trade in and out of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), as the country prefers to be called, is with China. If you take Chinese trade out of the equation there's not much left. So why would Beijing put up with all this? Why put up with the waves of instability flowing out of Korean peninsula? The answer is US troops. It's often said that a meltdown in North Korea could lead to millions of refugees pouring into China but, even if this did happen, it would likely only be a temporary problem. No. The real fear is that a complete collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to Korean unification, with American soldiers based in a country with a land border with China. Beijing will not let that happen and Pyongyang's current ruler, Kim Jong-un, knows it. So no matter how many times North Korea drives its powerful protector to distraction, in the end, Beijing believes it doesn't have much choice but to put up with its weirdness, with its basket-case economy, with its erratic behaviour and probably also with its pursuit of nuclear weapons.", "question": "Beijing needs to do more to rein in North Korea : that 's the view of US President Donald Trump and his new @placeholder .

It said it \"stands by the decision to report the investigation... and the search of his property\". Last week prosecutors said the singer would face no charges. Sir Cliff told Tuesday's Daily Mail he is considering suing the BBC. The singer said in the interview that the BBC \"have a lot to answer for\" for broadcasting the raid live on TV. \"Somebody has to teach them a lesson and if it's done by suing, let's do it,\" he said. \"And the same with South Yorkshire Police. They have damaged me in a great way,\" he added. \"The BBC is very sorry that Sir Cliff Richard, who has worked as a musician and performer for so many years with the organisation, has suffered distress. The BBC's responsibility is to report fully stories that are in the public interest. Police investigations into prominent figures in public life are, of course, squarely in the public interest, which is why they have been reported by all news organisations in this country. Once the South Yorkshire Police had confirmed the investigation and Sir Cliff Richard's identity and informed the BBC of the timing and details of the search of his property, it would neither have been editorially responsible nor in the public interest to choose not to report fully the investigation into Sir Cliff Richard because of his public profile. The BBC, at every stage, reported Sir Cliff's full denial of the allegations. The BBC, therefore, stands by the decision to report the investigation undertaken by the South Yorkshire Police and the search of his property. Sir Cliff has made the argument that the identity of people under investigation into historic allegations should not be made public until they are charged. This view raises significant questions about the scrutiny of the police and public confidence that allegations are investigated. That said, we respect the fact that he is making an important statement in the debate over balancing privacy rights with the public interest. Ultimately, though, deciding whether people should remain anonymous while the subject of a police investigation is a matter for Parliament.

Sir Cliff said he was \"obviously thrilled that the vile accusations and the resulting investigation have finally been brought to a close\". BBC cameras and a reporter were outside the gates to Sir Cliff's property in Sunningdale, Berkshire when police officers arrived to search his home in August 2014. A cameraman in a helicopter also filmed it. In his first interview since the investigation ended, Sir Cliff said the BBC's filming of the raid was an \"unforgiveable\" invasion into his privacy. \"They must be thinking I will sue them. Once, I would have been reluctant. It's tempting to forget the whole thing, but people like myself are in a very privileged position to possibly change things so it doesn't happen to anyone else,\" he told The Mail. Last year, an independent investigation concluded that South Yorkshire Police should not have released \"highly confidential\" information to the BBC about a planned search of Sir Cliff Richard's home. In a statement, South Yorkshire Police apologised \"wholeheartedly for the additional anxiety caused\" to Sir Cliff by the force's \"initial handling of the media interest\" in its investigation. \"The police have apologised, but the BBC hasn't, and it owes me that,\" Sir Cliff told the newspaper. \"What it did to me was shameful. No one should have to go through what I did. \"My name was plastered everywhere before I was even questioned. When they broke into the apartment, I had no idea why. None at all. Later, they [the BBC] even boasted that the raid on my home was the news scoop of the year.\" But Sir Cliff said he does not want \"heads to roll\" or \"revenge\". \"I want to be able to say: 'The BBC should never have done this',\" he said. Sir Cliff's friend of 45 years, broadcaster Gloria Hunniford, told BBC Radio 5 live's Nicky Campbell he has \"never really been back\" to the apartment. She said he has been affected both mentally and physically by the two-year investigation. Sir Cliff found that \"when he started playing tennis again, which he loves and that's his way of keeping fit, all the strength had gone from his body completely\". Hunniford encouraged him to \"live his life and be joyous\" now the investigation is over, but said he still feels \"angry with (South) Yorkshire Police and the BBC\".", "question": "The BBC has said it is \" very sorry \" Sir Cliff Richard \" suffered distress \" after its coverage of the 2014 police raid on his home , over historical allegations of @placeholder abuse .", "option_0": "escalating", "option_1": "sex", "option_2": "arresting", "option_3": "neighbouring", "option_4": "state", "label": 1}

{"article": "The departure of Huw Irranca-Davies, who's quitting Westminster to seek a seat in the Welsh Assembly, has created an opening for a chair of the Environmental Audit Committee - which he has only held for a couple of months. That committee chair has been allocated to the Labour Party - but all MPs across all parties have a vote in the election, which will be held next week. Nominations close on Monday, and so far three runners have emerged: former leadership candidate Mary Creagh, Co-Op party stalwart Geraint Davies and Barry Gardiner. That last name is an interesting one, because Mr Gardiner - an acknowledged energy policy expert - is part of Labour's shadow energy team. He says his leadership are completely relaxed about his attempt to swap the front bench for the committee corridor. An effective chair is crucial to the impact a select committee has, and Environmental Audit, with its cross-government remit, could become a real powerhouse, under the right leadership. Looking at the membership of the special select committee peers voted to set up, to consider the impact of the Trade Union Bill on party funding (there were warnings that its provisions could cut funding for the Labour Party by Â£6m), I suspect there might be. The crossbench peer and former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns is the chairman, and batting for the government are four Conservatives: Lord Callanan, Lord de Mauley, Lord Robathan and Lord Sherbourne of Didsbury. Labour field ex-union officials Baroness Dean (former Leader of SOGAT), Lord (Larry) Whitty (ex GMB) and Baroness Drake (a former President of the TUC) plus the former Leader of the House, Lord Richard. The Lib Dem contingent consists of Lord Tyler, who first proposed this committee, and Lord Wrigglesworth. And the team is completed by the newly arrived Crossbencher, the Earl of Kinnoull. Looking at that cast of characters, the committee will probably end up providing a line of argument helpful to the Labour-Lib Dem cause when it reports at the end of February, tee-ing up hostile amendments which could well be voted through at report stage - unless both Crossbench peers repeatedly side with the Conservatives. Last week saw a relative rarity; a meeting of the Commons Privileges Committee, which deals with matters touching the rights of the House. It was a private meeting so I don't know what they talked about - but just about the only privileges issue in their in-tray is the complaint from the last parliament that three witnesses, Tom Crone, Colin Myler and Les Hinton, and that the company they had worked for, News International, misled the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committeeâ€¦. This dates all the way back to 2012 when, on a majority vote, the committee included that claim in their report on the phone hacking scandal. While there were a number of live criminal trials of other individuals accused of hacking offences, the Privileges Committee postponed any action - but the coast is now clear. Could we see a final act in the hacking scandal? Will witnesses like Les Hinton (he issued a rebuttal of the committee's claims, which he called \"unfair, unfounded and erroneous\") be re-examined, or will the complaint be dropped as quietly as possible. Watch this space. When an MP is arrested, for whatever reason, the fact is recorded in the Commons business papers; this is an immemorial convention dating back to the days when such an arrest may well have been an attempt by the Crown to interfere in the workings of Parliament. But these days it can highlight an allegation against an MP at an early stage, far earlier than would be the case for non-MPs. Next month the Commons will vote on a proposal to change that, so in future arrests will only be reported where the Clerks consider that what has happened is, in some way an infringement of the rights of Parliament; so an arrest for, say, a bar-room brawl, would not be publicised in the Commons business papers; but the Damian Green case, where an MP's Commons office was searched, would. Of course this would not stop Her Majesty's Press finding out in other ways....it just wouldn't be via an official Commons publication. Blink and you'd have missed the one overt sign of it, but behind the scenes, there's a considerable spat under way about the game-playing over private members' bill debates on a Commons Friday. Last week, private members' bill terminator Chris Chope was so annoyed at the government's tactics that he shouted \"object\" - and blocked an attempt to give an unopposed second reading to an uncontroversial measure to tidy up an MPs' hardship fund, set up after World War II, much to the visible annoyance of the bill's promoter, Sir Paul Beresford. A minimal morsel of revenge, perhaps, but it presages a bigger problem. You see, the supply of private members' bills is drying up. So many of the current crop of bills were killed off at second reading, that there are only a handful left to return to the Commons for report stage and third reading - and there are still plenty of sitting Fridays scheduled: on 29 January, 5 and 26 February, and 4 and 11 March. If there are no bills left to come back to the Commons, where they would take priority for debate, then all sorts of presentation bills and ten minute rule bills might suddenly end up being debated. Bills on subjects like human trafficking, ovarian cancer, bat habitats, BBC privatisation and much, much more might surface for debate. And since most of them emanate from Mr Chope and his usual suspect colleague, Peter Bone, they will mostly be on subjects the government would prefer not to have debated and not to have to respond to.

{"article": "The European Commission's authorisation process is controversial. The latest approvals were condemned by Green MEPs and Greenpeace environmentalists. Fifty-eight GM crops are already used in food and animal feed in the EU. But cultivation is restricted to just one - a type of maize. US biotech firms want the rules eased. The 17 new crop authorisations consist of: soybean (five types), cotton (seven types), maize (three types) and oilseed rape (two types). Cottonseed meal and oil is used in animal feed. GM crops are used widely in the US, South America and Asia, but many Europeans are wary of their impact on health and wildlife. In the EU, 60% of animal feed is imported. The protein-rich soya in that feed comes overwhelmingly from countries that plant GM soybeans - Brazil, Argentina and the US, the Commission says. GM in food is one of the toughest issues at the EU-US talks on a free trade deal, known as TTIP. Green MEP Bart Staes, a food safety specialist, accused the Commission of ignoring widespread opposition to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) among EU citizens. \"This gung-ho approach to GMOs also has to be seen in the context of the EU-US TTIP negotiations and the long-running US campaign to force their GMOs on to the EU market,\" he said. On Wednesday, the Commission proposed a new law allowing individual EU countries to restrict or ban imported GM crops, even if those crops have been authorised EU-wide by the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa). A country would have to justify its opt-out from a certain GM crop type, stating specific national or regional grounds for the restriction. Social or environmental impact could be cited as justification for a national ban, rather than purely health concerns. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the proposal left the US \"very disappointed\" and he called it \"hard to reconcile with the EU's international obligations\". The only GM crop cultivated in the EU - Monsanto's maize variety MON 810 - is banned in several EU countries. Spain is by far the biggest grower of MON 810 in Europe, but the crop accounts for just 1.56% of the EU's total maize-growing area.

Her family denies she broke any laws. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who is from London, said his wife's detention was a \"stain\" on Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, who works for the charity the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been detained in Iran since her arrest last year. The couple's two-year-old daughter has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport, and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family said in September that a Revolutionary Court had handed down the five-year term. She was accused of allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but the official charges against her were not made public. According to Mr Ratcliffe, his wife's appeal was dismissed in a secret hearing of an Iranian Revolutionary Court on 4 January but only announced on 22 January. In a statement, her husband said the precise charges against her remain secret, but that two new accusations were made at her appeal. One was that she had been head of recruitment for the BBC's Farsi service when it was launched in 2009. Her family say she worked on a BBC training project for youth in Afghanistan and Iran, but never worked for BBC Farsi. The other charge was that she was married to a British spy. Mr Ratcliffe is an accountant. Monique Villa, chief executive of Thomson Reuters Foundation said she is \"outraged by this new mockery of justice\", and reiterated Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe never worked for BBC Farsi and that her husband \"is not a spy but a reputable accountant\". \"I am fully convinced of Nazanin's innocence,\" she added. Francesca Unsworth, BBC World Service Group director, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had briefly worked for charity BBC Media Action in a \"junior administrative capacity\" but had never worked for BBC Persian. \"In any case, to suggest that being employed by BBC Persian is tantamount to 'acting against national security' is patently ludicrous,\" Ms Unsworth added. Mr Ratcliffe said: \"The lack of justice in Nazanin's case continues to be a stain on Iran. The continued attempt to frame Nazanin behind secrets and lies brings shame. \"It is a needless waste of a mother and child's life for their own political bargains and economic interests.\" Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, meaning those detained cannot receive consular assistance.

{"article": "The House of Representatives passed a Republican bill proposed by Speaker John Boehner, but that was quickly killed by the Democratic-led Senate. Senate leader Harry Reid is now seeking a vote on a rival plan he proposed. The US risks defaulting on its financial obligations if a federal budget deal is not struck by 2 August. The Boehner plan includes some $900bn of spending cuts and would raise the debt ceiling by a similar amount. However it would require another vote during mid-2012 and includes language in support of a so-called \"balanced budget amendment\" to the US constitution - both rejected by the White House and the Senate leadership. The House vote was delayed from Thursday after Mr Boehner struggled to win over a number of staunchly conservative Republicans, including newly elected representatives who back the Tea Party. The plan eventually passed the House by 218-210, with 22 Republicans and every Democrat voting against. Before the vote, Mr Boehner said the plan advanced the \"great cause\" of a balanced budget amendment. Mr Boehner appeared heated in front of his colleagues in the House, slamming his fist on a podium on Friday evening and calling for lawmakers to pass his proposal. Mr Boehner said Republicans had tried their \"level best\" to reach a deal. \"I stuck my neck out a mile to get an agreement with the president of the United States,\" Mr Boehner said, referring to negotiations with President Barack Obama that twice broke down. \"My colleagues, I can tell you I have worked with the president and the administration since the beginning of this year to avoid being in this spot,\" he added. By Mark MardellBBC North America editor Read more of Mark's thoughts \"A lot of people in this town can never say yes,\" Mr Boehner said. Shortly after the House passed its bill, the Democratic-led Senate voted to reject the Boehner plan in a late-evening vote on Friday. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid accused the Republicans of seeking to filibuster, or delay, proceedings by forcing a vote on his rival plan to achieve a 60-vote \"supermajority\" before passing. Speaking after the Senate adjourned for the night, he accused his Republican counterpart of not being willing to negotiate. \"Unless there is a compromise, or they accept my bill, we're heading for economic disaster,\" he said. The US government will start running out of money to pay all its bills unless a $14.3tn (Â£8.79tn) borrowing limit is increased by Tuesday. Democrats say the Republican bill as passed would cause immeasurable damage to the economy because it would force Congress to vote on another extension of the debt ceiling early in 2012, a time when presidential election campaigns will be in full swing. The White House quickly responded to the passage of Mr Boehner's bill, calling for a \"compromise that avoids default and lays the basis for balanced deficit reduction\". Earlier, the White House said Mr Boehner was taking a dangerous approach with his proposal. \"Amend the constitution or default is a highly dangerous game to play,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. Meanwhile, Mr Obama accused House Republicans of pursuing a partisan bill that would force Washington into another debt limit fight within months. \"There are plenty of ways out of this mess, but we are almost out of time,\" Mr Obama said. \"The time for putting party first is over,\" he added. \"The time for compromise on behalf of the American people is now.\" Analysts predict a last-minute scramble for a compromise and razor-edge votes in both chambers, with the high-stakes game of legislative brinkmanship expected to continue all weekend. The president backs Mr Reid's proposal, which would cut $2.2tn from deficits and raise the debt ceiling by $2.7tn. The Boehner and Reid plans overlap in key ways, such as trimming spending over 10 years and shunning President Obama's call for tax increases on the wealthy and corporations.

Inspectors said although it was a training prison, staff shortages meant most prisoners could only attend education or work for three-and-a-half days a week.

Burkina Faso's government says 28 people were killed and a further 56 injured. This is the first time that AQIM has claimed credit for a high-profile attack in the country. But it has been active in several countries in the region, including Mauritania, Mali, Niger and its home, Algeria. While al-Murabitoun has previously carried out several attacks in Mali, the group was not known to be behind any significant activity in neighbouring Burkina Faso. The group had previously said that it was behind the abduction in April of a Romanian national in the north of Burkina Faso and issued a video featuring a plea for help by the hostage who worked for a mining company. The attack on the Splendid Hotel in Burkina Faso is reminiscent of a similar armed assault that targeted the Radisson Blu hotel in Mali's capital, Bamako, in November last year. That involved mass shootings and hostage-taking. Both hotels were reportedly frequented by UN staff as well as Western nationals. The latest attack also bears striking similarities to the January 2013 attack on the In Amenas gas facility in southern Algeria by al-Murabitoun, which is led by the Algerian veteran jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar. At least 39 foreign hostages were killed. The Bamako hotel attack was claimed jointly by AQIM and al-Murabitoun. The claim of responsibility was soon followed by a merger between the two groups. AQIM's leader, Abu-Mus'ab Abd-al-Wadud (aka Abdelmalek Droukdel), warned the French people of further attacks against them if they failed to prevent their government from \"leaving alone\" Muslims and their lands.

{"article": "Qatar, a sovereign Arab state, is being subjected to unprecedented sanctions by its Gulf Arab neighbours, led by Saudi Arabia. The punishing economic and diplomatic measures have been taken because of allegations that Qatar has persisted in funding terrorist groups and destabilising the region, both of which it denies. So now airspace has been closed, imports stopped at borders, Qatari expatriates expelled. The veneer of Gulf Arab unity, as embodied in the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), has worn off. Even if, as expected, the immediate crisis is resolved by talks, the Gulf will never be the same again. Now there are fears this action may push this region down a new and dangerous path. The action against Qatar has been initiated by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt - four countries ruled by Sunni Muslim leaderships that see the world through the prism of two major threats to their rule: Iran and political Islam, coupled with violent jihad. They accuse Qatar of encouraging both strands. On Iran, the quartet's complaint appears to be excessive. Qatar shares with Iran the world's largest natural gas condensate field - the offshore South Pars/North Dome Field. Geography has made them neighbours, they need to get on. But Saudi Arabia's rulers, encouraged by President Donald Trump's recent visit to Riyadh and his strong condemnation of Tehran, would prefer to see a united Gulf Arab stand against its arch rival Iran. Qatar, in their eyes, is \"letting the side down\". On political Islam, it is easier to see why the dynastic monarchies of the Gulf feel threatened by Qatar's actions. Qatar's ruling family, the Al-Thani's, have long supported the Muslim Brotherhood, which espouses a pan-Islamic caliphate that would ultimately do away with current rulers. Qatar has backed Islamist movements in Egypt, Libya, Syria and the Gaza Strip. They have allowed the country's satellite TV channel, Al-Jazeera, to host vocal critics of Arab leaders, although not Qatar's. The UAE Crown Prince, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, told me he sees the Muslim Brotherhood as an existential threat to the region. On terrorism, the picture is more opaque. Saudi Arabia and its allies accuse Qatar of funding terrorist groups, notably in Syria and Iraq. A lot of people say this is a case of hypocrisy, of the pot calling the kettle black. In a failed bid to topple Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Saudi Arabia has itself funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars to hardline Sunni fighters in Syria, some of which has ended up in the hands of so-called Islamic State. There is no denying though, that Qatar has had connections to the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front in Syria. On one of my visits to the Qatari capital, Doha, Qatari intelligence officials personally told me in 2014 how they had successfully brought about the release of hostages held by this group. That group would naturally have demanded something substantial in exchange. In April this year it has been reported that a staggering $1bn (Â£784m) ransom was paid by Qatar to terrorist groups in Iraq, some of it to Iran, in order to secure the release of 26 princes kidnapped while hunting a large game bird called a bustard. Qatar denies it. While the action to isolate and punish Qatar reflects a joint view held by several countries, leading the charge is the 31-year-old Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defence Minister, Mohammed Bin Salman, known as MBS. The question many are asking now is whether MBS has gone too far. Saudi Arabia already has enough trouble on its hands. Together with the UAE, it's spent the last two years fighting an inconclusive and deeply destructive war in Yemen. It's coping with a simmering insurgency in its Shia-dominated Eastern Province. It is still part of the US-led coalition against IS, a group that has already bombed several Saudi mosques and threatened more attacks only this month. The real long term cost of isolating Qatar may well turn out to be economic. To attract business and provide jobs for their swelling youth population, the Gulf Arab states need stability and a business-friendly environment. It is hard to see how this stand-off could do more to damage this. The longer it persists, the deeper the wounds, not just to Qatar and its tiny, affluent population, but to the entire region.", "question": "Gulf residents are still in @placeholder .", "option_0": "response", "option_1": "shock", "option_2": "sight", "option_3": "droves", "option_4": "overdrive", "label": 1}

The details are contained in an Office for National Statistics analysis of violent crime and sexual offences. Overall, there were 571 homicides, a category that includes manslaughter, murder and infanticide - up 57 on 2015. The figures show 69% of homicide victims were male, 31% female, with marked increases in male victims aged 25 to 34, and 75 and over. The ONS said 44% of women were killed by their partner or ex-partner and 35% of male victims died at the hands of a friend or acquaintance. Nineteen per cent of female victims were strangled. Of the 38 child victims, 22 were killed by a parent or step-parent, and four were known to have been killed by a stranger. As in previous years, the most common method of killing was by knife or other sharp instrument with 213 victims. The second most common method was kicking or hitting. Twenty-six people were shot dead. Similar to previous years, about a half of all homicide cases resulted from a quarrel, a revenge attack or a loss of temper. By last November, a suspect had been charged in 79% of cases. The ONS said the incidence rate for homicide remained relatively low, with 9.9 homicides recorded per million of the population during the year ending March 2016.

The level then was 80 times the official limit, regional environment protection official Feng Zhennian said. Teams have been putting neutralising chemicals into the river to treat the contamination. Mr Feng, who is also a spokesman for the emergency response centre managing the spill, did not name the seven people at the press briefing on Monday. But he said one of the companies involved was Jinchengjiang Hongquan Lithopone Material in Hechi city. Xinhua reported last week that another company, the Guangxi Jinhe Mining Co, was suspected of causing the contamination. Officials said on Saturday that cadmium levels at the source of the pollution near the Lalang reservoir had normalised. The pollution concern was now near the Luodong hydropower station downstream, said Mr Feng. Cadmium levels there were still 25 times higher than the official limit, he added. Local officials told Xinhua that they had stepped up efforts to ensure water safety for nearby cities. Over the past week the local fire department and police force have been putting neutralisers, made of dissolved ammonium chloride, into various locations in the river in an attempt to treat the contamination. Cadmium, commonly found in industrial usage such as the production of batteries, is a carcinogen which can damage the kidneys, bones and respiratory system.

{"article": "The warning came after thousands of demonstrators occupied the centre of Homs on Monday, vowing to stay until the president was ousted. Witnesses say security forces fired on the protesters in Homs and there are reports the square was  cleared. Rights activists say about 200 Syrians have been killed in weeks of unrest. By Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic Correspondent Syria matters in ways that make Libya appear peripheral in the region. It is a key element in an alliance that brings together Iran, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Gaza Strip and other more radical Palestinian groups opposed to peace with Israel. If Syria descends into chaos, that alliance could also be weakened. But the most serious impact might be felt in next-door Lebanon: another country made up of a patchwork of different communities which has not enjoyed Syria's long-term stability. One way or another, a strong Syria represents a stabilising element in Lebanon. Chaos in one could lead to chaos in the other. Israel, too, is watching events in its northern neighbour with concern. Syria has long been a predictable enemy. Even a shaken Syrian regime could pose a different kind of problem. Syria crisis could change face of the Middle East President Bashar al-Assad announced on Saturday he would end nearly half a century of emergency rule next week, while the authorities have also been releasing political prisoners, both key demands of protesters. But Syria's unprecedented wave of unrest shows no sign of abating, says the BBC's Kim Ghattas in Beirut, in neighbouring Lebanon. In a statement late on Monday, the interior ministry said: \"The course of the previous events... have revealed they are an armed insurrection by armed groups belonging to Salafist organisations, especially in Homs and Baniyas.\" It warned \"their terrorist activities will not be tolerated\". Salafism is a strict form of Sunni Islam which many Arab governments equate with militant groups like al-Qaeda. Our correspondent says this means the authorities will crack down on dissent under the pretext of fighting terrorists. At least 5,000 demonstrators occupied Clock Square in Homs on Monday after mass funerals for about 12 protesters slain by security forces at the weekend. Checkpoints were set up around the square to ensure people coming in were unarmed civilians, and protesters stocked up on supplies. One protester said it had been renamed Tahrir Square, after the one in Cairo which was the focal point of the uprising that toppled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Witnesses said that security forces told them through loud-hailers to leave, before firing tear gas, then live ammunition. One protester, Omar, told BBC Arabic on Tuesday that he had seen one person shot dead. \"Listen to the shooting,\" he said, \"Can you hear it? It's hammering on us like rain. \"Security forces... listen to the shooting, where is it coming from?  It can't be coming from thugs, it's so heavy.\" An activist in the capital Damascus told AFP news agency by telephone: \"The sit-in was dispersed with force. There was heavy gunfire.\" The official Sana news agency has also been reporting on events in Homs. It said three army officers, including a brigadier-general, together with his two sons and a nephew, were killed on Sunday by \"armed criminal gangs\", which then mutilated the bodies. The northern town of Baniyas also saw anti-government protests on Sunday.

{"article": "After all, there was the same right-leaning government, the same absence of peace talks with the Palestinians. But all around, the region had transformed, as the winds of the Arab Spring had blown. Was Israel's apparent quiescence all that it seemed? Israel is a country where the surface picture can distract from deeper, contradictory trends. Take this summer's social protests. They appeared to share, with many Western countries, the rage at capitalism's inequalities. And yet Israel's economy is growing apace - 5% a year - thanks to its world-beating hi-tech sector. And the protesters took a vow of silence on the most contentious issue of all - the conflict with the Palestinians. A short distance north from Tel Aviv lives a man who embodies both those contradictions. Naftali Bennett is the chief executive of the Yesha Council - the Settlers' Council, which represents the ideologically motivated Jews who have set up home in the occupied territories of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. But Mr Bennett does not live in the territories. Rather, this young hi-tech millionaire has just moved into a large house in Israel's expensive central plain. He says the protests are a sign of maturity and health: \"What we saw over the summer was, look, there ain't going to be peace any time soon with the Arabs. So let's fix Israel.\" Naftali Bennett predicts that the next Israeli general election (in just under two years' time) will be the first in Israel's history where domestic, internal politics - rather than \"the conflict\" - will be what the parties scrap over. The state of Israel is on BBC Radio 4 on 6 November at 13:30 GMT and on BBC World Service Assignment on Wednesday 9 and Thursday 10 November The head of the Settlers' Council also sees a symbolic significance in him living, not in the West Bank, but close to Tel Aviv. The settlers are moving in to the mainstream of Israel. Take the conscript army - one of the founding institutions of the state. It is not simply that there are growing numbers of the religious and the settlers performing their national service, and then rising up the professional ranks. Amiad Cohen, the head of security at the West Bank settlement of Eli, 40km outside Jerusalem, is one of those teaching at the growing number of pre-army schools. He travels regularly to one such school, in Tel Aviv, to lead discussions, with secular teenagers. As we walk the perimeter of his settlement, Mr Cohen gestures to the hills around. \"This is our country. We will live here. The question is: 'will it be with peace, or will they force us to fight?'. So yes I'm happy that we influence. The army is a mirror of who we are. And I'm happy that the army is changing.\" Gershom Gorenberg would agree that the army is being reshaped. But the author of the just-published book The Unmaking of Israel says that the changes pose a profound threat. If it were to come to it, Mr Gorenberg asks, and the army were ordered to evacuate settlements in order to end the occupation, would there now be mass insubordination? He argues that when it comes to the occupation, to the increasing tangle between state and synagogue, and to Israel's relations with its own indigenous Arab community, the decisions made, and the decisions put off, \"are undermining Israel's democracy, and indeed its very existence as a state\". Indeed, far from the image of an Israel mired in unchanging politics and stagnant diplomacy, the country feels as if it is living its life on fast-forward.  Quite apart from the revolutions on its borders, and the unfinished business of the occupation, its own population is transforming. According to the official Bureau of Statistics, next year, 47.5% of children entering school will be either haredi (ultra-orthodox) or Arab (or Palestinian with Israeli citizenship, as they increasingly prefer to be called). Both groups, by and large, see themselves as tribes apart from the broad Israeli mainstream. The haredim have traditionally not been part of the tax-paying economy, and have not served in the army - the men spending their time in study of the torah. The Palestinians with Israeli citizenship (22% of the Israeli population, and growing) have long felt disenfranchised and discriminated against in politics, jobs, and housing. Where there is more consensus, among Israel's many groups and tribes and factions, is that another major flare-up may be just around the corner. They do not want it, but it is coming. They have different views as to how wide the blame should be spread, about how far their government is complicit or helpless. But there is more agreement that, while they may want peace, a full resolution, it is beyond reach - perhaps forever. And so, as one diplomat friend in Israel put it, \"the Israelis carry on drinking cappuccino on the side of the volcano\". But perhaps that it is also true of the rest of us, as we gaze on this centre of apparently intractable, inevitable conflict. Israel is a tiny country of seven million on the eastern Mediterranean. But the state of Israel should concern us all.

{"article": "This was how skipper Phil Bennett chose to ignite his red-shirted team-mates before Wales met England in 1977: a rousing oration to match the most stirring of sporting occasions. It has become part of the narrative for this fixture. Us against them, flag around our shoulders, history at our back. Except 38 years on from Bennett's mischievous rabble-rousing, quite where us ends and them begins is rather harder to make out. There will be fierce patriotism on display in the stands and heaving Cardiff streets. For two teams drawn from similar cultural and geographical backgrounds, it may be a little less red and white. There is professionalism, there are postcodes. Of the Welsh team that will charge out at the Millennium Stadium on Friday night, almost a third were born in England. George North began his supersized existence in King's Lynn, Norfolk, centre Jonathan Davies in Solihull, West Midlands. Flanker Dan Lydiate was born in Salford, his fellow forward Luke Charteris in bucolic Camborne in Cornwall. Alex Cuthbert originally hails from Minsterworth in Gloucestershire. Jake Ball - Ascot-born - once captained the Surrey Under-15 rugby team, and later emigrated to Western Australia as a promising fast bowler. As current captain Sam Warburton said when asked, provocatively, about the supposed hatred between the two nations: \"I have to tread very careful with this question, you have to remember my dad's English.\" No-one would suggest that their birthplaces will mean any of those men giving anything but their all against England. Which rather shows how much has changed since Bennett sent his team out on fire and fumes alone. Patriotism is complicated anyway, a personal, nebulous mish-mash of myth, pride and occasion. And professional sport doesn't have much room for the nebulous, for the uncontrolled, for passion without a strict purpose. \"For someone in the Millennium crowd it's probably more important to beat England than to beat New Zealand or Samoa, but for the guy on the pitch it's important to go out there and win every time,\" says Colin Charvis, Sutton Coldfield-born but 94 caps for Wales, captain of his country on more occasions than all but three other men in history. \"As captain you don't focus on something personal. You don't make it anti another nation. I would talk to the players in the dressing-room about how the game was an opportunity, a chance to make a mark. \"In the 1970s the Welsh side was meeting the night before the game in the Angel Hotel and walking across Westgate Street to the pitch. Their build-up time was short and had to be much more intense. \"In today's rugby changing-rooms, you see players sitting down or walking around chatting. That talk is all about focus and what they want to achieve. \"The emphasis going onto the pitch is about what we want to do to stop them scoring points and to score points ourselves. You want focus and you want confidence, not fervour.\" For us supporters sport is often the easiest way into national pride - a simplification of those myriad versions of identity, a unification around a single idea and occasion. No more north and south, no more young or old or right-wing versus left-wing or rich v poor. Instead, a shared shirt and communal song, a common enemy, a shared history. It's what makes the Six Nations work as well as any other competition. Every game matters to those watching, no matter where the two teams may sit in the table. It's fun too. Cardiff's St Mary Street and Chip Alley will see anthropomorphic daffodils raising pints to men dressed as Richard the Lionheart in soft-knit chain-mail. Wales' thumping 30-3 victory over England in the corresponding fixture two years ago was a joyous, unforgettable party for every home supporter present. For those involved on the pitch, often friends, sometimes team-mates more often than rivals, it is rather more complicated. \"Patriotism is big in our camp, we talk a lot about pulling on the blue jersey and playing with pride,\" says Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw, who plays his club rugby in the same Gloucester side as Wales' Richard Hibbard and England's Jonny May. \"A lot of the time it comes down to patriotism - the blood and guts, rolling up your sleeves and getting stuck in. We want to epitomise that in the Six Nations.\" Equally, Laidlaw's squad contains fine players born in Zimbabwe (David Denton), New Zealand (Sean Maitland and Blair Cowan) and Swindon (Jim Hamilton), coached by a man hailing from the other side of the world (Vern Cotter). A captain's task is surely more complex when leading so cosmopolitan a group. Quoting William Wallace has slightly less impact when Englishmen are providing you and your family with a very pleasant lifestyle. It doesn't have to mean less pride to be representing your country. It may just replace some of that famous warrior-poet Braveheart stuff with something more analytical. \"It's about the emotional tie to your jersey and your country,\" believes New Zealander Cotter, one of the four overseas coaches in this year's competition. \"The people who come and support you are very important. They provide the motivation. They strengthen the reason you do things.\" Relish the support. Appreciate the history. And then, when the moment comes, go cold-hearted and dead-eyed. \"Players now are more focused on what exactly the process is to achieve the performance,\" says Charvis. \"Patriotism is not the key motivation. They've spent the best part of their lives trying to play professional rugby. They're all pretty motivated. \"I don't think patriotism is even a 1% advantage. Being able to focus on what you want to achieve is an advantage. \"It doesn't make you more aggressive. The aggression in rugby is matter of fact. Sorry to take the romance out of it, but you treat it as a necessity. \"It's your ability to do that that makes you a long-standing international. An Ospreys player will show aggression as part of the sport to a Scarlets player. You find your own motivation. \"Players are a lot more intimate with players from other countries now. England and Wales players know each other from the Lions. We know the New Zealanders socially, we play in England and France. \"The rugby world is a much smaller place than in the 1970s, when some people thought you needed a passport to cross the Severn Bridge.\" What of the moment the anthems are sung? For every mumbler in the team line-ups come Friday evening, the man staring silently at a patch of turf a few feet in front of him, there will be an Alun Wyn Jones: wild-eyed and roaring, arms physically binding him to his team-mates as Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau binds him to those singing with similar passion in the stands. In that moment, is patriotism not inspiring him to a level of performance he could not otherwise achieve? \"You allow that atmosphere to help you realise how important the event is, and so add to your intent,\" says Charvis, \"but you keep your focus. \"The effort Alun Wyn puts into the anthem is all very important to the end result. It works for him. But he doesn't spend all week at the intensity he's in during the anthem. \"The key is that you all come together, and that for those 80 minutes you work as hard as you possibly can to achieve that goal.

{"article": "The seven-time Tour de France winner was charged by the US Anti-Doping Agency in June with using performance-enhancing drugs going back 16 years. Armstrong, 40, subsequently took legal action against USADA, accusing it of offering \"corrupt inducements\" to other riders to testify against him. The American has always denied doping. The ruling of the Texas court means Armstrong must now face the doping charges and could lose his record-breaking seven Tour de France titles if found guilty. Despite dismissing Armstrong's case against USADA, US District Judge Sam Sparks noted \"troubling aspects\" of the agency's case. He remarked upon the contrast between USADA's determination to pursue with the hearing \"in direct conflict\" with the \"equally evident desire\" of cycling's world governing body, the UCI, not to proceed against him. Armstrong's alleged offences span 1999 to 2005. Should he choose to answer the charges, his case may ultimately be escalated to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. He has previously accused the USADA, which has handed out lifetime bans to three of the five other men accused in his case, of pursuing a vendetta against him. In a statement, the UCI said it had not been a party to the US proceedings and said it had proposed that an independent body should decide whether Armstrong had a case to answer or not.

Bonehill-Paine, of Yeovil, Somerset, posted the articles after the jailing of fellow far-right extremist Garron Helm in October the same year.

{"article": "No one is laughing now. The House Freedom Caucus, the collection of libertarian-leaning conservatives who helped sink the Trump-backed American Health Care Act last week, appears to be as much of a political enemy for the president as the Democratic Party. \"The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast,\" Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. \"We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!\" The tweet was the latest, most pointed, shot at the Freedom Caucus since the healthcare bill collapsed last Friday. In his initial remarks that afternoon, after the bill was unceremoniously pulled from consideration in the midst of being debated in the House, Mr Trump placed the blame squarely on the Democrats. \"We had no votes from the Democrats,\" the president lamented. \"They weren't going to give us a single vote, so it's a very difficult thing to do.\" He also said he had no hard feelings toward the Freedom Caucus, who he described as \"friends of mine\". Over the past week, however, his attitude has shifted. On Sunday the president tweeted that the Freedom Caucus, along with several grass-roots conservative groups, had \"saved\" Obamacare and the women's health group Planned Parenthood, whose clinics provide abortion services. The next day he wrote the Freedom Caucus \"was able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory\". Now it appears the president is preparing for all-out war against the intransigent congressmen - and it's a fight they seem willing to join. Shortly after Mr Trump fired his Thursday morning broadside, Justin Amash, a prominent member of the Freedom Caucus, offered his reply. \"It didn't take long for the swamp to drain Donald Trump,\" he tweeted. \"No shame, Mr President. Almost everyone succumbs to the DC Establishment.\" The fissures appearing beneath Mr Trump's feet as he tries to lead the Republican Party are not new, of course. Speaker of the House John Boehner, who was the top Republican officeholder during much of Barack Obama's presidency, constantly grappled with rebellious House members right up until he was forced from the speakership in September 2015. For the first two months of the Trump presidency, however, it seemed like Republicans - finally in control of all the levers of power in Washington - might be able to present a unified front in advancing an ambitious agenda that included healthcare and tax reform, sweeping cuts in discretionary government programmes, and boosts in military and infrastructure spending. Last week's healthcare fiasco has cast all of that into doubt, with a president unmoored from his own party sending out a number of conflicting messages. After lambasting Democrats last Friday, Mr Trump has made several overtures to the opposition party. On Monday he tweeted the Democrats will be ready to deal once \"Obamacare folds\". \"Do not worry,\" he wrote, \"we are in very good shape.\" The following night he told a bipartisan gathering of senators on Tuesday night that both Democrats and Republicans want to fulfil promises to improve American healthcare. \"I know that we're all going to make a deal on healthcare,\" he said. \"That's such an easy one.\" This set off its own series of tremors in Washington politics. On Wednesday evening Speaker Ryan was asked what he thought of Mr Trump reaching out to Democrats on healthcare reform. \"I don't want that to happen,\" he said. \"You know why? I want a patient-centred system. I don't want government running healthcare. \"The government shouldn't tell you what you must do with your life, with your healthcare. We should give people choices.\" On Thursday morning Bob Corker, a Republican senator from Tennessee, gave the speaker a stinging rebuke. \"We have come a long way in our country when the speaker of one party urges a president NOT to work with the other party to solve a problem,\" he tweeted. A case can be made for a presidential political strategy that attempts to play House Freedom Caucus hard-liners off against Democrats to bring either one group or the other into a governing majority in Congress. If that's the case, however, Mr Trump's strategy of antagonising both groups, 140 characters at a time, seems an uncertain way of realising that goal. Traditional partisan battle lines may at least temporarily re-emerge next week, when the Senate votes on seating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But the fractures in the Republican party will probably once again become apparent with upcoming political fights over the budget, taxes and - perhaps - healthcare once again. Over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump voters time and time again said they were supporting their candidate because they wanted to disrupt the political order in Washington and get things done. While the latter is still very much in doubt, the former is looking more and more like a mission accomplished.", "question": "Last week Donald Trump said he was going to \" come after \" congressman Mark Meadows , the @placeholder of the House Freedom Caucus , if he did n't support the American Health Care Act .

{"article": "Yet online he is occasionally called \"grumpy\" and even \"rude\". \"But he has been here for years and knows almost everybody who comes in,\" says his boss Vicky. \"He knows their sense of humour and has a gruff voice, and jokes around with a lot of people. \"Some people think he's being rude to them, because they don't know him!\" This is just one of the problems with online reviews, a lack of context. Others are dishonesty and paid-for puffery - annoyances that review sites such as Yelp, Amazon and Tripadvisor have been struggling to weed out for years. Such fake reviews and blackmail attempts threaten to undermine trust in the \"wisdom of crowds\" - reviews that many of us have come to rely on before we part with our hard-earned cash. Could better technology help restore confidence in the review system? The developers of a new mobile app from the UK, called Twizoo, say they have found a way of weeding out fake, paid-for and out-of-date reviews. The start-up, which is concentrating on restaurants initially, scrapes comments from Twitter, then collects and analyses them to provide what it claims is a more reliable stream of review data. Twizoo co-founder and algorithm writer Madeline Parra is clearly chasing industry leader, Yelp. \"We left 24 fake reviews on Yelp and all got through within a couple of hours,\" she says. \"But Twizoo expects users to have a full social media profile, tweeting about lots of different stuff, so it's a lot harder for a fake review to get through to us.\" Twizoo gives users a \"Twitter credibility score\" that has to be earned over time. Tweets that come from a brand new Twitter account are automatically discarded and several tweets coming in at the same time about one particular restaurant are also considered suspicious. That stops friends and family of the chef or restaurant owner influencing reviews, for example. \"After three months, tweets count half as much as they did before,\" says Ms Parra. \"On Yelp, if a restaurant got a one star review five years ago, it still counts against that restaurant. \"Because our volume [of tweets] is so high we want to give our users not what was awful five years ago, but what is great right now.\" Ms Parra also points out that tweets are more likely to be authentic because they are often sent between friends as recommendations. Yelp is incredibly protective of its \"secret sauce\" or more accurately its \"secret source code\" that makes up the algorithm used to weed out potentially false or over-enthusiastic five-star reviews. In fact, Yelp PR director Marco Bilello says only a very few people in the company know the exact formula. \"If everybody knew the ins and outs it would allow them to game the system,\" he tells the BBC, \"so we can't share that information. \"We believe in quality over quantity. That's why only 71% of our reviews that go through the recommendation software are eventually recommended.\" He did reveal that multiple Yelp reviews for the same restaurant coming from the same IP address are given extra scrutiny. And those reviews that seem biased - from the likes of competitors and disgruntled employees - are flagged. Yelp also has people on the ground in many locations and an investigative unit looking out for restaurants offering incentives to customers in return for five-star reviews. Amazon is also constantly tweaking its review system - star ratings now reflect how useful readers think a new review is and if it comes after a verified purchase. It also favours reviews that were written by a customer paying a standard price rather than a deeply discounted sale that may have only lasted days or even hours, but which may have resulted in an over-enthusiastic review. Amazon has also cracked down on dodgy reviews using the full force of the law. \"Since the beginning of 2015, we have brought lawsuits against over 1,000 defendants for reviews abuse,\" says Amazon spokesman Tom Cook, \"including both dishonest sellers and manufacturers who attempt to purchase fraudulent reviews, and the parties who provide and post those reviews.\" Jobs reviews site Glassdoor rejects about 5-10% of its submissions, suggesting that it is harder to fake reviews about occupations and specific work places, and much less lucrative. Tripadvisor chief executive Stephen Kaufer recently sent out a letter warning hotels and other businesses to be wary of \"optimisation companies\" promising to manipulate travel reviews for a fee, and then attempting to blackmail clients if they try to back out later. The more we know about the person leaving the review, the easier it should be to weed out the fakers. Walt Disney World gives customers a wristband that can be used to open hotel doors, pay for meals and souvenirs, and get into attractions. Disney knows exactly where you ate, what you ate, where you went, what you bought, who your favourite characters are, what rides you went on, and even what you look like. That's a goldmine of data against which reviews could be checked. But Georgios Zervas, assistant professor of marketing at Boston University, says: \"You could imagine doing that, but I think it would be quite creepy. \"And most people would find it annoying and an intrusion of their privacy rather than anything else.\" So despite being decades old, the concept of online reviews still has much further to go. One of the next big shifts is likely to be towards personalised reviews, delivered to you according to your age, location and, perhaps, experience. After all, a 16-year-old from Kansas and a 65-year-old from Maine might have very different opinions of a new lobster joint opening on the Las Vegas strip.

{"article": "A letter from an NHS England official to managers and GPs in one region suggests vulnerable practices could be left to \"wither by the system\". The note, seen by the BBC and Pulse magazine, claims NHS England is no longer able to \"continue supporting practices irrespective of their ability… to transform appropriately\". NHS England denied this was the case. A spokesman for the British Medical Association said it was \"unacceptable\" that some NHS managers believed that some GP practices would be left to close. A practice may be vulnerable due to: These are often practices rated by regulators as \"inadequate\" or \"requiring improvement\". It comes as media reports suggest much of a special fund to help struggling GP surgeries has not yet been handed out more than a year after it was unveiled. In June 2015, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced a £10m investment in GP practices in England which were deemed to be vulnerable. This was formally launched by NHS England later in the year. But last week, the medical publication Pulse reported that barely any of the fund had reached GPs.  Managers administering the fund in each area were said to be still identifying which vulnerable practices would qualify for the support. NHS England did not deny the report, though a source said the organisation was \"working through its local teams to ensure the funding available through the vulnerable practice programme is fully committed to named individual practices by the end of October\". Around 800 out of a total of 8,000 practices are deemed by NHS England to be in the vulnerable category. The criteria include a high number of patients per GP and an \"inadequate\" or \"requires improvement\" rating by the regulator, the CQC. NHS chiefs said the aim was to provide support for practices under pressure and to ensure patients had continued access to high quality care. In April 2016, NHS England announced an extra £16m for this year for a so-called \"practice resilience programme\", with another £24m in subsequent years. This pool of money was also aimed at shoring up struggling practices and was part of the GP Practice Forward View unveiled by the head of NHS England Simon Stevens. But a letter sent by Paul Twomey, medical director of the NHS England North Yorkshire and Humber area team, to local GPs and health officials in August suggests a harder line stance. In it he says: \"The message we need to communicate to general practice is the GP Practice Forward View must be about transformation and in that sense is not like a pilot.\" He goes on to express his belief that local health leaders will understand that \"vulnerable practices must either transform and deliver a quality service or be allowed to fail and wither by the system. We are no longer in a position to continue supporting practices irrespective of their willingness or ability as a provider to transform appropriately.\" Dr Richard Vautrey from the British Medical Association's GP committee said this approach was unacceptable. He called on the government to deliver the funding immediately and \"deter a mindset amongst managers that some GP practices can be allowed to disappear\". An NHS England spokesperson said: \"Rising patient demand is placing GPs under more pressure and that is why we are reversing the historic under-investment in general practice through a wide-ranging action plan, backed with half a billion pounds to support struggling practices. \"This includes a four-year, £40m programme for helping the GP surgeries facing the most difficulties and further practical measures to stabilise general practice for the future.\" References to surgeries and practices being \"allowed to fail\" comes at a sensitive time in the debate about the state of NHS primary care in England. There has been a steady stream of surgery closures and recruitment problems. GPs complain of a growing and sometimes intolerable workload. Last month 2,000 patients were left without a GP after a surgery was closed in Nottingham following an \"inadequate\" regulatory rating. They were advised to contact other surgeries nearby. In July, an Oxfordshire doctor's surgery announced it would close because it claimed changes to the national GP contract made it \"financially unviable\" and two partners were due to retire. This week, a North Yorkshire practice said it would close in the New Year. NHS England, while promising to boost the share of the overall NHS budget going to general practice, has encouraged doctors to pool resources by forming \"super-partnerships\" and federations. Improving out-of-hours access and working more closely with community health services are also on the task list for GP groups. The underlying message is that more efficient ways of delivering care at a time of stretched resources are required. NHS chiefs are under pressure to find efficiency savings and a multitude of smaller practices might not be the best use of resources. But the danger is that a process of modernisation and consolidation involving surgery closures could leave patients in some areas unable to get a GP appointment.", "question": "Some struggling GP surgeries in England will be allowed to fail and close , according to a leaked @placeholder .", "option_0": "suggests", "option_1": "group", "option_2": "document", "option_3": "body", "option_4": "published", "label": 2}
{"article": "Each time I’m unfortunate enough to find myself on this stretch, I’m struck by the symbolism: a road thick with fumes, overlooked by a factory working overtime to change that. From that vantage point it’s pretty hard not to root for Elon Musk’s company, or at the very least his vision for a cleaner, more sustainable energy industry. So far, he’s making incredible process. “Can you name any other car company, in the history of mankind, that has gotten to where Tesla has in 10 years?” asks Bob, a Tesla fan I meet after he pulled into the factory to charge his beloved car. I can’t, of course. Tesla's rise has been astronomical, bordering on absurd. Earlier this month, Tesla (albeit briefly) became the most valuable car company in the US, overtaking both Ford and General Motors. Two companies that, as well as being around for decades before Mr Musk was even born, sell vastly more cars than Tesla - and make far more money doing it. But that doesn't matter to investors, who have been falling over themselves to buy up Tesla’s stock, pushing it to a valuation of around $50bn - more than double what it should be, according to some. “The market’s giving them credit now for something they may or may not become,” said Brian Johnson, an automotive analyst at investment bank Barclays Capital. Elon’s Matrix Tesla Motors wasn’t founded by Elon Musk, but it for sure wouldn’t have survived without him. He doesn’t do many interviews, and declined to speak to me for this article. But that’s OK - because much like this country’s current president, Mr Musk does much of his thinking aloud, on Twitter. He uses it to speak directly to his fans, bypassing the necessity of using the press to get his message out. Often, I’m told, without warning his long-suffering communications team in advance. “Stormy weather in Shortville…” was one such tweet sent, gleefully, on 4 April as Tesla’s stock was riding high. He was having a risky dig at all those investors who sold off Tesla stock at the high price on the assumption they could buy it back again when the price dropped - skimming off the profit. It’s a tweet that might come back to bite him, predicted Mr Johnson, who draws parallels with  that iconic scene in the Matrix, where lead character Neo is given a choice of a red pill - and discover reality - or a blue pill, meaning blissful ignorance of the truth. “Investors are very happy to take the blue pill right now,” Mr Johnson said. “Especially when the stock has been going up like it has. \"A red pill view would lead you to a more conservative view of the valuation and not wanting to chase this rally too far.” He believes blue-pillers see Tesla’s headstart in battery manufacture, autonomy and other energy-related side projects as giving the company an unbeatable, perhaps even monopolistic advantage. But it’s far from certain. \"Tesla may be one of the finalists,” Mr Johnson said. \"But not the only one. You’re not talking about an industry structure that becomes iPhone-like. “We’re skeptical.” Pre-order pressure Just over a year ago, I stood and watched as Mr Musk took to a stage in Los Angeles and unveiled the Model 3, his most important product yet. His loyal fans whooped and hollered. Unlike the cars that came before it, the Model 3 was meant for people with slightly more modest incomes - $35,000, minus the incentives offered to people buying green vehicles. That night, he invited pre-orders - and he got them by the hundreds of thousands. Problem is, he doesn’t yet have a factory capable of building them quickly enough. Last year Tesla made 80,000 cars. General Motors made 10 million. Mr Musk has invested massively in streamlining and innovating the Tesla production line in Fremont, but it’s a huge task. “We have to see the proof that they can make the car, that it comes in at the price they promised, and that they can make a lot of them,” said Ashlee Vance, a Silicon Valley-based journalist and author of Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future. “Tesla has not done a good job of making lots of cars,” he added. \"If they are not able to get the Model 3 out quickly and then keep the factory coming along it becomes this huge cost sink for Tesla.” Keep on trucking Mr Musk is used to people telling him his ambitions are too great, or that his promises are recklessly optimistic. But over the years, since his fortune-making days as co-founder of PayPal, Mr Musk has developed an incredible ability to deflect missed targets with even bigger ones. As investors wait on Tesla to deliver on those Model 3s, for example, Mr Musk is busy tweeting about his planned September unveiling of a electric powered articulated lorry. And a pick-up truck. His Gigafactory - the largest factory floor in the world - is just getting operational, and already he is talking about building two or three more. Or perhaps even 100. What Mr Musk has created is a sense of excitement that has followers locked in admiration, and investors gripped by FOMO - the Fear Of Missing Out. What if Tesla becomes the next Apple, the next Amazon. What if it’s even bigger than that? Whatever your assessment of the valuation, there’s no questioning that the Cult of Elon is stronger than ever - and it adds billions to Tesla’s value. “This is almost all about the personality,” added Mr Vance. \"If you put almost any other executive in charge of this company there’s no way it has the same glow around it. \"Now that he’s hit his stride, more people have become believers in this guy. It’s almost impossible to separate the personality from the company.” ___________ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370", "question": "Some of my finest @placeholder takes place while driving , or rather crawling , along the 880 - a congested , polluted , almost - always - jammed monstrosity of a freeway that slithers past Tesla ’s car-making plant in Fremont , California .", "option_0": "taken", "option_1": "swearing", "option_2": "blasted", "option_3": "helped", "option_4": "whizzing", "label": 1}

Fans of the bard can expect to see Cleopatra in Egypt, Julius Caesar in the Roman Forum and Hamlet at Elsinore. Each 10-minute film will be screened along a two-mile stretch of the River Thames in London on 23-24 April 2016. \"It's a great marker just to look at how international Shakespeare's reach is, and quite how much he belongs to the world,\" said the project's mastermind, Dominic Dromgoole, artistic director at Shakespeare's Globe. He said the films would \"capture the essence\" of each play and act as a \"sharp, tangy introduction\" to people who knew nothing about it. During the next six months, the mini-movies will be shot, with noted Shakespearean actors - names yet to be announced - reciting speeches from the plays against the appropriate backdrop. Additional locations will include Shylock in Venice's Jewish Ghetto, Romeo and Juliet in Verona, Henry VIII and Wolsey at Hampton Court and King Lear and Cordelia on Dover beach. Films will include clips from the Globe's in-house productions and additional material shot at Shakespeare's birthplace at Stratford-upon-Avon. On the anniversary weekend in April, the films will be shown on 37 big screens erected between Westminster and Tower Bridges on a stretch dubbed The Complete Walk. \"We thought it was important that London was at the centre of it, as Shakespeare did most of his work here and those plays were first seen here,\" said Dromgoole, who steps down at the Globe in April after a decade at the helm. The public will be able to dip in to individual plays, or take in the full works. \"It would be wonderful if they sat and watched 10 minutes of every single one, but I can't imagine people doing that,\" Dromgoole said. The most far-flung piece of filming is likely to be for Antony and Cleopatra at the Pyramids in Egypt, although Dromgoole said he had been lobbied for The Tempest scenes to be shot in Barbados. \"A couple of actors suggested that they be flown out there for a day's filming. I'm not sure we're going to run to that.  It should probably be on an island between Tunis and Milan.\" The Â£500,000 project is being paid for by the Globe, with support from the British Council, the mayor of London and an anonymous donor.  It is hoped the films will also be presented in cities across the UK and internationally throughout 2016.

The changes, which are due to be introduced in 2018, are part of an attempt to reduce the cost of government by reducing the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and to make constituencies more equal in size. Chelmsford, Thurrock, Epping Forest, Hitchin and Harpenden, Waveney and West Suffolk remain the same but every other seat gains or loses a few wards from their neighbours. Three of the new look constituencies will straddle county boundaries. South West Norfolk which is currently held by Elizabeth Truss will take in Littleport in Cambridgeshire. Sir Oliver Heald's North East Herts seat will get a new name and inherit a couple of wards from South Cambridgeshire, while Chris Heaton-Harris will find himself representing not just Daventry but Lutterworth in Leicestershire as well. Other notable changes are that Witham will merge with Maldon while Clacton and Harwich are back in the same constituency again,. \"The rules that we work to are such that wide scale change is inevitable,\" said a spokesman for the boundary commission. \"These are just our initial thoughts and during the next 12 weeks we want people to take a look and tell us what they like and don't like about our proposals.\" The commission's aim is to make sure that every seat has an electorate of 74,769, give or take 5%. At the moment there are huge discrepancies: South Norfolk currently has an electorate of nearly 81,000, while Norwich North has just under 65,000 voters. This appears to be much less messy set of proposals than last time round, when a number of constituencies were going to cross county boundaries and we stood to lose between two and three MPs. This time, expect far less of an outcry. Priti Patel and John Whittingdale will have to fight it out to see who stands in the new Witham and Maldon seat but it is unlikely that either will fail to find a home especially when several of the region's Conservative MPs may well stand down at the next election (in fact, Sir Simon Burns in Chelmsford has already announced his intention to do so). But Labour will not be happy. Several seats that they have held in the past will become more rural under these proposals and therefore more likely to favour the Conservatives.

{"article": "Last week, Leicester fan Kevin Friend's removal from taking charge of title rivals Tottenham's game at Stoke had already sparked debate. Instead he will be in the middle of Manchester City's trip to Newcastle on Tuesday night. But how does a referee's home town, or who they support, affect which games they are actually allowed to officiate? Yes. And referees will not get appointed to the clubs they support. \"At the beginning of every season the referees' background information is audited,\" said Keith Hackett, the former head of Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the organisation that makes refereeing appointments for Premier League games. \"They complete a form that includes who they support, the history of if they've played the game and with the addresses where they are residing. \"That gives you a picture that comes into use when you're appointing. It's about ensuring, for example, you wouldn't appoint a Sheffield-based ref for a Sheffield team.\" Media playback is not supported on this device BBC Sport has not seen an official record of referee's allegiances, one of several factors considered when officials are selected for matches. Former Premier League referee Mark Halsey added: \"I was never able to referee Bolton because I lived there. If you lived in Leeds, you weren't going to referee Leeds United. \" PGMOL says the process behind referee selection is all about avoiding \"unnecessary extra external pressure and scrutiny on referees\" in what is an \"already a high pressure and demanding job\". It also says that where a referee lives is not a factor when referee appointments are considered. Halsey, a QPR fan, said he refereed his own team twice, before rules over announcing your allegiance came in. \"I lived 35 miles away from Loftus Road,\" he said. \"I refereed one win and one loss and I thought 'I can't do this again'. I never told them initially because it was back in the 1990s and things like that were only just starting to happen. \"I had to declare it because I felt like celebrating when they won. But once you've crossed the white line you're the ref and you always remained professional.\" Both Hackett and Halsey argue there are inconsistencies. Halsey has questioned why Friend was removed from refereeing a game involving Leicester's title rivals, while Michael Oliver, a Newcastle fan, was allowed to officiate in a game involving the Magpies' fellow relegation candidates Norwich City, when they lost to Crystal Palace last week. \"I just think they're making a rod for their own back,\" said Halsey. And Hackett has pointed towards inconsistencies around refereeing appointments when it comes to geography. Mike Dean, a Tranmere fan, was removed from refereeing the 2006 FA Cup final between Liverpool and West Ham because he lived in Wirral, which is part of Merseyside. Up until that point he had officiated one Liverpool game and two Everton games, but has not overseen either side since, despite moving to north Wales. Meanwhile, Anthony Taylor, an Altrincham fan who lives in the Greater Manchester borough of Trafford, is allowed to officiate matches involving Manchester City and Manchester United. \"If you're an Everton fan coming up to the FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United and you look at where Anthony Taylor lives, you suddenly go 'wow',\" said Hackett. The PGMOL says it makes appointments on a \"case by case basis\". Halsey and Hackett said they were not questioning the integrity of any referee, but questioned the consistency of the appointment process. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger criticised the decision to remove Friend from Tottenham's game against Stoke, after pressure from Spurs fans on social media. \"If you go that way, it becomes a nightmare every week to choose a referee for every single game. A dangerous precedent,\" he said. \"The solution is you don't look where they come from, who they support, and you put the best referees into the games.\" Speaking before Monday's 4-0 defeat by Spurs, Potters boss Mark Hughes added: \"Maybe the professional body that is in charge of referees thinks if any decision did go our way or against Tottenham, or vice-versa, then questions would be asked and they don't want to be put in that situation. \"My take on it is that the integrity of the referees should stop that happening or anybody having any doubts about that anyway, but it is what it is.\" Have you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

{"article": "Evidence suggested the destruction was \"carried out deliberately and with no military justification\", a new report by the human rights group found. It called for an independent and impartial investigation to be opened. Israel said the report made unfounded allegations and ignored Hamas' use of the buildings for military purposes. In a statement, the Israeli embassy in London said Amnesty should be investigating the Palestinian rocket attacks on Israeli civilians instead. The 50-day conflict in Gaza between Israel and militant groups led by Hamas left at least 2,189 Palestinians dead, including more than 1,486 civilians, according to the UN, and 11,000 injured. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers and six civilians were killed, with scores more wounded. During the last four days before a ceasefire came into effect, Israeli warplanes dropped large bombs on four buildings - the 12-storey Zafer 4 Tower, the 16-storey Italian Complex and the 13-storey al-Basha Tower in Gaza City, and the four-storey Municipal Commercial Centre in Rafah. Amnesty acknowledged that in all four cases no-one was killed because the Israeli military took measures to ensure residents left the building before they were destroyed - by telling some in telephone calls to evacuate, and also firing \"knock-on-the-roof\" warning missiles. But the group said scores of people from nearby buildings were injured and that hundreds were devastated to lose their homes, businesses and belongings. Amnesty said the Israeli authorities had provided no information as to why they destroyed the four buildings, other than the suggestion that one of the destroyed buildings housed a Hamas command centre and \"facilities linked to Palestinian militants\" in another. \"All the evidence we have shows this large-scale destruction was carried out deliberately and with no military justification,\" said Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Philip Luther. \"Both the facts on the ground and statements made by Israeli military spokespeople at the time indicate that the attacks were a collective punishment against the people of Gaza and were designed to destroy their already precarious livelihoods.\" Mr Luther added that even if the Israeli authorities believed part of a building was being used for military purposes, they had an \"obligation to choose means and methods of attack that would minimise harm to civilians and their property\". The Israeli embassy in London criticised Amnesty's report for choosing to \"focus on monetary losses to Palestinian civilians, rather than investigate the systematic and deliberate firing of rockets and mortars at Israel's civilian population\". The Israeli military did not intentionally target civilians or civilian property, complied with international law, was directed by military objectives, and abided by the principle of proportionality, the statement said. Releasing information that would disclose in detail the target of the strikes might jeopardise classified information and intelligence sources, it added. \"Third, and most blatantly, Amnesty ignores the clear evidence that Hamas systematically and deliberately used civilian infrastructure for military purposes.

{"article": "Not, to be clear, that the economy has ever been far from ministers' minds. However, Nicola Sturgeon's narrative is that Brexit will add considerably to the challenges facing Scotland and the UK. Requiring additional support. But, even in these post referendum days (EU, that is, not the 2014 version), there is still scope for a few familiar notes. And so Ms Sturgeon lambasted the Tories, characterising them as the right-wing enemies of her social democratic programme. Ruth Davidson, who leads said rightist cabal, smiled benignly from her new elevated status as the principal opposition party, accusing Ms Sturgeon of preparing to hike Scottish tax by failing to pass on UK Treasury concessions to higher rate payers. There was more to comfort those who like familiarity in politics. Labour's Kezia Dugdale, in an impassioned contribution, castigated the SNP for lacking the \"ambition\" to use Holyrood's new powers - which is, of course, code for adopting Labour's tax plans. Patrick Harvie of the Greens suggested more urgency on climate change targets and criticised a planned cut in Air Passenger Duty as a sop to wealthy flyers. And Willie Rennie of the Liberal Democrats complained that Ms Sturgeon had spent the summer bolstering the prospects for independence in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Up with which he was disinclined to put. On which point, a caveat. There was notably little about independence in this Programme for Government.  (To be fair, Mr Rennie recognised that:  his point was about the lead-up work.) Yes, Ms Sturgeon confirmed that there would be preparatory work done - consultation and the like - to get ready a Referendum Bill (2014 revisited, that is, not EU), should developing circumstances argue for such a move. But she insisted that the programme on the day was about the \"nuts and bolts\". The day job in short. Ms Sturgeon has always argued that she and her ministerial team were focused upon that day job. She has always dismissed the argument that they were distracted, post Brexit vote, by further thoughts of independence. But her renewed and strenuous emphasis upon this fact would suggest, to this observer at least, that the FM suspects that the endlessly repeated opposition complaints on this point may be having an effect. Now to economic growth. This, to be absolutely clear, is not a new focus for the FM. It was, indeed, the subject of her very first major speech after attaining the top office at Holyrood - when she assured a business audience that an egalitarian approach would be matched by an emphasis on bolstering the economy. Business leaders liked the sound of that. But some fret that the action from Ministers does not always match the tenor of those promises.  Most particularly, they want further intervention to prevent business rates in Scotland from presenting a significant hurdle. They witness and applaud the small business rates bonus. But they are watching out with care and attention for the outcome of a review of business rates more generally, noted by Ms Sturgeon in her statement. But, again, to confirm, Ms Sturgeon has prioritised the economy from the outset, arguing that it is only through productive development that one can find the cash for services. She has now made two further interventions on this scheme.  On Friday, she announced the creation of an SNP Growth Commission, to be headed by former MSP Andrew Wilson with other names to come. I am assured that those other names will include SNP stalwarts who also believe that Scotland needs to prioritise economic growth alongside social cohesion. Further, today, she announced a Scottish Growth Scheme. This would be worth Â£500m which would be used to guarantee bank loans when companies have struggled to obtain finance. In certain circumstances, there could be direct lending. In all cases, companies would require to meet key criteria. Once again, this focuses upon growth. But, as opposition parties are already commenting, it potentially contains a constitutional dimension. These loan guarantees would not count as part of the Scottish government's discretionary current spending budget. If agreed, they would go on the books as Annually Managed Expenditure which generally covers such matters as continuing pension liabilities. That would require sanction from two sources. One, MSPs would have to agree to give ministers control over these funding vehicles, avoiding individual companies having to face the invidious task of setting out their detailed balance sheets before a Holyrood committee. But, secondly, the new scheme would require UK Treasury sanction. Ms Sturgeon fired the first shot by voicing the hope that there would be no objection from that quarter.

{"article": "The Bevan Foundation outlined what it thinks Wales' economic priorities should be, following an invitation for views from the Welsh Government. They include all public sector employers paying workers the voluntary Living Wage within a year. The Welsh Government said it will consider the report. In October it was announced the UK voluntary Living Wage was to rise to Â£8.45 per hour. The foundation's submission said despite Wales' good performance \"some major challenges remain.\" These are highlighted as a shortage of jobs in some part of the country. For example Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Rhondda Cynon Taff have barely half the number of jobs per head of working-age population compared with the UK average. The report said where there has been employment growth, much of the increase has been in self-employment, part-time working and temporary jobs. The report said wages, especially low wages, have been stagnant over the last six years with some parts of Wales experiencing a decrease in earnings. In Blaenau Gwent earnings have not kept up with inflation, meaning the average worker is more than Â£70 a week worse off than in 2002. Brexit was said to pose a new challenge, with concerns about the consequences for Wales' 500 foreign-owned companies and its Â£1 billion of exports each quarter. The Bevan Foundation recommends that the Welsh Government's economic policies should promote \"inclusive growth\". This involves combining the aim of growing prosperity, such as increasing employment, with the aim of increasing inclusion, such as addressing low wages. The report said: \"The Welsh Government has made good progress in encouraging the adoption of the voluntary Living Wage in the public sector, including the NHS, further education colleges and some local authorities.\" But it adds that \"much more could be done to increase take-up.\" The foundation calls on the Welsh Government to require all public sector employers to pay the voluntary Living Wage to workers within a year, and to sub-contractors by 2019.

{"article": "The private Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 47.1 from 47.8 in July. A figure below 50 indicates contraction. The data triggered another sell off in Chinese shares, which ended the day down more than 4%. The factory data is likely to compound global worries that the Chinese economy is set for a continued slowdown. Investors are growing increasingly concerned, as the Shanghai Composite index is now down 12% this week. European markets were also lower again on Friday, with the UK's FTSE 100, Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 all down about 1.3% in mid-afternoon trading, while the Dow Jones in the US opened down almost 1%. Friday's factory output reading was the lowest since March 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis, and the sixth consecutive below the 50-point level. The Caixin flash PMI is the earliest economic measure of the Chinese economy to be released each month and is closely watched for clues on how growth is faring. Earlier in August, China's official economic growth data showed a further slowdown in the past quarter, expanding 7% compared to a year earlier, its slowest pace since 2009. In 2014, China's economy grew at its slowest pace since 1990. It expanded by 7.4%, missing its annual growth target of 7.5% for the first time in 15 years. Since June 2015, stock exchanges on the mainland have seen extreme volatility, undermining investor confidence and leading to government intervention. Nicholas Teo, market analyst with CMC markets, warned that China's slumping economy could dash hopes for a global recovery. \"China today is no longer just the 'factory' of the world. It is an important consumer of the world's products and services. Many companies and industries depend on the Chinese consumers who are now 'disadvantaged' in purchasing power,\" he said. \"So when it sneezes', many around the globe may just catch a cold.\" Greater China economist Julia Wang at HSBC warned that economic recovery continued to lose momentum with \"further policy-easing measures, from monetary easing to fiscal support needed\". But other analysts warned against overreacting to the current situation. AMP Capital's chief economist Shane Oliver described the situation as a \"global share market correction\", pointing out that emerging markets were \"arguably much stronger than in 1997-98, with stronger current account balances and higher foreign exchange reserves\". Beijing has struggled to stabilise the country's stock markets, which have fallen sharply since mid-June. Earlier this month, the central bank stunned global markets by taking steps to devalue the country's currency, the yuan, allowing it more freedom to fluctuate in line with market developments.

{"article": "Down on the Croisette, the last bow ties will shortly be tied, the last bottles of Rosé are being uncorked and the fans are preparing to take their last celebrity selfies. After 11 days of film, glamour, sun and canapés, the awards will be handed out and we will finally discover what film will receive the coveted Palme d'Or. This was the year we learned that Lady Gaga was to play Cilla Black (until she wasn't), that Shia LaBeouf is to play John McEnroe (his backhand, he told me, was \"getting there\"), and that George Clooney has no love for Donald Trump. It was also the year that Woody Allen faced a perfect storm of negative publicity, just for agreeing to open the festival with his latest period confection. Up on the screen, Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn created a storm of his own with The Neon Demon, a dark satire on fame whose scenes of necrophilia and cannibalism prompted boos and walk-outs. There were boos too for Olivier Assayas's Personal Shopper, which saw Kristen Stewart ride a moped, take the Eurostar and bare her breasts in her quest to deliver haute couture and communicate with her dead brother at the same time. Festival favourites Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne were not spared criticism either for The Unknown Girl, an archetypal slice of Belgian miserabilism spliced with a whodunit plot oddly reminiscent of Dick Van Dyke's 90s TV show Diagnosis: Murder. Another festival stalwart had better fortune, as our own Ken Loach proved he still can prick our collective consciences with the heartfelt and indignant I, Daniel Blake. Away from the main competition, Steven Spielberg brought charm, effects and a little bit of tedium to the festival with The BFG, an adaptation of the Roald Dahl story that, flatulent corgis apart, was something of a slog. The same could be said of Money Monster, despite all the Tinseltown glamour it imported in the form of Clooney, Julia Roberts and director Jodie Foster. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling were also on hand to show their bromantic relationship in The Nice Guys didn't end when the cameras stopped turning. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, meanwhile, reunited to show what Thelma and Louise might look like now if they hadn't (spoiler alert) driven that car into that ravine. So what film will George Miller and his competition jury award the Palme d'Or? If you listen to the critics, Toni Erdmann has a decent shot. This German comedy about a divorcé who goes to extreme lengths to spend time with his daughter earned glowing reviews, despite running for a posterior-numbing two hours and 42 minutes. Good buzz is also swirling around Brazilian film Aquarius, in which Sonia Braga plays a woman trying to save her beloved home from rapacious property developers. Romanian titles Sieranevada and Graduation are serious contenders too - as, perhaps, are Andrea Arnold's American Honey and the US civil rights drama Loving.

{"article": "David Cameron has said strikes should not be lawful unless a minimum number of union members vote in a ballot. Plans for a \"turnout threshold\" will be in the party's election manifesto. But Unite boss Len McCluskey said this would \"oppress the people and remove their freedoms\". He added: \"Can we respect it? It ain't going to happen.\" Under current law, a strike can take place if it is backed by a simple majority of those balloted. But Conservative MPs have questioned the legitimacy of industrial action where fewer than half of total eligible members support it in a vote. London Mayor Boris Johnson has called for strikes to be banned unless 50% of staff in a workplace take part in a ballot. Although Mr Cameron has not specified a figure, he has said it is \"time to legislate\" to stop \"damaging\" strikes in \"core\" public services affecting health, transport, fire services or schools and the manifesto is expected to include proposals for a 40% threshold. But in a speech to union lawyers in London, Mr McCluskey said the right to strike was \"hanging by a thread\" and had to be vigorously defended. \"Should there be a Conservative majority in May, there will be a new attack on trade union rights and democracy. \"The bar for a strike ballot will be raised to a level which hardly any MPs would get over in their own constituencies, by a government which has refused our requests to use modern, more effective balloting methods. \"When the law is misguided, when it oppresses the people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? \"I am not really posing the question. I'm giving you the answer. It ain't going to happen.\" Unions have pointed out that only 15 of 303 Conservative MPs elected to Parliament in 2010 received more than 40% of the vote. Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour's largest financial backer, said the time had come to ask whether unions could stay within the law any longer while continuing to mount a \"decent defence\" against abuse of workplace rights. Such are Unite's concerns, he claimed, that the union's executive is recommending to members that the words \"so far as may be lawful\" are removed from its constitution. \"This proposed change in the constitution of the biggest union on these isles marks the sorry place we have reached in our national democracy. These words will go not because we are anarchists, not because we are suddenly planning a bank robbery. \"But because we have to ask ourselves the question, can we any longer make that commitment to, under any and all circumstances, stick within the law as it stands? \"Unite remains determined to operate ever more effectively within the law, even when that law is an ass and ill-serves our people. \"But restricting the right to strike, attacking the capacity for trade unions to organise and conduct our own business in line with our own rules, belong to last century's consensus.\" The Lib Dems have blocked any moves to change the law to make it harder to strike. Speaking in Parliament last July, Mr Cameron said \"the time has come to look at setting thresholds in strike ballots\", citing the example of a walkout by a teaching union which he said had the support of fewer than 30% of its members in a ballot. \"It is time to legislate and it will be in the Conservative manifesto.\"", "question": "The @placeholder of the Unite union has said he will not \" respect \" any law passed by a future Conservative government tightening the rules on strike ballots .", "option_0": "collapse", "option_1": "body", "option_2": "operator", "option_3": "head", "option_4": "future", "label": 3}
{"article": "They describe a rare but fatal case of what they are now calling \"bagpipe lung\" in a 61-year-old patient. The deceased man is thought to have developed a bad reaction to mould and fungi lurking inside the moist interior of his bagpipes. Doctors are urging other musicians to be extra hygienic. They say instruments should be cleaned regularly to prevent the build-up of yeast and other harmful pathogens. And any player who gets breathless and develops a cough should consider whether their symptoms might be caused by their music practice. There have been a couple of other documented reports of similar lung problems in saxophone and trombone players. Thankfully, in these cases the cause was identified early and the patients recovered. The lung damage the doctors describe happens when the body's immune system goes into overdrive. The inhaled pathogens trigger inflammation and left unchecked, this causes progressive and irreversible scarring. Doctors at the Wythenshawe Hospital said they had a hunch that the man's bagpipes might be the cause of his problems. The man was a keen piper, practising his music every day. He had been unwell for a number of years, with the exception of a few months when he travelled abroad and left his bagpipes at home. The doctors sent his bagpipes to the laboratory to check if their hunch was right. When the lab report came back it revealed that the instrument was riddled with damp-loving mould and fungi - the types that doctors know can cause lung problems. The damage that had already occurred to the man's lungs was irreversible. His condition deteriorated and he died some weeks later. Dr Jenny King, a member of the Wythenshawe team who had treated the man, said: \"Sadly, in his case, the damage was fatal. \"If you can diagnose these problems early and remove the trigger then they can be treated and the prognosis is really good. \"These organisms are around in the air, but they're not usually at a high enough level to cause problems. You do sometimes see this type of lung problem in people who work on farms and are exposed to lots of mouldy hay.\" Andrew Bova works at the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and is an accomplished bagpiper. He advised: \"Certainly, when it comes to cleaning a woodwind instrument I would say give it a swab after every time you play. \"The moisture can sit in the nooks and crannies and you don't want that. Moisture can damage the wood so we swab to protect the instrument as much as anything.\" He uses brushes to clean his and says he gives the blowpipe a thorough rinse out with hot water every six months to get rid of any problems. \"If you have a sheepskin bag, I was told that I should wash it out with hot water and bleach every year. That should get all the germs killed and prolong the life of your instrument. \"Of course, most people today tend to play synthetic bags. I tell my players that they can unzip those to let the bag dry out.\" Kevin Lamb, chairman of the Windband Association, said all instruments were cleanable.", "question": "Trumpeters , saxophonists and pipers beware - playing a wind instrument could damage your lungs , UK doctors warn in the @placeholder Thorax .", "option_0": "journal", "option_1": "area", "option_2": "water", "option_3": "country", "option_4": "sea", "label": 0}

{"article": "Dr Steve McCabe, economist at Birmingham City University, said signs of recovery could be measured by wages, unemployment and the Gross Value Added (GVA). The median annual gross pay for Birmingham's full time workers is currently £28,504, which is higher than the £27,872 median across England, according to the Office for National statistics. The percentage of the city's 16 to 65-year-olds claiming job seekers allowance was 5.8% in 2008 and rose to 7.5% in 2012. It is now down to 3.3% - but this is more than double the percentage for England at 1.2% according to ONS figures out this week. The GVA gives a value for the amount of goods and services produced, less the cost of all inputs and raw materials. Birmingham's Real GVA for 2009 was £21,117 per head, it dropped to £20,594 in 2012 and the provisional figure for 2014 was £21,093. So it is not quite back up to its former productivity. Birmingham falls behind Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Nottingham in terms of latest GVA figures. But it is ahead of Tyneside and Sheffield. \"Birmingham is recovering but more slowly than, for example, Manchester,\" said Mr McCabe. Figures aside, Mr McCabe thinks Birmingham is suffering from an identity crisis following the recession. \"As a city that is trying to develop itself as a place of post-industrialism, Birmingham has image problems and, perhaps lacks the assertiveness of other UK cities.\" But Paul Bunce, commercial manager at hotel and meeting centre Conference Aston, believes Birmingham's image has never been better. \"People are finally seeing Birmingham as a destination for business. \"The amount of organisations using Birmingham as a meeting place is the highest I've seen it in 10 years. \"Thanks to developments like Grand Central shopping centre people are extending their stays to go shopping and sight seeing.\" Opus restaurant owner Ann Tonks said her businesses were \"a really interesting bellwether for what's going on in the city.\" \"We had a real leap in 2014 - I'm talking double figures in the number of people coming through the doors and private dining bookings for months in advance. \"In the last four or five years in the Colmore business district the scene has exploded. \"The number of independent operations we have shows things are booming. \"The more successful Birmingham is the more competition there is.\" But Birmingham's \"success\" has not been without its problems. An extension to the Midland Metro tram network through the city was delayed by several weeks, with technical issues with underground cabling being blamed. It was also revealed the network has not made a profit since it was opened in 1999, in fact it has lost £34m since. Bosses are hopeful the planned extensions to Edgbaston and Centenary Square will bring in nine million passengers per year by 2026. It is currently used by about five million. And, less than two years after its opening, hours at the Library of Birmingham were cut by nearly half to save money. Birmingham has gone from being that place you moved to if you had to - to the first choice for people leaving London for a better way of life. It's an amazing turnaround and it's something that the city has had to work hard to achieve. Several landmark projects have boosted Birmingham's fortunes, including the Bullring shopping centre more than a decade ago and more recently the revamp of New Street station. Proof that both have made a big different can easily be seen with the regeneration that's happened since they were first talked about. Once derelict sites close to the city centre have either been developed or are now prime development sites. Now with trams passing through the city's streets too, Birmingham's rise from recession really has turned into a major achievement. Drab to fab in less than a decade! Steve Brittan was president of the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce in 2012/2013. He said: \"Birmingham was in a mess then as the whole country was after the recession. The chamber wasn't on a good footing. We were haemorrhaging members and subsequently money. \"Then the Greater Birmingham and Solihull LEP came along and we established a very good relationship with Birmingham City Council to promote the city as the go to place for business. \"Since then Birmingham and the chamber have completely turned around.\" Paul Faulkner, chief executive of Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce, said: \"This is truly a period of renaissance for Greater Birmingham. \"As well as all of the amazing regeneration work being undertaken, we have the exciting prospect of further powers being devolved from Whitehall. \"And the region is unifying from the Black Country to Coventry and Warwickshire with the creation of the West Midlands Combined Authority. \"With the government re-affirming its commitment to HS2 and further devolved powers for the region, there cannot be a more optimistic and promising era for this region.\" Mr McCabe said: \"Birmingham has the youngest population of any city in Europe so what it really needs to be doing is creating jobs faster than we are losing them. \"The way Birmingham looks, the environment has improved. It has got over the recession. But I still think the wounds are not too far beneath the surface.\" We asked you to choose from three of Your Questions and this was the most popular.

{"article": "When we arrived in darkness all was calm and quiet. We were greeted courteously by men carrying copies of the US constitution, who told us they were unarmed. They had draped the US flag over a sign at the entrance to the wildlife refuge and they offered us a cup of coffee. The guards told us that the armed men inside were not taking visitors at present but would be happy to come out and meet the media face to face in the morning. One of the men tried to give me a small US Fish and Wildlife Service sign from the building \"as a souvenir\". \"It's mine,\" he said, \"I paid for it,\" making a reference to his taxes. A short distance away, down a slope in the darkness, sat the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge itself, a collection of more than a dozen buildings which serves as the headquarters for a sanctuary established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908. A spot popular with birdwatchers keen to catch a glimpse of a greater sandhill crane may seem an improbable symbol of oppression but the men here insist the federal government has overreached its authority and has no right to this land. The refuge abuts property owned by the two men whose incarceration sparked this whole protest, Dwight Hammond and his son Steven. Their lawyer told the BBC that the Hammonds, who have already served time in prison for setting fires which spread to public land, had travelled to California on Sunday to hand themselves in after federal prosecutors won an appeal that resulted in lengthier jail terms. Publicly they have distanced themselves from the action, taken by people who are not neighbours or locals. But some people in the community around the town of Burns say while they do not approve of the methods, they are in tune with the sentiment. Back at the bird reserve, the mood changed slightly as the day dawned, the birds started singing and the winter sun struggled to pierce the hazy clouds. The media were now at the gate in force and the men there were more reluctant to talk. \"We need to stick to the narrative,\" one told us as he explained why we needed to wait for their leader Ammon Bundy. Down a slight hill, we could now see the headquarters clearly, the red roofs of the sheds standing out against the snow. Several dark-clad figures moved around in the complex. At the top of a metal observation tower two men surveyed the surroundings. There was not much for them to see apart from satellite trucks, camera crews and a solitary, unexplained drone. For miles around there was no sign at all of any law enforcement officers although the word in Burns, some 30 minutes away, is that the hotels are packed with FBI agents. Critics of this occupation are putting pressure on the federal authorities to enforce the law and end it. They have accused the occupiers of this building of being domestic terrorists, using force to impose their will. Those involved insist they are patriots and they claim they have the law on their side. The US constitution prohibits the federal government from owning this land, they say. When Mr Bundy emerged to speak to the media he refused to tell me how many people were inside the bird sanctuary or how many were armed but, after the news conference, camera crews were given a limited tour of the site. Several children also came along although the militia men said the youngsters were visitors who were not staying on the site. We were told we would not be shown anything relating to \"operational security\" or anything that would \"put lives at risk\" and, indeed, we were kept away from any weapons on the site. A number of US government vehicles sat in the car park, covered in snow. We were not allowed into most of the buildings and saw no more than a dozen men and one woman inside. We were taken into a building where one of the protestors said he had been sleeping. It appeared to be a gym for the federal employees who usually manage this land. There were cans of chicken noodle soup, oranges, apples and other food. Through a glass window we could see a man and a woman cooking food in a kitchen. The site appeared to be in good condition. Not all of the men here were keen to talk but those who were have urged supporters to take up arms and join them to assert the rights of ranchers in the American west, rights which they say have been trampled by a federal government over-reaching its authority. They say they are prepared to stay here for years to make that point and, so far, there is no sign at all of them leaving or being forced from this land.

Seven staff were suspended after secret filming by the BBC Panorama programme. Justice Secretary Michael Gove told the House of Commons he would be meeting with the firm this week to discuss the allegations. He said the alleged assaults would be treated with the \"utmost seriousness\" but it would be \"quite wrong\" to make a \"blanket allegation\" against G4S, pointing out that other institutions which it operated did a \"good job\". Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham has said if the claims are true, G4S should be stripped of its contract to run Medway and other STCs. The allegations - uncovered by Panorama - involve unnecessary force, foul language and a cover-up. The claims relate to 10 boys aged 14 to 17. The programme is due to be broadcast later. Last week, G4S wrote to the BBC to try to stop broadcast of the footage, arguing filming was unauthorised and illegal. However, Paul Cook of G4S said he was \"shocked and appalled\" and was supporting a police investigation. An Ofsted inspection report in September 2014 into Medway rated it as \"good with some outstanding features\". Inspectors said the centre was \"orderly\" and \"calm\" and young people were said to feel safe. The centre holds 56 children, mainly boys, aged 12 to 17.

The local units of Standard Chartered and UBS, Southeast Asia's biggest lender DBS and Falcon Bank were all found to have \"lapses and weaknesses in anti-money laundering controls\". Standard Chartered, DBS and UBS said they were cooperating with authorities. Falcon Bank was not immediately available for comment. Malaysia 'to co-operate' with 1MDB probe The US v The Wolf of Wall Street The case that's riveted Malaysia Singapore prosecutors have also seized $177m (Â£134m) in assets linked to 1MDB, half of which belong to a Malaysian financier facing many of the fraud allegations. The US government said on Wednesday that $3.5bn was \"misappropriated\" from 1MDB and that \"the Malaysian people were defrauded on an enormous scale\". US prosecutors are now looking to seize $1bn in assets linked to 1MDB, which includes plush properties in New York and Los Angeles and a private jet. Mr Najib and 1MDB have consistently denied any wrongdoing. Singapore is one of several global authorities investigating alleged fraud at 1MDB, which was set up by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009. The country's financial regulator said in a statement on Thursday investigations into 1MDB began in March 2015. \"They revealed extensive layering of transactions and subterfuge aimed at disguising the nature of certain activities and fund flows,\" the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said. \"In some instances, shell or unauthorised companies domiciled in various jurisdictions were used to conceal the true beneficiaries of the funds.\" \"Standard Chartered takes financial crime compliance very seriously,\" a spokesperson told the BBC. \"We have strengthened our anti-money laundering controls and processes and will continue to play an active role in the fight against financial crime.\" \"Egregious financial crime is highly sophisticated and intentionally designed to evade systems and controls,\" a DBS spokesperson said. \"We take our anti-money laundering obligations seriously\". UBS also said it was constantly enhancing its anti-money laundering processes. \"In this case, UBS self-reported the suspicious transactions and is working closely with regulators to address this matter,\" a spokesperson for the bank told the BBC. Singapore is trying to maintain its reputation as a corruption-free international finance and banking hub and is taking a stern stance towards any illicit fund flows. Swiss bank BSI was kicked out of the city in May for \"serious breaches\" of Singapore's anti-money laundering rules in its business dealings with 1MDB. Switzerland has since launched a criminal investigation into the private bank.

{"article": "It found a third of businesses, from a sample of 400, saw rising volumes of activity over the winter months. However, nearly as many saw a fall. There was a net 10 percentage point gap in the number of firms around Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire expecting growth in volumes over the next six months. Exports across the Scottish private sector stalled between December and February, despite help from the weaker pound. Capital investment dropped markedly since autumn, according to the survey. Some 21% of firms reported that new capital investment rose during the winter months, while 29% said it fell. That net score, of a negative eight percentage points, contrasts with a positive 24 point gap between investment risers and fallers in the previous quarter of 2016. The quarterly Royal Bank business monitor, carried out by the Fraser of Allander Institute at Strathclyde University, found inflation pressures were growing on firms, and expected to intensify during this year. The sector with the strongest showing over winter were financial and business services. The most positive outlook was found among tourism firms and those in transport and communications, although those sectors also reported that cost pressures were stronger than in other areas of the economy. Stephen Boyle, chief economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, said growth looked \"pretty tepid\", while the main development was rising inflation. \"A combination of the weaker pound, the National Living Wage and a rise in energy prices is pushing up firms' input costs,\" he said. \"That's starting to show in consumer price inflation and will continue to build over the next few months. How consumers and businesses respond will be central to determining economic performance in 2017.\" Prof Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said: \"Despite concerns about inflation picking up, firms expect growth in 2017 to be marginally more positive than 2016. \"However, the increase in uncertainty caused by the triggering of Article 50 and the prospects of a second independence referendum will act as a headwind for many businesses.\"", "question": "Businesses in north east Scotland are preparing for an upturn from the oil and @placeholder slump of the past two years , according to a survey for the Royal Bank of Scotland .", "option_0": "gas", "option_1": "posted", "option_2": "fuelling", "option_3": "reached", "option_4": "revolutionise", "label": 0}

A penalty try and Andreu's second after the break, along with nine points from the boot of Dan Carter, consigned the Tigers to a fourth consecutive defeat. Leicester's European season will conclude against Glasgow on Saturday. The Scottish club could still progress from Pool 1 should they win at Welford Road, with Munster already assured of their place in the last eight. Aaron Mauger has now lost both of his games in charge of Tigers since becoming interim director of rugby following Richard Cockerill's sacking. And there were few positives to take from a careless performance against a team that are struggling in the bottom half of the French league. Chauveau set Racing on their way with a finish after the hosts' pack had pinned Leicester on their own line and Andreu ran in under the posts when he picked up Matt Smith's stray pass. Freddie Burns' penalty gave Tigers their only points of the match but the visitors' night was summed up when Mathew Tait fumbled Carter's missed penalty and knocked on behind his own posts - handing Racing a penalty scrum that allowed Grobler to sneak over. Tigers continued to wither under the power of the Parisian club's pack and Will Evans conceded a penalty try when he tackled a driving maul - the flanker was sin-binned for his contribution. With Racing losing Antonie Claassen to a yellow card, Dan Cole thought he had scored for Leicester, but the television match official was unable to determine if the ball had been touched down. And the Premiership side's misery was compounded late on when Andreu finished a slick move in the corner. Leicester director of rugby Aaron Mauger: \"It was frustrating and disappointing.

{"article": "To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of election blind dates for the general election campaign. Businessman Peter Stringfellow, who runs a gentleman's club in London, is a Conservative Party supporter, while historian, feminist and TV presenter Mary Beard says she is left-wing and proud. They went into the meal without knowing who they would be meeting. But did they get on? Describe yourself: I'm Mary Beard and I am a professor of classics at the University of Cambridge. My day-job is working on Roman history and ancient Roman history. A few years ago now, I started doing Roman documentaries on both BBC Two and BBC One. It's got my face out there - for better or worse. Political beliefs: I would summarise my politics very simply as the maverick left and proud. How was your date?: I had a good time. He's an engaging old rogue. He listens. I wish I'd landed a few more killer blows against some of the things on which we disagreed. And I do suspect that some of my friends will think that I didn't give him a hard enough time on the feminism. First impression: I was so expecting it to be [businessman] James Dyson for some reason. I had to do a triple take and I thought \"Oh, it's Peter Stringfellow, isn't it?\" What did you talk about?: We talked about Tories, Jeremy Corbyn, aspiration and taxes. What did you agree on?: We were both very strong Remainers and think that the EU referendum result is seriously worrying. Both of us want to live in a global world. Biggest row: Peter thinks that high taxation somehow stamps on aspiration. He does seem to be quite committed to the idea that there is a financial incentive to what a lot of people do. The current social exclusion in this country is so unfair that if higher taxation could solve that, surely that's a good thing? Did you convince him on anything?: I thought the place I made the best hit actually was on taxation because I didn't think that Peter had a very good answer to the absolute blatant unfairness of social division. I think I did rather better on taxation than I did on the feminist issues. I think he's rather more practised at dealing with that actually. What about feminism?: We had a long head-to-head without much engagement about feminism, about what women want to do, and how that fits with having them take their clothes off. I think when I meet those arguments I tend to become a bit donnish, perhaps slightly finger-wagging. Will you go to his club?: I haven't ever been to a club where women take their clothes off. I've quite strong views about that but I've never seen it. If Peter follows up the invitation I shall go. I shall attend with some trepidation but I owe it to him to go and see what I criticised. Best thing: The best thing is that he was prepared to listen and engage and take the argument seriously. Worst thing: I don't think his justification about women's aspirations and [his club] Stringfellows adds up for me. Describe him in three words: Elegant, intelligent rogue. Marks out of 10: Oh, I can't answer that in a simple number because it depends on the criteria, right? Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 BST on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel. Friday's election blind date will be Conservative John Whittingdale and Labour's Jess Phillips. Describe yourself: My name's Peter Stringfellow. Actually I'm Peter James Stringfellow. Peter J Stringfellow is how I sign my name. Not Pete. Never Pete. I suppose I'm best known as probably the night club guy. \"Hey aren't you in night clubs or something?\" Yeah, that's me. Political beliefs: I'm now a Conservative, providing the Conservatives are good for Great Britain and continue to be aspirational. How was your date?: She was very pleasant, very sweet and very warm, and right from the off I knew we were all right. I enjoyed her company. First impression: The minute I saw Mary, I was very pleased, because I'm a bit of history buff myself. The first thing I wanted to ask her about was the books on Rome. What did you disagree on?: Mary got a bit hung up about exploitation [of women]. She didn't use that word, but that's basically what she was trying to say. It's an old-fashioned attitude, we all exploit each other. Not in a nasty way. We all rely on each other to make our world spin around. Footballers earn Â£250,000-a-week. Are they being exploited, because some owners are making billions out of the actual football? No, not really. Everyone's happy, everybody's working and that's the same as my world. Did she convince you on anything?: Mary convinced me of nothing - except I like her, but I knew I would like her the minute I walked in the cafe and saw her. Did she change my views? Give her a break, we were only there for 40 minutes or something. But that's OK, I still liked her for herself. Did anything surprise you?: Close-up she's a very attractive woman. I would say, she doesn't really care that much about her cosmetic appearance. Of course, she cares, but not cosmetically. And I think she carries that as a banner. Look at my eyes, I don't care about the way I look. Having said all that, she can't help it. She's a very nice, soft, warm, [woman] and I find it attractive. Three words to describe her: Soft, smart and clever. Marks out of 10: Nine out of 10. I thought it was great. She was lovely.

{"article": "\"The steering is entirely drive-by-wire, it's computer controlled,\" says Holly as we hurtle around the campus of Stanford University in a weird and wonderful contraption which would not seem out of place in a Mad Max movie. \"It's all electronic - there's no mechanical connection so we can programme it to do pretty much what we want.\" Holly works at Stanford's Center for Automotive Research, based in Palo Alto, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley. The machine she's driving is known as the X1. It looks like a cross between a car and a beach buggy, with half an electronics laboratory thrown in. There's no bodywork, just a frame made out of metal tubes. We sit in bucket seats, held in by race harnesses. In front, you can see every twitch of the chunky red suspension springs as the large alloy wheels bounce over Stanford's many potholes. The whole thing is festooned with wiring, switches and important-looking electronic gadgets. The X1 is a test-bed for the kind of technology which might seem exotic today, but which may eventually be commonplace. It's one of a number of vehicles created by the organisation which is on the front line of research into electronic systems that are designed initially to help human drivers, but may ultimately replace them altogether. Many of our cars are increasingly driven by artificial intelligence - they have engine management systems, computers which are designed to make sure the engine runs as efficiently as possible. ABS detects when a driver has used the brakes too violently and prevents the wheels from locking up, and traction control can stop the wheels from spinning uselessly when the driver accelerates in slippery conditions. For the moment, the driver remains in charge, but research into driverless cars or \"vehicle autonomy\" as it's known in the industry, is already well advanced. Internet giant Google has actually been operating a fleet of self-driving cars on the streets of California for some time, but other multinationals such as Volkswagen, Bosch, General Motors and Mercedes are also working on autonomous systems. As a result, Silicon Valley is increasingly becoming a new hub for automotive engineering. In February, Japanese carmaker Nissan became the latest manufacturer to set up a research office in the region, specifically to focus on developing self-driving technologies. But why do we actually need driverless cars? According to the executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford, Sven Beiker, a key aspect is safety. \"We're very interested in what the driver is good at, and what the computer is better at doing, and we're working on the handover between the driver and the vehicle,\" he says. \"So what we're looking at is when the driver gets him or herself into trouble, as often happens when driving too fast, the vehicle could take over.\" But safety is just one aspect. Driverless vehicles could also become a vital tool for cutting congestion. \"If you look at a highway, even at rush hour times, only about 20-25% of the surface area is actually occupied by vehicles,\" says Mr Beiker. \"We need a lot of space around the car in order to manoeuvre but if you have a lot of top-notch sensors and control systems, you can probably get those vehicles much closer together.\" If those cars could communicate with one another as well they would also be able to identify traffic hotspots and avoid them. But there is another way in which self-driving vehicles could cut congestion. That would be to make it easier for people to rent vehicles when they really need them - rather than owning a car they seldom use. \"Privately owned cars are a big problem,\" says Prof Kent Larson, head of the Future Cities programme at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. \"Most cars in cities aren't being used 90% of the time,\" he says. \"The rest of the time, they're parked up and wasting valuable space. But if we can move to a shared model, we can increase the use of a single vehicle by at least five times.\" That's where driverless cars come in. What if we could stay young forever? What if everyone had a car? What If? is a season across BBC News looking at visions of the future. What If (special report) \"The Holy Grail is a vehicle that can drive itself and park itself and charge itself autonomously,\" says Prof Larson. \"At that point, wherever you are in the city, you can call for a vehicle. It can come to where you are and you drive off. \"When you reach your destination, you get out of the car, put it into autonomy mode and the car goes back to wherever it needs to be, ready for the next trip.\" The idea is that such a system would make borrowing a car as convenient as owning one, but without any of the drawbacks, such as needing to find somewhere to park it. But the existence of driverless cars creates new problems. Who would be legally responsible in the event of an accident, for example? Even if the evidence suggests computers drive better, would people actually accept being at the mercy of a box of electronics? And if cars are designed to communicate with one another, what is there to stop the system being targeted by cybercriminals? Some answers are already being found. In the Media Lab at MIT sits a model car known as Aevita. She has striking blue eyes - or rather, her headlights are surrounded by flashing blue optical fibres and they follow you as you move around the room. She can also speak to you in a rather pleasant English accent. The idea is simple. If future cars do not have drivers they are likely to make pedestrians nervous. After all, how will you know whether it's safe to cross the road, if you can't look the driver in the eye? Well, with Aevita, you can.

{"article": "France is worried by the prime minister's push to protect non-euro countries from eurozone regulations. Now, you could say that sounds entirely reasonable. Most EU countries use the euro. Why should they be allowed to gang up to the disadvantage of non-euro countries like Britain? But France thinks David Cameron and George Osborne, the UK Chancellor, are being sneaky. It suspects they are using the argument to win an unfair advantage for the City of London and a backdoor veto on eurozone and wider EU financial legislation. The French economy is sluggish, to put it politely, and the French president is about to enter the political race for re-election. He cannot be seen to open the door for Britain to do even better financially while his eurozone hands are tied. Two weeks ago on the eve of the publication in Brussels of David Cameron's draft reform plans, we were told by a high-level source close to the negotiations that the French delayed them for hours, worrying about the wording referring to safeguards for non-eurozone countries. All leaders have to sign up to the reforms this Thursday for them to be passed at the EU summit. The French could again quibble, clash over and even dash the prime minister's hopes of a deal.  If they so choose. A real possibility, however, is that after hours of closed-door negotiations, the summit will end in the kind of EU-fudge so derided by the bloc's critics. Yet in true EU style, all sides want to be able to walk away saying they have won something. The French will likely crow that the British failed to get a veto over eurozone legislation (even though David Cameron never asked for one). The countries of central and eastern Europe got Britain's promise to help bolster Nato in eastern Europe as a pre-summit sweetener. They also hope to restrict reductions in EU migrant in-work and child benefits to the UK only. The European Commission and council played key roles as facilitator and mediator respectively and, as such, got some respectful press coverage in Europe - something which, in these days of eurozone and migration crisis, they are little used to. And David Cameron should get his deal in time for him to call the referendum as soon as possible - which is thought to be 23 June. He knows full well that, whatever the content of a deal, his critics will decry it. So he seems to prefer to tick just enough boxes, particularly the one that appears to address migration - the key concern of many of his voters. He knows that persuading the British people to support any deal ahead of the referendum is a far tougher challenge than getting 27 fractious and distracted EU leaders onside. The prime minister wants to leave his EU colleagues to return to arguably the toughest issue on their plates: refugees, boats and migrant quotas. On Monday, European Council President Donald Tusk appealed to EU leaders to help David Cameron get his reforms. \"It is high time we started listening to each other's arguments, the risk of break-up is real. What is broken cannot be mended,\" he said. If those are Mr Tusk's words on Brexit (the idea of Britain leaving the EU), what might he say about the refugee and migration crisis, combined with the steady crumbling of European unity?

{"article": "Type-2 diabetes is closely linked to diet and obesity and affects about 3.2 million people across the UK. The NHS says diabetes causes 22,000 early deaths and costs the health service more than Â£8bn each year. But health experts believe more than a quarter of people can reduce the risk of developing the condition. Diabetes arises when the body loses the ability to use or make insulin, a hormone that helps regulate the amount of sugar in blood. Public Health England (PHE) says its latest analysis shows about five million adults in England are now pre-diabetic, also known as non-diabetic hyperglycaemia. That means they are at risk of developing type-2 diabetes. Public Health England says its calculations have produced the most accurate and robust estimate so far. Last year, research published in the British Medical Journal suggested a much higher figure - one third of all adults in England - and the charity Diabetes UK quotes a UK-wide figure of about 18 million people at risk of developing diabetes. But these calculations used a broader definition of pre-diabetes than that used in this latest analysis. Some doctors have questioned the value of the pre-diabetic diagnosis, arguing that only a small number - perhaps one in 10 - will go on to develop diabetes. But the NHS is preparing to roll out a diet, weight loss and exercise programme that has been shown to reduce the diabetes risk for a quarter of those who take it up. PHE chief executive Duncan Selbie said people needed support if they were to combat the risk posed by type-2 diabetes. \"We know how to lower the risk of developing type-2 diabetes: lose weight, exercise and eat healthily, but it's hard to do it alone,\" he said. \"PHE's evidence review shows that supporting people along the way will help them protect their health, and that's what our prevention programme will do.\" Diabetes UK chief executive  Barbara Young said it was important to warn people about a condition that could have devastating complications such as blindness, amputations and early death. \"As well as helping to reduce the human cost of type-2 diabetes, this would also go a long way to helping to reduce costs to the NHS,\" she said. \"The NHS spends 10% of its entire budget managing diabetes And unless we get better at preventing type-2 diabetes, this figure will rise to unsustainable levels.\"", "question": "Up to five million people in England are at risk of developing type - 2 diabetes , according to new @placeholder from Public Health England .", "option_0": "pictures", "option_1": "data", "option_2": "released", "option_3": "gleaned", "option_4": "analysis", "label": 1}

Up to 80 schools regularly enter teams of players aged 13 and under. \"We've had very few problems at all this year,\" added Robinson. \"The parents and children seem to have embraced the new rules and it pretty much polices itself, which is great news for the referees and for the vast majority of people who come to watch rugby in the right spirit. \"We hope that this could be a template that could be rolled out to other children's rugby tournaments.

{"article": "This year, Daniel Dawson is spending more than Â£3,000 and travelling more than 4,000 miles to see approximately 35 pantomimes all over Britain. For two months a year, the 42-year-old business account manager from Sheffield immerses himself in a flamboyant world of festive fairytale and farce - because, he says, pantos are a great form of escapism and the pantomime circuit is highly sociable. Mr Dawson writes about his travels on his Panto Insider website and ends the season by picking his best and worst shows and stars of the year. I've collected autographs for a long time and panto is usually a good place to see famous names you perhaps wouldn't get to see for the rest of the year. It became a very easy place to meet famous people and get autographs. Then I realised I enjoyed the fact that this was a break from the realities of normal life for a couple of hours. You can just forget about what's going on in your life or the world or any problems or difficulties and have a damn good laugh for two-and-a-half hours. People like Henry Winkler, Priscilla Presley and Linda Gray - they're the big American superstars. And this year I'm hoping I'll get to meet Verne Troyer, who's in Wimbledon. Around the last six or seven years. A lot of people who are in panto are interested in what's happening in different cities and who's good and who's not so good, but they're working for most of the season. Anyone who's in panto will struggle to see more than three or four shows themselves. As the blog took off, people said: 'Who's the best baddie, who was the best fairy this year, who was the best Buttons?' So I thought I'd do an award. It's only a bit of fun - there are no prizes or credibility! I went to Newcastle Theatre Royal for the first time five years ago. I didn't really know any of the cast and had very low expectations. The first show I saw there is still today the best panto I've ever seen. It was sensational. Spectacular, funny, amazing scenes, really good planned mayhem. And they always put on a good show. This is Clive Webb and Danny Adams's 11th year. They're father and son and their brother Mick's also in the show. It's a fantastic show because they work so well together. And Newcastle try to do things that are completely different to what's been done before and take things one step further. Stoke is always excellent as well. They've got a fantastic pairing of Johnny Wilkes and Christian Patterson, who are really good friends outside panto season, and it comes across on stage. When people are good friends there's a much better chemistry. From a traditional point of view, the top three would be, in no particular order, Nigel Ellacott, Andrew Ryan and Chris Hayward. They're very glamorous dames with beautiful, exquisite costumes and look phenomenal. For the 'fat bloke in a dress' type of dame, you've got Damian Williams, who does Sheffield, and Christian Patterson. Those two are so funny it's ridiculous. And it would be unfair not to mention Eric Potts as well, who writes most of the scripts for First Family Entertainment but is also one of their dames. They can help and they can backfire. I've seen some spectacular fails. A number of years ago Steve Guttenberg was in the UK to do a panto. I love Police Academy but I created the 'fish out of water' award based on his performance. He's an absolutely brilliant comic actor, but he didn't get panto. But other celebrities are fantastic. Stephen Mulhern last year in Crawley was sensational. Bradley Walsh is another one who is always fantastic in panto. He just knows how to work an audience. There was a massive one in Birmingham a few years ago. They had the late Keith Harris and Orville, Julian Clary, Nigel Havers, Joan Collins and Jeffrey Holland who was in Hi-De-Hi. It was a massive show. With great difficulty. It takes an awful lot of planning. I try to get to as many shows over weekends as I can. I've also got a season ticket for Sheffield Wednesday and I don't want to miss any home matches either. When Wednesday are away I can go anywhere in the country to watch a show. When they're at home it has to be within an hour of Hillsborough at full-time. I try to take some time off between Christmas and New Year, and go on an actual tour from Boxing Day through to New Year's Eve. There I'll normally do two shows a day, so that does help me get through quite a lot. Absolutely - it is expensive. It depends.

{"article": "On the civil side, aircraft manufacturers are buoyant, with new products to display and a record backlog of orders. In contrast, the military sector is less confident. Defence budget cuts, particularly in Washington, have meant arms programmes being scaled back or abandoned. Optimism among commercial aircraft makers was underlined last week when Boeing published its closely-watched annual forecast for aircraft demand over the next 20 years. The US planemaker estimates that airlines, leasing companies and freight firms will need 35,280 new planes, a rise of 3.8% on the US manufacturer's previous forecast. The bulk of the demand will come from the Asia-Pacific region as it becomes the biggest travel and tourism market, said Randy Tinseth, vice-president for marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \"There is no doubt the industry's centre of gravity is moving from the US to Asia. Right now, 37% of all traffic touches Asia,\" he said. In 20 years, he estimates, that number will be 50%. The Paris Air Show headlines will be dominated by Boeing, and that other big beast of the industry, Airbus, shouting about how many orders they have won. It's a fair bet that most of those orders will be placed by Asian and Middle East airlines, with many buying aircraft in the key medium range segment dominated by Boeing's 737 and the Airbus A320. But what could be fascinating about the Paris trade fair is that this market segment is the one where the two manufacturers face the biggest challenge to their duopoly. China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation, Irkut from Russia, and Canada's Bombardier - with its C-Series close to making its first test flight - are developing aircraft that they hope will take market share. And all three have a big presence at the show. Given the ambitions of these companies, and the demand for new aircraft over the next two decades, analysts believe there is space for new entrants. Says aviation consultant Howard Wheeldon: \"The expansion of China, Russia and Japan, along with existing players who may yet have other long-term intentions such as Embraer and Bombardier, may bring closer the day when the current duopoly between Boeing and Airbus is brought into question.\" The order books at Boeing and Airbus are bulging with a backlog of some 6,000 aircraft. High fuel costs, requirements for reduced noise, and the need to replace ageing aircraft means there is certainly a market for these challenger planemakers to aim at. But Wheeldon wonders if this could be as good as it gets. \"With analysts now suggesting that the price of oil may have peaked, particularly given the increase in US shale gas production, will some of the urgency to replace older aircraft now disappear?\" This is the 50th aerospace trade fair in Paris since the city hosted its first in 1909. As it is on Airbus's home turf, the company will want to make a big splash. Boeing, therefore, will not want to be upstaged. One, possibly two, Boeing Dreamliners, will be on display - one making aerial displays and the other on the ground. Boeing wants to ram home the message that the aircraft's troubles of earlier this year are well behind it. Meanwhile, Airbus, which on Friday made a much-anticipated maiden flight of its A350, may yet get clearance for the new-generation aircraft to make a flypast. In the battle for the hearts and minds of the world's aviation money-men, such symbolism matters. New aircraft are prone to delays and technical problems. So proving that your latest product can actually fly is a major milestone, says Nick Cunningham, aviation analyst at Agency Partners. \"It's good news because it means that you've missed an opportunity to have another big delay,\" he says. But the pace of growth worries some experts. Problems with large industrial projects like building aircraft are not new. BBC News will be reporting from the Paris Air Show from 17-23 June You will be able to find out the latest on BBC World News TV, on BBC World Service radio and on the BBC News website Full coverage: Aerospace industry But analysts such as Wheeldon wonder if last year's Airbus A380 wing problems, followed by this year's temporary grounding of the Dreamliner are indicative of pressures to use new technologies to reduce weight and improve efficiency. He says: \"Are the technological boundaries that we understand being pushed too far too fast? Indeed, how much room is really left for airline operators to make even more all-important performance gains?\" They are questions that need more discussion, he says. The bragging rights at air shows go to the company that announces the most orders. At a media briefing on Thursday, EADS chief executive Tom Enders said he hoped the airlines would sign contracts for firm orders and options for \"hundreds\" of aircraft. At the Paris show two years ago, Airbus notched up more than 700 orders. Analysts do not expect a repeat of that number. Boeing, meanwhile, has actually played down expectations that it would notch up a large batch of orders, suggesting that, these days, trade shows carry less importance as occasions to negotiate and network with potential buyers. A deliberate lowering of expectations? Or part of the marketing psychology designed to outflank Airbus? We'll know by the end of the week. One product we may hear a lot about, however, is a \"stretched\" version of the Dreamliner, so that it can carry more passengers and compete more directly with Airbus's new A350. Boeing has yet to give the go-ahead for the project, but Singapore Airlines and United Airlines have said they might consider buying a larger Dreamliner. If Boeing can get a couple of launch customers to commit, Paris would be an ideal time to make the announcement. The company may also use Paris to officially push the button on a more modern version of its existing 777, using a greater amount of composite materials. However, Richard Aboulafia, analyst with the Teal Group, is not expecting too much from Boeing at the show. \"Boeing has the broader product line but they are still struggling under the shadows of the 787 (battery) nightmare and they seem unenthusiastic about launching new products.\" On the defence side, Paris may be a lot quieter than normal (except for the fighter jets that scream across the skies during the daily displays). Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defence company, has a much-reduced presence and will not fly its F-35, a jet regarded as a technological masterpiece. And Northrop Grumman - whose companies include the builder of the Spirit of St Louis, which made the first solo non-stop New York to Paris flight - is not attending. US government officials and military top brass will also be in short supply. Money is tight following deep budget cuts. But the lack of the usual strong US presence has surprised some experts, as its defence firms now need exports more than ever. This may open the door for other countries to better showcase their wares to the 50-plus official government and military delegations due to attend. Russia will be out in force, displaying attack helicopters and fighter jets, including the Sukhoi Su-35. Embraer will show its Super Tucano combat aircraft, and from Europe the Saab Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon, and Airbus A400M will make appearances. But Europe, too, has scaled down its turnout. \"Defence is in the doldrums and cuts to the budgets of all European nations will impact on what equipment is shown.\" By the end of the week, some lucky companies will have done deals and covered their costs of going to Paris a thousand-fold. Others will wonder why they bothered. But, says Wheeldon: \"For everyone who engages in the world of aviation and whose professional lives are bound up in various forms of aerospace technology, Paris can for one week be the greatest place in the world.\"", "question": "The biggest aerospace @placeholder of the year takes off in Paris this week with the two sectors that make up the industry in different moods .", "option_0": "event", "option_1": "version", "option_2": "chunks", "option_3": "picture", "option_4": "phase", "label": 0}

Others worry that he represents a return to the authoritarian security state that prevailed under Mr Mubarak. Egypt is a major regional media player. Its TV and film industries supply much of the Arab-speaking world with content and its press is influential. TV is the favourite medium and there are several big hitters in the sector, including the state broadcaster. Media freedom organisations say successive governments have been intent on controlling the media and have not hesitated to clamp down on journalists.

{"article": "Last month, the DUP negotiated an extra £1bn in spending in exchange for backing the Tories at Westminster. On Wednesday, Mr Brokenshire stopped short of ruling out that it could be dependent on restoring devolution. The DUP has always insisted the money is not subject to that condition. Mr Wilson accused the secretary of state of not being able to \"give a straight answer\", and said it had been made clear to his party that the money was available to Northern Ireland as long as the DUP support the government on certain measures at Westminster. Under the 'confidence and supply' arrangement the two parties reached last month, the DUP guarantees that its 10 MPs will vote with the government on the Queen's Speech, the Budget, and legislation relating to Brexit and national security. \"As long as we do that, the money is there,\" said the East Antrim MP, adding that Mr Brokenshire was \"pussyfooting around\" on the issue. \"If the assembly isn't up and running, then assembly members will not have a decision on how it is spent, it will be direct rule ministers,\" he added. \"I'd prefer the assembly would have input but if that's not going to happen then why can't he just say it rather than trying to speak on both sides of his mouth?\" The East Antrim MP said the secretary of state needed to make his position clear and said if direct rule is implemented, the DUP will be in a \"major position for consultation then\" about how the extra funding is spent. On Wednesday, the secretary of state allocated an extra £131m to health and education in Northern Ireland, as part of a reallocation of funds known as a monitoring round. It was his second intervention in Stormont's finances in the absence of a functioning executive. Speaking to BBC Newsline, Mr Brokenshire said the latest funding allocation was not a long-term solution. \"What we're saying is that this money is for a new executive to see that we get local politicians making decisions, there will be a whole host of decisions to take should that not happen,\" he said. \"I recognise the specific financial needs Northern Ireland has, but the point is that things like infrastructure, roads, investment in hospitals - that requires political decision-making and that why we need to see the parties coming back together again and getting an executive in place.\" Asked if the money would be available if there is no restoration of power-sharing at Stormont by 2018, Mr Brokenshire said he would not \"hypothesise or speculate\" as to what would happen.

UK teenagers had a below average satisfaction score of seven. But anxiety about exams and bullying remains a problem for many young people. And heavy internet use leaves many feeling lonely and less satisfied. The findings are based on a survey of 540,000 students internationally who also completed the OECD Pisa tests in science, mathematics and reading in 2015. The study reveals large variations in life satisfaction out of 48 OECD countries and partner nations. The highest levels of satisfaction were found in the Dominican Republic (8.5), Mexico (8.3) and Costa Rica (8.2), while the Asian countries or economies of Korea (6.4), Hong Kong (6.5), Macau (6.6) and Taiwan (6.6) recorded low levels of satisfaction. The UK took 38th place for life satisfaction, behind countries such as Russia (7.8), Bulgaria (7.4) and Estonia (7.5). The study found girls and disadvantaged students were less likely than boys and advantaged students to report high levels of life satisfaction. Despite reasonably high average levels of satisfaction, bullying was a significant problem for many youngsters, with a large proportion saying they had been victims. On average across OECD countries, about 11% of teenagers said they were frequently mocked, 7% were \"left out of things\" and 8% were the subject of hurtful rumours. Around 4% of students - approximately one child per class - reported that they were hit or pushed at least a few times per month. But the OECD research found less bullying in schools where students had positive relationships with their teachers. Exam stress was also a problem, with 59% of students saying they often worried that taking a test would be difficult and 66% saying they worried about getting poor grades. Across OECD countries, about 55% of students said they were very anxious before a test, even if they were well prepared for it. Girls had a tendency to worry more than boys, with girls in all 72 countries reporting greater levels of schoolwork-related anxiety than boys. The report found students spent more than two hours online during a typical weekday after school and more than three hours online during a typical weekend day. The majority said the internet was a great resource for obtaining information and more than half said they felt bad if no internet connection was available. Students who spent more than six hours online on weekdays outside of school hours were more likely to report that they were not satisfied with their life or that they felt lonely at school. They were also less proficient in science than students who spent fewer hours online. The OECD research found that between 2012 and 2015, the time teenagers spent online outside of school hours increased by at least 40 minutes a day on both weekdays and weekends. The study concluded that teenagers who felt part of a school community and had good relationships with their parents and teachers were more likely to perform better academically and be happier with their lives. Students who felt their teacher was willing to provide help and was interested in their learning were about 1.3 times more likely to feel that they belonged at school, researchers found.

To mark the BBC's Tech Talent week, we've revisited the study and focused on the areas where there are at least 7,000 digital tech jobs. What's striking is that at first glance, the numbers seem to confirm that London's cluster is well ahead of any other - and indeed the capital hosts several of tech's better-known names. But once you combine the data with official population statistics, another picture emerges. Based on a calculation of how many tech jobs there are per head of the local population, Cambridge, Reading and Bracknell, and Oxford and Abingdon take the lead. It's no coincidence that all three have universities with strong reputations for science, engineering and computing. Southampton and Manchester also do well. And Ipswich is another standout, thanks to the fact that many firms there have congregated around the headquarters of BT Research - the telecoms firm's R&D division.

{"article": "The scientists claim that a thigh bone found in August contains remarkably well-preserved marrow cells, which could form the starting point of the experiment. The team claim that the cloning could be complete within the next five years. But others have cast doubt on whether such a thing is possible. The team, from the Siberian mammoth museum and Japan's Kinki University, said that they planned to extract a nucleus from the animal's bone marrow and insert it into the egg of an African elephant. Similar procedures have been done before with mixed results. In 2009it was reportedthat the recently extinct Pyrenean ibex was brought back to life briefly using 10-year-old DNA from the animal's skin. The cloned ibex died within minutes of being born, due to breathing difficulties. The Roslin Institute, famous for cloning Dolly the sheep, no longer conducts cloning work but haspublished some thoughtson the possibilities of bringing extinct species back to life. It said it was extremely unlikely such an experiment would be successful, especially using an elephant surrogate. \"First, a suitable surrogate mother animal is required. For the mammoth this would need to be a cow (as best biological fit) but even here the size difference may preclude gestation to term,\" it said. The success rate for such an experiment would be in the range of 1-5%, it said. The second issue would be the need for viable whole cells. \"If there are intact cells in this tissue they have been 'stored' frozen. However, if we think back to what actually happened to the animal - it died, even if from the cold, the cells in the body would have taken some time to freeze. This time lag would allow for breakdown of the cells, which normally happens when any animal dies. Then the carcass would freeze. So it is unlikely that the cells would be viable,\" it said. Assuming that viable cells are found it becomes a numbers game, it went on. \"Let's say that one in a thousand cells were nevertheless viable, practical issues come into play. Given that we have an efficiency of 1% cloning for livestock species and if only one in a thousand cells are viable then around 100,000 cells would need to be transferred,\" it said. Charles Foster, a fellow at Green Templeton College, Oxford, seemed more optimistic. \"The idea of mammoth cloning isn't completely ridiculous. \"How the resultant embryos would fare beyond the stage of a few cells is more or less unknown,\" he said. While most of the genetic coding of the embryo would come from the mammoth, some would come from the elephant ovum. \"We really don't know what the contribution of that cytoplasmic material is, or how it would interact with 'alien' DNA,\" he said. It would however mean that, even if successful, the clone would be a hybrid rather than a pure mammoth.", "question": "Scientists from Russia and Japan are undertaking a Jurassic Park - @placeholder experiment in an effort to bring the woolly mammoth out of extinction .", "option_0": "style", "option_1": "controlled", "option_2": "ditch", "option_3": "designed", "option_4": "sized", "label": 0}

{"article": "The Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverley Hills has seen a few popes come and go. This pretty Spanish mission-style church has been here since 1923. Hollywood stars have been married in front of its altar. The funerals of Rudolph Valentino, Frank Sinatra and Alfred Hitchcock were held here. Today its congregation is diverse: no famous faces in sight, but a mix of old and young, rich and poor, white and Hispanic - a mirror of the wider Catholic population. Here in the City of Angels, 40% of the population is Catholic. The Los Angeles Archdiocese is the largest in the US, representing five million souls. It is also one of the most shaken by the crisis of clergy sexual abuse. As the church leadership calls for prayers for the cardinal-electors in Rome, the congregants share a widespread concern among American Catholics that the leadership needs first to reform itself. \"Growing up in the Church, they said ''fess up to your sins and then move on',\" says Francisco, a film producer. \"That's what the Church needs to do.\" If the focus of the attention was at first on the priests accused of sexual abuse, it has now shifted to the hierarchy - and to its flawed handling of those priests. Only this year has the extent of the cover-up in this archdiocese - and the local archbishop's role in it - come to light. Before his retirement in 2011, Cardinal Roger Mahony was the popular archbishop here. For much of his 26 years in that role, he was seen as a champion of immigrant rights and social justice. He also did a great deal to protect accused clergy from the law. In January, a court forced the release of thousands of Church files. They revealed extensive efforts by Cardinal Mahony and other Church officials to shield priests suspected of sexual abuse. In some cases they sent clerics out of state or even out of country to avoid criminal investigations. In one 1988 memo, the Reverend Thomas Curry, a former top aide to then-Archbishop Mahony, wrote about a priest accused of molesting 20 altar boys in nine months. \"The whole issue of our records is a very sensitive one, and I am reluctant to give any list to the police,\" wrote Father Curry. \"We cannot give such a list for no cause whatsoever,\" Archbishop Mahony responded. After the files were made public, Thomas Curry resigned from his post as auxiliary bishop of Santa Barbara. Cardinal Mahony was promptly stripped by his successor of all public and administrative duties. He responded to the public rebuke by defending his record. In an open letter to Archbishop Jose Gomez, who took over the archdiocese in 2011, he wrote: \"Unfortunately, I cannot return now to the 1980s and reverse actions and decisions made then. But when I retired as an active archbishop, I handed over to you an archdiocese that was second to none in protecting children and youth.\" The rebuke was, however, largely symbolic. Cardinal Mahony remains a \"priest in good standing\", according to the church. At 76, he is still eligible to vote in the conclave. He went to Rome, sparking protests at home. \"It's a slap in the face to us victims,\" says Esther Miller. She is one of 508 victims of alleged abuse, to whom the Los Angeles Archdiocese collectively paid a record-breaking $660m (Â£438m) in 2007. \"I don't believe Mahony has the moral authority to sit there and vote for the next pope,\" she says. \"The people in the pews are owed transparency.\" Since the worldwide crisis erupted in Boston in 2002, the US Conference of Catholic Bishops has led the way in creating new guidelines for child protection and for dealing with accused priests. And last year, Philadelphia's Monsignor William Lynn became the first church official jailed for his part in a cover-up. But the scandal has cost the Church dearly - in dollars and in reputation. For some Catholics, the hierarchy's response of reflects a broader crisis in its leadership. Sister Judy Vaughan is helping volunteers serve spaghetti bolognese to children and their mothers gathered in the kitchen of Alexandria House. She founded this homeless shelter in Los Angeles in 1996, and most of those who live here are survivors of domestic abuse. Sister Judy, 67, belongs to the Sisters of St Joseph of Carondelet. She does not wear a habit and lives in the shelter. She says the all-male hierarchy is preoccupied with its own power and has lost the mission of the faith - to serve the poor. \"Even in their numbers they are not reflective of the Church,\" she says of the 115 cardinals gathered in Rome. \"I'm Catholic to the core but the institutional Church has proven to be to so many of us irrelevant because of their practice and their teachings.\" Most Catholics in America favour some reforms in the Church. A majority support married priests. Many want a change in positions on contraception. But according to a new survey by the Pew Forum, Catholics in the US view the crisis of clerical sexual abuse as the most important challenge facing the Church. A third of respondents identified that scandal as the key priority. Second on the list, 9%, selected \"dishonesty/low credibility/low trust\" as the main problem. Yet in spite of the revelations, the resignations, and the multi-million dollar civil settlements that have forced the sale of Church assets across the country, no strong evidence has emerged that the abuse crisis has driven many from the faith. Monsignor Thomas Wilbers, who leads the congregation at the Church of the Good Shepherd, takes the long view. \"It certainly is a major crisis for the Church. But the Church has weathered crises perhaps even stronger than this one throughout its history,\" he says. \"After all, Roman emperors said the Church was finished. It wasn't, and I don't think it is now.\" For now, America's Catholics can only watch and wait to see in which direction the Church is heading.", "question": "While their former archbishop takes part in the conclave to choose the next pope , Catholics in Los Angeles deal with his complicated legacy .

{"article": "The measure guarantees a majority of seats to the party that wins the most votes in an election. It is a key element of a package of reforms promised by Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. The law seeks to end Italy's post-war era of revolving governments, political horse-trading and unstable coalitions. The lower house of parliament gave final approval to the bill by 334 votes to 61. The proportional election system awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40% of the national vote. If no party reaches that threshold, there is a second-round run-off between the two parties with the most votes. The electoral reform is expected to come into force next year. After the vote, Mr Renzi said: \"Commitment achieved, promise respected. Italy needs people who don't always say no.\" Critics have accused the 40-year-old former mayor of Florence who became prime minster last year of trying to consolidate his grip on power. They complain that the law awards too much power to single parties, gives party bosses too much scope to select candidates, and denies voters the chance to directly choose representatives. Opposition parties boycotted Monday's vote. Renato Brunetta, parliamentary head of centre-right opposition party Forza Italia, said afterwards that it was \"a very ugly day for our country's democracy\".

{"article": "Chasing Sri Lanka's 169-6, Samit Patel scored a classy 67 but England finished on 150-9 to lose by 19 runs. Stuart Broad's side slumped to 18-3 after fast bowler Lasith Malinga took three wickets in an over on his way to figures of 5-31 in Pallekele. Sri Lanka join West Indies, who ended New Zealand's hopes, in the last four. Lasith Malinga becomes the fourth bowler in history to take a five-wicket haul in Test, one-day and T20 cricket - emulating Pakistan's Umar Gul, New Zealander Tim Southee and his compatriot Ajantha Mendis. His haul puts him second in the list of leading wicket-takers for the tournament. As in previous games in the tournament, notably against India and West Indies, England were let down by their top order batsmen. India's slow bowlers skittled England for 80 in the group stages and, with so-called mystery spinners Ajantha Mendis and Akila Dananjaya in the Sri Lankan line-up, it was expected to be another trial by spin. However, it was fiery fast bowler Malinga who blew England's top order away with a devastating burst in the third over of their reply. Luke Wright, promoted to opener in place of the dropped Craig Kieswetter, was first to go when he cut straight to Tillakaratne Dilshan at point. Jonny Bairstow, who also kept wicket, followed two balls later when he skied a slower ball to Nuwan Kulasekara at mid off before Alex Hales was out lbw, pinned in front by a yorker. That third wicket was unfortunate for England, with replays suggesting the ball was going to miss leg stump, and it was left to Samit Patel and Eoin Morgan to repair the damage. Patel, enjoying the responsibility of batting at number four, looked England's most comfortable batsman as he flayed Angelo Mathews for a massive six, got stuck into Kulasekera, and then plundered 14 runs from Ajantha Mendis's first over. \"Patel played the spinners so well he's got to be earmarked for a high batting position in the one-dayers in India. It was a brave effort considering he's had so little batting on this tour. Malinga conceded a few runs but he got five wickets.\" Indeed, if England can take any consolation from this defeat it was the performance of Patel ahead of this winter's Test tour to India. The Notts all-rounder dominated Mendis, who had recorded figures of 6-8 against Zimbabwe in the group stages, and cruised to 67 by mixing class with controlled aggression. He remained unperturbed by wickets falling at the other end, with Morgan missing a reverse sweep to Dananjaya and being given out leg before, and a woefully out of form Ravi Bopara scratching around for six balls before being bowled by Jeevan Mendis. When Swann added some late impetus with a counter-attacking 34 from 22 balls, England sensed the improbable was possible but Malinga ended those hopes when he came back to bowl Patel in the penultimate over before Kulasekera took care of Swann. Malinga was brutally effective with the ball, but it was the elegance of Mahela Jayawardene that got Sri Lanka off to a good start with the bat. The opener defied the early loss of Dilshan to stroke 42 before becoming the first of two wickets in as many balls for Swann. Jayawardene holed out to Morgan at midwicket before Sangakkara was given out caught behind, despite replays suggesting he had not touched the ball. Angelo Mathews went on the counter with a quickfire 28, but Broad stalled any momentum by dismissing him and Jeevan Mendis in consecutive deliveries. Thisara Perera powered 26 crucial runs, including two sixes, in the closing overs before Malinga took over with the ball.", "question": "Defending champions England have been knocked out of the World Twenty20 after being overpowered by @placeholder Sri Lanka in their final Super Eights match .", "option_0": "inflicting", "option_1": "relegated", "option_2": "battling", "option_3": "outclassing", "option_4": "hosts", "label": 4}

{"article": "Many clubs are facing a major financial crisis and have not paid salaries for several months. The footballers' union says the strike will go on until the players received what they are owed. The strike involves players of more than 200 Argentine clubs. The two matches postponed were Rosario Central v Godoy Cruz, in the city of Rosario, and San Lorenzo v Belgrano, in Buenos Aires. The crisis began after senior officials at the Football Association (AFA) were implicated in a corruption scandal involving television broadcasting rights. The season should have resumed a month ago after the summer recess. But the crisis led the AFA to delay the start until this Friday. To try to avoid the strike, the government of Mauricio Macri made a $22m (Â£18m) payment on Thursday to the Argentine Football Association. The money was owed as compensation for the cancellation of a contract with the government, which held the broadcasting rights until this year. But the players' union says the money is not enough. They said most club presidents had spent and borrowed more money than they should have. The death in 2014 of Julio Grondona, who was president of the Argentine Football Association for 35 years, triggered the crisis. He was also vice-president of Fifa, the world football's governing body. The United States authorities who investigated corruption at Fifa labelled Mr Grondona \"the number one conspirator\".

{"article": "If a picture is worth a thousand words, what does this one tell us? Keeping in mind that the image presented is the one the White House wants to convey, the photograph still invites a number of observations and, perhaps, conclusions. Here are five of them. Let's get to the most obvious question first. What is the president watching so intently? According to Spicer's tweet, the people present are looking at a screen showing Vice-President Mike Pence, Defence Secretary James Mattis and Joseph Dunford, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The trio are part of the national security team at the White House tasked with explaining the results of the strike devised to punish the Syrian government for using chemical weapons on its own population. That's Spicer, by the way, tucked into the back left corner of the room. A quick glance at the Trump team photo instantly recalls what was perhaps the most memorable modern \"war room\" image, from 2011, when President Barack Obama and his national security team clustered around a monitor to watch the raid to kill Osama Bin Laden unfold. A key difference, of course, is that the Obama photo was taken in the White House Situation Room. Trump and his team gathered in a nondescript location at his Mar-a-Lago private club that has been converted into a Scif - a \"sensitive compartmented information facility\" - where the president and his aides can conduct secure communications. Trump and his team are seated in gold-painted chairs and the hint of an ornamental rug can be seen beneath their feet. Given that Mr Trump has spent most of his weekends at his Mar-a-Lago estate, this room - or one like it - will likely be the scene of more than a few dramatic events during his presidency. One of the more noteworthy stories earlier in the week, before the Syrian strike blew the news cycle out of the water, was the ongoing feud between presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump nationalist consigliere Steve Bannon. It seemed Kushner was gaining the upper hand, rapidly expanding his policy portfolio, while Bannon was on the outs - booted from his permanent seat on the National Security Council. Both men were in the room Thursday night, although the seating arrangement was telling. Kushner was front and centre at the table, casting what seems to be a cold gaze in the general direction of Bannon, who was a lamp away from being pushed up against a wall. (Stephen Miller, one of Bannon's closest White House allies, is also barely visible, seated to Bannon's left.) There's something else interesting about the seating arrangement in this photograph. On the president's left is his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson. On his right? Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin - not the kind of Cabinet officials one would expect to see prominently featured in a national security briefing. Part of the explanation could be that Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago travel team was heavily stacked with economic advisers for his meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, is seated along the wall on the right. Perhaps they felt comfortable tagging along with the president to learn the results of the missile strike. It's probably safe to say, however, that a commerce secretary, usually a low man on the cabinet totem pole, has never before had such prominent real estate during a key national security meeting. During that fateful 2011 raid on Bin Laden's compound, one woman - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - was prominently featured, her hand to her mouth in apparent concern (or, she has since said, a result of seasonal allergies). Another woman, director of counterterrorism Audrey Tomason, is also visible. There's only one woman among the 15 in the Trump photograph, US Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategy Dina Powell. Ms Powell was an adviser to Ivanka Trump during the presidential transition and originally served as the president's senior adviser for entrepreneurship, economic growth and the empowerment of women. Like Gary Cohn, she also is a former high-ranking officer in the investment bank Goldman Sachs. All told, the photograph contains six men who can best be described as White House political/staff advisers, four national security or foreign affairs officials, three members of the president's economics team and a military attache.

{"article": "After decades of division in Cyprus, there is genuine belief a political solution will bring together Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south. Since 1974, when a brief Athens-inspired coup was followed by a Turkish military invasion, the island has been cut in two, with the northern third controlled by Turkish Cypriots and the southern two-thirds by Greek Cypriots. So, why now? The catalyst for the negotiations was the election last April of the Turkish Cypriot President, Mustafa Akinci, who campaigned on a promise to broker a peace deal with the south. Negotiations between Mr Akinci and Nicos Anastasiades, the Greek Cypriot President of the island, began last May. It is fitting that the bulk of their talks are being held at Nicosia airport, a site that symbolises the stalemate in Cyprus. Abandoned during the conflict of 1974, it is now sandwiched in the UN buffer zone, frozen in time. The lonely shell of a Cyprus Airways passenger jet lies on the tarmac. The terminal, which opened in 1968, is now home only to nesting pigeons and the smell of damp. Advertising posters from 1974 remain fixed to walls. You could forgive the pessimism of Cypriots who shrug their shoulders when the prospect of a peace deal is raised. They have seen this before. In 2004, the UN's plan to make Cyprus a federation of two states was emphatically rejected by the public in a referendum. Twelve years later, there is a sense the political atmosphere has changed. A short stroll from the airport is the office of Aleem Siddique, the spokesman for the UN on the island. \"One of the key reasons why people are a lot more optimistic this time around is the trust between the two leaders,\" he tells me. The two presidents share much in common.  They are a similar age, and both were born in the southern city of Limassol. In December, they delivered a joint TV address to wish residents a happy holiday and spoke of their hopes for a deal in 2016. In the centre of Nicosia, it's impossible to escape the reminders of the conflict. The UN buffer zone snakes through Europe's last divided capital. It is lined with derelict, crumbling buildings and endless spirals of barbed wire resting on oil drums. There is one place in the buffer zone where the atmosphere is much more welcoming. The Home for Cooperation, a community centre open to everybody on the island, hosts classes where people can learn Greek, Turkish and English. Language remains a big obstacle to integration in Cyprus. Yaprak Aydin, who lives in the Turkish-controlled north, says the centre is also about people coming together and developing empathy for those not from their own community. She smiles as she recalls a story of a Greek Cypriot lady who got in touch with the centre to tell them she had met her best friend in their cafe. The friend was Turkish Cypriot. \"Never underestimate the power of a cup of coffee, especially in Cyprus,\" Ms Aydin tells me. Despite the sense of hope, there remain big obstacles to overcome. During the conflict, tens of thousands of people were displaced from their homes. The delicate question remains what happens if the island unites. Is the property returned or will the owners compensated? And from where would the money come? Security is a further complication. For many Greek Cypriots, the departure of Turkish troops from the island is non-negotiable. For some Turkish Cypriots though, the Turkish military presence provides reassurance. However, following the financial crisis on the island in 2013, there was recognition a solution could reap economic dividends, with trade routes opened up to Turkey. For Mr Siddique, though, Cypriots should consider not only the economic benefits, but the international example that would be set in the region. \"The symbolism of a largely Muslim Turkish Cypriot community and a largely Christian Greek Cypriot community coming together would send such a strong signal across the world,\" he says.", "question": "At a time when walls and fences are going up across Europe in response to the migrant crisis , there is hope a long - @placeholder barrier in one part of the continent could finally come down in 2016 .", "option_0": "gathering", "option_1": "term", "option_2": "phenomenon", "option_3": "standing", "option_4": "serving", "label": 3}
{"article": "The waves first washed over his glass bubble, then swallowed it, with underwater cameras capturing the slow slide down. Officially, the dive was designed to view an ancient shipwreck on the seabed. But it was also about demonstrating who is boss here now. Vladimir Putin is spending three days in Crimea with a whole delegation of senior Russian politicians and business figures in tow. Kiev has condemned the visit as an attempt to whip up tensions, and underlined that Crimea's only possible future was back with Ukraine. So when Vladimir Putin docked for a moment in Sevastopol, I put that point to him. \"The future of Crimea was determined by the people who live on this land,\" the president replied on the quayside, stony-faced and unequivocal. \"They voted to be united with Russia. That's it. Full stop.\" The results of a hastily-called vote on joining Russia did show overwhelming support in Crimea for annexation. But the March 2014 referendum that Moscow hailed as the people's choice, was held with armed men on the streets and in clear violation of Ukraine's constitution. As a result, the US and Europe imposed economic sanctions on Russia, and Crimea's annexation is formally recognised by next to no-one. Still, there is no doubt that the majority here are strongly sympathetic to Moscow. And, for Russians, \"returning\" the region from Ukraine, after its \"loss\" in Soviet times, was a very popular cause. So Moscow has begun pouring in funds to back up its political claim on the peninsula, and to show it cares. The children splashing in the sea and doing press-up contests at the Artek children's camp are already benefiting from that. The sprawling complex cut into the hills was the biggest and most prestigious pioneer camp in Soviet times: a dream destination for the young. Many Russian ex-Artekovites welcomed its \"homecoming\" with nostalgia. The main canteen, sports halls and swimming pool have already been renovated and millions more roubles have been allocated. But Russia is confident its money will not be lost. \"For those who invest here, [Crimea's status] has been decided,\" says director Alexei Kasprzhak. As the linchpin of the local economy, the tourist sector is also due a cash injection. Crimea's grey pebble beaches have always attracted Ukrainians, primarily. Now they have largely stopped travelling here, Russia has been busy promoting the peninsula as the \"patriotic choice\" for a holiday. \"We decided to come as soon as Crimea was ours again,\" Olga explains, adding that she and her son usually holiday in Bulgaria. \"But we wanted to be among the first here,\" she says, though like many she has been shocked by the high prices and admits they are unlikely to come back. \"We can't afford Soviet resorts anymore!\" Olga laughs. For locals too, the price hike under Russian rule has taken some adjustment, although salaries have also grown. But they say many of the other practical problems of living under sanctions are being addressed now. \"People had to make the transition, and it was total chaos,\" hostel owner Natalia Kyrychenko recalls, describing the difficulties of life in a territory that most of the world does not recognise. \"Gradually, normal service is being resumed.\" Most of her savings have finally been returned from a former Ukrainian bank; she has a new, Russian phone number and - with MasterCard working here once again - she can get back to online shopping. \"I am sure Crimea will be recognised and this situation won't go on for long,\" Natalia says, hopefully. But other businesses have been hit much harder by the new reality. Dmitry Semyonov used to sell wooden souvenir flasks and honey pots, mainly to buyers in the EU. With that key market off-limits, production in his former tractor-repair shop has all but stopped. He calls the annexation a \"catastrophe\". \"We were pulled out of Ukraine, but we didn't really join Russia,\" Dmitry says. \"We've just been left dangling. When it happened, they said don't worry, the Russian market will open for you. But just sticking on a 'made in Crimea' label gives you no preferences.\" So Dmitry and his wife have made the hardest choice of their life, to leave. An ethnic Russian, he plans to move his business to Ukraine, but that is not the only thing he is worried about. \"I don't even want to imagine how things will end here. But I don't want to be part of it. The fuse has been lit. We just don't know how long it will be before the situation explodes,\" the businessman warns. For all Vladimir Putin's efforts to draw a line under the Crimea question then, it remains far from resolved.

Twenty years ago, around the time the network was privatised, 1.45 billion clocked in and out. Last year, that figure had nearly doubled, to 2.75 billion. The CBT also says: The map also shows that growth has been uneven across Britain. London and the South East are booming. So are Leeds and Birmingham. But growth in Humberside's been thinner. Fun train facts Apropos of nothing other than giving you some good pub facts, here are some cracking things I read in Rail Magazine recently, based on a book called 'The Railways: Nation, Network and People' by Simon Bradley. Did you know that: \"Investment has tended to focus on relieving overcrowding in south east England, while leaving other parts of the country in a time warp,\" says the CBT's Andrew Allen. \"Our mapping shows areas which are strong candidates for growth and where targeted investment in better services and even new stations could make a real difference. The government needs to be braver, both in anticipating the potential for growth and in getting more places onto the network.\" This rapid expansion has left parts of the system unable to cope. Punctuality has been poor in recent years. We've got a Victorian network, ravaged by decades of underinvestment, which is only now being put right and is, understandably, struggling to squeeze in record numbers of people. No-one really saw this massive growth in numbers coming. When the conservatives privatised the system twenty years ago, just about everyone assumed they were managing the decline of train travel. And the rot set in a long time before that. More than 3,000 miles of track disappeared in the 1950s and the government still wanted to axe a lot more. The following decade, ministers asked a grey civil servant from the Isle of Sheppey, Dr Beeching, to come up with a blueprint for the future. He recommended axing another third of the network - 5,000 miles of track, including hundreds of branch lines and 2,363 stations. It was assumed we'd all use cars instead. But when I met him recently, the new chairman of Network Rail, Sir Peter Hendy was evangelical about the future. Money's going in. People are back. Services are better (mostly).

{"article": "Students, political activists and protesters - some as young as 14 - have vanished without a trace, according to a new report by Amnesty International. Many are alleged to have been held for months and often kept blindfolded and handcuffed for the entire period. Egypt's government has denied it uses enforced disappearances and torture. More than 1,000 people have been killed and 40,000 are believed to have been jailed since President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi led the military's overthrow of Mohammed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected head of state, in 2013. Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa director, Philip Luther, said enforced disappearances had become a \"key instrument of state policy\" under Mr Sisi and his Interior Minister, Magdy Abdul Ghaffar, who took office in March 2015. Citing local non-governmental organisations, Amnesty said that on average three to four people per day had been seized, usually when heavily armed security forces led by the National Security Agency (NSA) stormed their homes. Hundreds of people were thought to be held at the NSA's offices, inside the interior ministry's headquarters at Cairo's Lazoughly Square. Mr Luther said the report exposed collusion between the security services and judicial authorities, who he alleged had been \"prepared to lie to cover their tracks or failed to investigate torture allegations, making them complicit in serious human rights violations\". One of the cases in the report is that of 14-year-old Mazen Mohamed Abdallah, who was taken from his home in the Nasser City district of Cairo by NSA agents on 30 September and accused of being a member of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and participating in unauthorised protests. Mazen said that after he denied the charges, interrogators repeatedly raped him with a wooden stick in order to force him to \"memorise\" a false confession, applied electric shocks to his genitals and other parts of his body, and threatened to arrest his parents if he retracted the confession. The boy retracted the confession when questioned by a prosecutor, but was still charged and only released from custody on 31 January to await trial, Amnesty said. Another of the cases featured in the report is that of Italian student Giulio Regeni. The 28-year-old Cambridge University PhD student was found dead on a roadside on the outskirts of Cairo in February, his body bearing signs of torture. The Egyptian authorities have denied any involvement in his killing, but Amnesty said its report had found \"clear similarities\" between his injuries and those of Egyptians who had died in custody. Following the publication of the report on Wednesday, the Egyptian foreign ministry issued a statement accusing Amnesty of being a \"non-neutral organisation motivated by political stances aimed at tarnishing the image of Egypt\". It said the ministry \"would not comment\" further, but added that Amnesty's reporting was one-sided and expressed \"the viewpoints of individuals and parties hostile to the Egyptian state, while ignoring the Egyptian judiciary's handling of these cases\".", "question": "Egypt 's security services have forcibly made hundreds of people disappear and tortured them in the past year to try to tackle dissent , a rights @placeholder says .", "option_0": "media", "option_1": "organisation", "option_2": "association", "option_3": "body", "option_4": "group", "label": 4}

{"article": "Referee Mike Dean showed Feghouli a straight red card after the midfielder's 15th-minute challenge on Phil Jones. Replays showed it was more of a coming together between two players committed to winning the ball than a reckless tackle meant to cause harm. Antonio Valencia was guilty of an astonishing miss for the visitors before Juan Mata scored from 10 yards after a clever pass by fellow substitute Marcus Rashford. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was one of three players offside when he doubled the lead after Pedro Obiang's clearance fell to Ander Herrera. It was Jose Mourinho's side's sixth straight Premier League win and their seventh in all competitions. The Hammers have beaten Bournemouth, Sunderland, Burnley and Hull at home this season, yet their hopes of claiming a first major scalp at London Stadium were undone by the fastest sending off in the Premier League this season. There is no doubt Feghouli lost control of the ball and deserved a booking for his challenge on Jones. But Dean, who sent off Southampton's Nathan Redmond in the 4-1 defeat by Tottenham on Wednesday, brandished a red card for the fifth time this season, much to the fury of West Ham boss Slaven Bilic. Jones, who was clearly hurt and rolled over several times before receiving treatment, was booed by home fans for the rest of the game each time he touched the ball. Feghouli is now set to miss his side's FA Cup third-round home tie against Manchester City on Friday, while Hammers supporters showed their anger at the official by chanting 'Mike Dean - it's all about you'. In the second half, Dean kept his cards in his pocket after Cheikhou Kouyate's reckless challenge on Henrikh Mkhitaryan. This was far from vintage Manchester United, yet Mourinho's team started 2017 as they finished 2016 - with three points. They are now unbeaten in their past 13 games in all competitions, while they have taken 25 points from the last 33 on offer. Valencia will surely be haunted by his 36th-minute miss. It was a brilliant save by Darren Randolph to deny him from close range, but the Ecuador international should have buried the chance, as should Jesse Lingard, who hit the post with the follow-up. Mourinho's decisions to bring on Mata at the start of the second half and Rashford before the hour mark proved decisive. The pair combined to break West Ham's spirited resistance - the busy and menacing Rashford evading a couple of challenges before cutting back for Spaniard Mata to find the net. The 19-year-old England striker hit the post before Ibrahimovic, standing in an offside position, scored a controversial second to complete West Ham's misery. Beaten by Leicester City on Saturday, it has been a 48 hours to forget for West Ham in terms of results. However, they dug deep, displayed a steely resolve - and might even have got something from the game despite the visitors' extra-man advantage. David de Gea twice saved well from Manuel Lanzini, before Michail Antonio's glancing header flashed agonisingly wide as the Hammers threatened. And shortly before Mata broke the deadlock, Antonio found himself clean through after Lanzini's perfectly weighted pass, only for De Gea to block his effort. West Ham boss Bilic: \"I was pleased with the performance, we fought hard and gave everything. I told my players that if we did this we will be all right in the table. \"Ten men against a team like this is very hard - but we had chances. \"I am disappointed with the result and frustrated by how we lost it, but I am proud of my players.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Manchester United manager Mourinho: \"It was hard for us to think well with one more man - and it was very hard for them physically. \"I was happy with my choices in Juan Mata and Marcus Rashford, they gave us what we needed.

{"article": "After more than 200 years of tradition, Armagh Observatory is looking at moving to automation. In a world of changing climate and weather, it is perhaps comforting to know the way we log those changes progresses only slowly. For 18 years, Shane Kelly has been taking weather observations at 09:00 every day at the observatory in Northern Ireland. Daily weather readings taken manually at the site have advanced over time to include a full range of meteorological data including figures for temperature, wind, rainfall and sunshine. Shane feels the responsibility of keeping it going. \"Seeing as it's been unbroken for 200 years, I don't want to break that up and become infamous,\" he told the BBC. Possibly the biggest change in all those years is now on the cards as work has begun to automate the process. That means one day manual readings taken by the likes of Shane will come to an end. But Mr Kelly worries about the reliability of purely automated weather stations. \"Automatic weather stations break down and you might lose days and days of data until it is fixed,\" he said. Observatory Director Michael Burton showed me the archives that show how it all began, with the very first weather readings - taken in Fahrenheit, of course - from December 1794. At first it was just the pressure and temperature that was recorded - which interestingly, showed it was warmer outside than inside, The observations only became a permanent daily fixture in the summer of 1795, said Mr Burton. \"For the first few months, the readings were quite sporadic with some days missing so really, initially, this was just an experiment in learning how to measure the weather,\" he said.

{"article": "The think tank warns that it could devalue the \"brand\" of apprenticeships by turning it into \"just another term for training\". The government has a target of three million apprenticeships and is imposing a levy on employers to fund it. The Department for Education says standards are \"rigorously checked\". Report co-author Neil Amin-Smith says there is a \"desperate need\" for better vocational training - and the government's industrial strategy has emphasised the need to improve technical education. But the report warns the government has \"failed to make a convincing case for such a large and rapid expansion in apprenticeships\" and warns of \"wildly optimistic\" claims for how much extra earnings could be generated by the investment in apprentices. The analysis from the IFS casts doubt on the use of public money in the apprenticeships drive, funded by an employers' levy being introduced this spring which is expected to raise Â£2.8bn by 2019-20. The think tank warns that spending on apprenticeships will only increase by Â£640m, suggesting that most of the revenue raised will be spent elsewhere. The targets require an extra 600,000 apprentices per year, but the report says the incentives to hire apprentices could have the unintended consequence of deterring employers from paying to train their own employees. This could create \"considerable risks to the efficient use of public money\", says the study. There are also serious doubts about the wider impact. The study warns about the dilution of quality if other types of training are re-badged as apprenticeships. There is also a forecast that the cost of the employers' levy could push down wages for other workers. And the beneficiaries will not all be young school leavers - with the IFS report saying that almost half of the new apprentices are going to be over the age of 25. It also warns of a \"cavalier use of statistics\" in how the apprenticeships policy has been developed, which could undermine an otherwise \"perfectly sensible case for a gradual expansion of apprenticeships\". Labour's shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden said: \"Rushing to hit a three million target without sorting out the quality or increasing the proportion of apprenticeships under the age of 25 means they risk failing to deliver the long-term skills strategy we need.\" A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \"Quality is at the heart of all of our apprenticeship reforms. \"We have introduced new apprenticeship standards which are developed by employers themselves and rigorously checked and taken steps to protect the term apprenticeship from misuse helping us to achieve our target of three million apprenticeship starts by 2020 and providing excellent value for money.\"", "question": "The government 's target to rapidly increase the @placeholder of apprentices risks being \" poor value for money \" , says the Institute for Fiscal Studies .", "option_0": "number", "option_1": "risk", "option_2": "state", "option_3": "influx", "option_4": "wealth", "label": 0}

{"article": "President Barack Obama managed, during his recent African Union speech, to use almost 400 words to tell us that it is a good thing to have limits on presidential terms. The truth is many people on this continent do know this, despite President Pierre Nkurunziza's recent re-election in Burundi. African countries started independent and constitutional life with term limits clearly spelled out. But whenever they became inconvenient, parliaments simply amended the rules and the constitutions to allow third or fourth terms or declared Presidents for Life. Often, these amendments came with the enthusiastic support of academics, local and foreign, who found theories to support whatever changes the leader wanted. The theories ranged from African Socialism to Nkrumahism - the ideology based on the philosophy of Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah. At the heart of it all was the idea that a particular leader was special and without him, the country would disintegrate. Or, as Louis XV, who reigned France for almost 60 years, reportedly said \"apres lui, le deluge\" (after me, the flood). This was said about all the first presidents and even if they didn't start like this, they came to believe it themselves. The soldiers who staged the coups and ruled much of Africa in the 70s and 80s said it about themselves and sycophantic followers and academics for hire endorsed them. The freedom fighters who marched into the capitals and overthrew colonial powers or indigenous autocrats said so about themselves and proceeded to turn into worse dictators before our very eyes. Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire used to say it and so did Brother Muammar Gaddafi of Libya. Any criticism about having been in power for too long was answered with: They held their countries together. You had to wonder if it was possible that Mobutu's Zaire could possibly get any worse than it was under his corrupt rule. In the event, after he was ousted from power, we looked back with nostalgia. Much better to have the obscene opulence of Gbadolite, the city in the middle of nowhere, than the disaster that has been the Democratic Republic of Congo that followed the ousting of Mobutu. Likewise in Libya, better to have Muammar Gaddafi's Green Book of political pronouncements. Much better to have him crowned the King of Kings of Africa by traditional leaders and let him fund the African Union. And better surely to put up with his air-conditioned tents and long rambling speeches at the United Nations than the chaos that is today's Libya after he was overthrown. And if Obama had looked up the files just a few years back he would have found another US President, Bill Clinton, saying during his time that there was a \"new Africa\". Two leaders who were part of the new Africa of the Clinton years are now refusing to leave office in the Obama years. Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni used to be openly contemptuous of African leaders who cling to office. Next year, some 30 years after he marched into Kampala to chase out Milton Obote, he is proposing to stand for another term as president. Next door, an enthusiastic parliament has opened the path for Paul Kagame to stand for another term as president of Rwanda in case the great successes he has achieved are jeopardized by someone else taking his place. The West African leaders under the auspices of the regional body Ecowas (the Economic Community of West African States), tried to make a two-term limit for presidents binding on their members. They retreated quietly once Togo and The Gambia protested. I am told the unspoken answer these days to presidents not wanting to leave office in Africa is: \"DRC and Libya, or Mobutu and Gaddafi\".

{"article": "Kalev Leetaru has already uploaded 2.6 million pictures to Flickr, which are searchable thanks to tags that have been automatically added. The photos and drawings are sourced from more than 600 million library book pages scanned in by the Internet Archive organisation. The images have been difficult to access until now. Mr Leetaru said digitisation projects had so far focused on words and ignored pictures. \"For all these years all the libraries have been digitising their books, but they have been putting them up as PDFs or text searchable works,\" he told the BBC. \"They have been focusing on the books as a collection of words. This inverts that. \"Stretching half a millennium, it's amazing to see the total range of images and how the portrayals of things have changed over time. \"Most of the images that are in the books are not in any of the art galleries of the world - the original copies have long ago been lost.\" The pictures range from 1500 to 1922, when copyright restrictions kick in. Mr Leetaru began work on the project while researching communications technology at Georgetown University in Washington DC as part of a fellowship sponsored by Yahoo, the owner of photo-sharing service Flickr. To achieve his goal, Mr Leetaru wrote his own software to work around the way the books had originally been digitised. The Internet Archive had used an optical character recognition (OCR) program to analyse each of its 600 million scanned pages in order to convert the image of each word into searchable text. As part of the process, the software recognised which parts of a page were pictures in order to discard them. Mr Leetaru's code used this information to go back to the original scans, extract the regions the OCR program had ignored, and then save each one as a separate file in the Jpeg picture format. The software also copied the caption for each image and the text from the paragraphs immediately preceding and following it in the book. Each Jpeg and its associated text was then posted to a new Flickr page, allowing the public to hunt through the vast catalogue using the site's search tool. \"I think one of the greatest things people will do is time travel through the images,\" Mr Leetaru said. \"Type in the telephone, for example, and you can see that all the initial pictures are of businesspeople, and mostly men. \"Then you see it morph into more of a tool to connect families. \"You see another progression with the railroad where in the first images it was all about innovation and progress that was going to change the world, then you see its evolution as it becomes part of everyday life.\" Archivists said they were impressed with the project. \"Finding images within texts and tagging large collections of images are notoriously difficult,\" said Dr Alison Pearn, a senior archivist from the University of Cambridge and associate director of the Darwin Correspondence Project. \"This is a clever way of providing both quantity and searchability, and it's great that it is freely available for anyone to use. \"The image identification has picked up things like library stamps and scribbles in the margins, and the tagging is a bit hit and miss, but research has always been at least in part about serendipity, and who knows what people will find to do with them.\" Mr Leetaru's own ambition is a tie-up with the internet's most famous encyclopaedia once his project is completed next year. \"What I want to see is... Wikipedia have a national day of going through this to illustrate Wikipedia articles,\" he said. \"Take a random page about a historical event and there's probably a good chance that you're going to find an image in here that bears in some way on that event or location. \"Being able to basically enrich [them] would be huge.\" He added that he also planned to offer his code to others. \"Any library could repeat this process,\" he explained. \"That's actually my hope, that libraries around the world run this same process of their digitised books to constantly expand this universe of images.\"", "question": "An American academic is creating a searchable @placeholder of 12 million historical copyright - free images .", "option_0": "array", "option_1": "symbol", "option_2": "database", "option_3": "piece", "option_4": "picture", "label": 2}
{"article": "It wasn't that I wasn't good at my job, he assured me, it was just that I didn't have much personality. That was when I realised I was being fired. The anchor who was going to replace me, my boss said, simply had more on-air character. It was apples and oranges really, he added, with all the bedside manner of a limp fish. To this day, I'm not sure if I was the apple or the orange, but I do know you can't argue against being the wrong type of fruit. I was out, the new guy was in and my dreams of becoming a TV anchor were over. I welled up. And to this day kick myself for doing so. It's a not a big story of loss. In the scheme of life, being moved aside from a job, however much you love it, is a small thing. I have been lucky, indescribably lucky. So much so that I almost hesitate to write it down for fear of jinxing my good fortune. My four children are healthy, my husband is fit and well and my parents are still alive. I have not yet suffered the agony of losing a loved one - the death of my childhood hamster \"Pig\" doesn't really count. But it will happen, I know. My parents are 84 and 86 and I have a constant nagging dread of that midnight phone call. I'm afraid of grief. Will I be up to bearing the pain? How do you cope, every hour? One day I will find out. In the meantime my story of resilience is pedestrian. I am not sure I can even take from it many lessons for far greater challenges. But, for what it is worth, here is how I dealt with being fired and how it led to something better. I cried again, properly this time, in private. Once I'd retreated to the safety of the lockable changing room, my humiliation poured out, wet and snivelling. It made it no easier that my replacement was a friend who genuinely felt bad about the change in roles. I wish I could say I was angry. Who the hell was this man telling me I didn't have enough character? That I was a mouldy apple or an insipid orange. Why didn't I thump the table and put up a fight? Was I really that meek? But my overwhelming feeling was humiliation. Everyone would know, and talk about the fact that I'd failed. It would be breaking news in a newsroom full of \"who's up who's down\" obsessions. In retrospect that was my second mistake (the first were those unprofessional tears). I hadn't learned the lesson that none of us are other peoples' headlines for very long. People are far too wrapped up in their own lives to care about what's happening to other people. Even if it is a moment's hot gossip, it's only that - a moment. Pride almost got me out the door in a swirl of indignation. I desperately wanted a chance to reclaim the upper hand by quitting, ideally in a huff. I'm not sure what I hoped that would achieve - somehow my employers would realise the error of their ways and come grovelling, begging me to return? As if that was going to happen. They had made their calculations and their decision, a temper tantrum wasn't going to change that. Fortunately, a quick dose of the kind of reality that only comes with a visit to the ATM made me realise quitting was not an option available to me, and my rather large family. I needed to pay the bills. When the show's new editor offered me the job of political correspondent, I swallowed the temptation to tell him, and the network that had humiliated me to - in rather stronger terms - go away. I did say I needed some time to think about the offer, a small face-saving measure. Of course, I took the job. I didn't have much choice and maybe sometimes that's a good thing. I wasn't thrilled but I did it. And that's when something good happened, when failure became success. The year was 2007 and little did we know it but we were on the doorstep of one of the most exciting elections in history. Thanks to my new job, I got a front row seat. I crossed the country covering the race, first between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and then between Obama and McCain. It was the political story of a lifetime. It turned out I was really good at it. The experience stretched me and I rose to the challenge. I exercised reporting muscles I hadn't used before, became confident and quicker and smarter. And, yes, I developed a stronger, more authoritative on-air presence. My reporting was noticed, I got invited on US networks and my career took off. And here's the kicker, none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired. I would never have had the chance to do any of that reporting if I'd been stuck anchoring in the studio every night. I'm not going to thank the man who told me I had no character. I'm not that magnanimous, and he could do with lessons in people management. But I do realise something good came out of something bad and along the way I learned I can survive a setback.

The aim is to investigate the benefits of having a front garden filled with plants compared with one without any. Nearly one in four front gardens in the UK is completely paved over. \"Participating in this research, in terms of the wider picture, everyone will be part of what can hopefully be - depending on the results, of course - part of the evidence needed to bolster the social case for more green spaces and gardens in cities,\" she added. \"That argument will hopefully be able to act in concert with the environmental ecosystem benefits, which we already know.\" The ecological benefits of gardens are well-known. They include resilience to local flooding, habitat for wildlife and benefits for air quality. More recently, researchers have started compiling evidence for the effects of green spaces and gardens on well-being. This will be used to inform health and planning policy. The research is being carried out in collaboration with the Royal Horticultural Society.", "question": "A project aims to investigate the social case for gardens and what @placeholder they have on health and well - being .", "option_0": "announcing", "option_1": "amount", "option_2": "standards", "option_3": "shows", "option_4": "impact", "label": 4}
{"article": "An inquest found Mary Muldowney, 57, probably would have survived if she had been transferred for surgery more quickly. Doctors in Surrey had asked for an immediate transfer last July, but several units had no beds available. Her son, Sean, said the family did not want the same thing to happen to another patient. Ms Muldowney was first admitted to East Surrey Hospital with a suspected brain bleed. Doctors requested an immediate transfer to a neurosurgical unit after a scan showed heavy bleeding. Three units - St George's and King's College hospitals in London and the Royal Sussex in Brighton - refused. Other hospitals also said they had no available intensive care beds. The inquest heard Ms Muldowney was eventually transferred to Royal London Hospital after a Surrey doctor \"went out of area\" in \"desperation\", but surgery did not save her. Ms Muldowneys' daughter, Sharon Callan, said: \"It's really really upsetting to hear that your mum should and could be alive.\" Her son Sean added: \"Somebody needs to take responsibility for that, and unless somebody takes responsibility for that, and admits that there may have been a mistake somewhere along the line, you are not going to fix that error. That error will reoccur.\" Irwin Mitchell solicitor Leanne Leighton said: \"Her family want answers and to prevent it happening again.\" Ms Leighton said: \"The revelations at the inquest came as a shock to [the family]. \"They were not aware of the full extent of the issues surrounding the availability of a bed. That is what we are going to investigate.\" She added: \"Tragically it is too late for Mary but her family want to prevent it happening again to another family.\" Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust and St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust both said at the time of referral Ms Muldowney \"was not deemed to require life-saving surgery\". The Brighton hospital trust said it often took neurosurgical patients in emergency situations \"even if we have no beds available\", while St George's said it never \"refused emergency admissions that require specialist care for any reason\". King's College Hospital said patient transfers were only accepted \"when medical specialists have been consulted and it is clinically safe to do so\".

{"article": "It delivers 2.5 volts and can power a desktop calculator for 15 minutes. It could be used to keep military secrets confidential, and in environmental monitoring devices . Iowa State University mechanical engineering professor Reza Montazami said it was the first practical transient battery. While this particular battery could not be used in the human body as it contain lithium, researchers have been examining how batteries could dissolve harmlessly within the human body, and prevent the pain of removal, for several years. Prof Montazami developed the lithium-ion battery with a team of scientists who recently published details of their discovery in the Journal of Polymer Science, Part B: Polymer Physics. It measures 5mm in length, is 1mm thick and 6mm wide, and is similar to commercial batteries in terms of its components, structure and electrochemical reactions. It contains an anode, cathode and an electrolyte separator within two layers of polyvinyl alcohol-based polymer. When dropped in water, the battery's polymer casing swells and the electrodes are broken apart, causing it to dissolve. However, it contains nanoparticles which do not degrade, meaning it does not dissolve entirely. The entire process takes around half an hour. \"Unlike conventional electronics that are designed to last for extensive periods of time, a key and unique attribute of transient electronics is to operate over a typically short and well-defined period, and undergo fast and, ideally, complete self-deconstruction and vanish when transiency is triggered,\" the scientific paper stated. While it would be possible to create a more powerful battery, it would take longer to break down. Dissolvable batteries could play a part in helping to reduce the waste caused by discarded electronics. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are working on electronic circuit boards capable of dissolving in water.

Thursday's debate offered his rivals a chance to close the gap on the outspoken populist - but would they seize the opportunity? First they were forced to stand around looking awkward while the Fox News presenters waited for the green light. Once the beauty pageant was over, it was presenter Megyn Kelly who took aim at Mr Trump, asking him about derogatory comments he's made in the past about women. Mr Trump was having none of it though, insisting he'd only taken issue with one woman - liberal actress Rosie O'Donnell - before rallying against political correctness. The crowd loved it. Ms O'Donnell, presumably watching at home, was less enthused. Each of the candidates eventually got a chance to speak, although some of them took a less obvious line than others - like neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Jeb Bush, the early frontrunner who has slipped behind Mr Trump in recent polls, was eager to point out he was more than just another Bush. Unfortunately, he chose slightly ambiguous language. The audience were still scratching their heads when Ted Cruz popped up to say what America really needed was its own version of Egyptian strongman Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, which struck some as a bit odd. Mr Trump then reappeared to clarify his relationship with Democrat rival Hillary Clinton. Sure, he'd spoken to her husband on the phone and given money to her in the past, he told the audience, but he had an explanation. Around this point, a few of the candidates were finding it hard to get a word in. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker looked a little lost and Ben Carson seemed to have disappeared. Chris Christie and Rand Paul, however, were determined to be heard and went into battle against each other over mass surveillance and fighting terrorism. It got pretty personal pretty quickly. While the others caught their breath, Mr Trump returned to talk about building a wall along America's border with Mexico to tackle illegal immigrants. This is a favoured topic for the businessman but it was the first time he'd mentioned including \"a big beautiful door\" on the wall to let legal immigrants through. Earlier in the night, Rick Perry had been forced to deny saying \"Ronald Raven\" in the second-tier Republican debate - sending Twitter's meme-makers into meltdown.

{"article": "The San Francisco 49er's quarterback stayed seated as The Star-Spangled Banner played in a pre-game ceremony in protest against what he called the oppression of black people in the US. The gesture has provoked a huge reaction, with some applauding him as principled, others seeing him as disrespectful and unpatriotic. Here are some of the key responses. An often-repeated criticism of Kaepernick has been that his actions are offensive to members of the US military. Guidelines say all Americans should stand and face the flag during the anthem - by not doing so, as the argument goes, Kaepernick was insulting people prepared to die for it. Some former servicemen and women disagree, however, and have been offering their support using the #VeteransForKaepernick hashtag. However backing for Kaepernick among the US military is far from unanimous. In one widely shared response, Senior Airman Brian Kolfage, who lost three limbs in Iraq in 2004, said \"I'll be sure to stand for the both us\" next time the anthem played. Meanwhile the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States group said \"the American flag and our national anthem stand for something, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States salutes all who stand with us\". Angry fans of the 49ers have been posting videos of themselves burning Kaepernick jerseys. \"When you don't rise for the flag to show your respect for the men and women who fought and continue to fight for our freedom you start #losing #fans,\" wrote one. Kaepernick led San Francisco to the 2013 Super Bowl, but since then his status in the team has declined and he has lost his starting place. His team support his protest, saying \"we recognise the right of an individual to choose and participate, or not, in our celebration of the national anthem\". One man who knows what it is like to be attacked for making a political gesture at a sporting event is Tommie Smith, the US sprinter who famously raised his fist in protest against racial discrimination during his gold medal ceremony at the 1968 Olympics. Smith gave Kaepernick his backing. \"He's being vilified in how he brings the truth out,\" he told USA Today. \"I support him because he's bringing the truth out, regardless of how done. If it's not done violently, at least he should be heard.\" He suggested that Smith was only continuing a fight against systemic racism that was yet to be won. \"There are a lot of battles to fight because it's a big, long war,\" he said. The Republican presidential nominee gave a typically forthright response, calling Kaepernick's action a \"terrible thing\". \"Maybe he should find a country that works better for him,\" Mr Trump told KIRO radio in Seattle. \"Let him try. It won't happen.\" There has been no word yet from rival Hillary Clinton. Kaepernick himself is no fan of either candidate. Asked whether he had deliberately timed the protest to coincide with election year, he said both \"represent the issue that we have in this country right now\". He went onto call Mr Trump \"openly racist\" and cited Mrs Clinton's description of black children as \"super-predators\". In his reaction, Jerry Rice, who won three Super Bowl championships while with the 49ers, took a similar line to many, backing Kaepernick's freedom to express himself while disagreeing with the method. But three little words made Rice himself come under fire. The phrase \"All Lives Matter\" has proved hugely toxic, with critics saying those who use the phrase are at best missing the point of the debate, at worst being outright racist. Kaepernick has been a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and referenced police brutality in explaining his action. The row has triggered a complex debate about free speech and patriotism, the sport and the military, and for some commentators was a chance to examine the meaning of the Star Spangled Banner itself. The anthem is best known for its opening verse, which is normally the only one sung. It was written in 1814 by Francis Scott Key, after witnessing the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Baltimore. But a lesser known third verse, which has the line \"no refuge could save the hireling and slave\" is often interpreted as celebrating the deaths of slaves who died siding with the British. Writing in the Root, Jason Johnson calls the song \"one of the most racist, pro-slavery, anti-black songs in the American lexicon\".", "question": "When American football player Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem , he unleashed a storm of controversy that shows no @placeholder of dying down .", "option_0": "sign", "option_1": "parts", "option_2": "millions", "option_3": "experience", "option_4": "rudiments", "label": 0}
{"article": "The session will be held in September to select new leaders for the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), the North Korean Central News Agency said. Analysts say the move may signal a transition of power in the secretive country. Leader Kim Jong-il is believed to be in ill health and grooming one of his sons, Kim Jong-un, to succeed him. The meeting is \"for electing [the party's] highest leading body reflecting the new requirements of the WPK\", the announcement said. \"We are now faced with the sacred revolutionary tasks to develop the WPK... into an eternal glorious party of Kim Il-sung and further increase its militant function and role to glorify the country as a great prosperous and powerful socialist nation.\" Kim Jong-il took over as leader from his father, North Korea's founder Kim Il-sung, after his death in 1994. With Kim Jong-il thought to be in ill health following a suspected stroke in 2008, analysts believe the conference will be held to elevate the status of his third son, Swiss-educated Kim Jong-un. Earlier this week the director of South Korea's National Intelligence Service said that the 27-year-old is already taking a role in policy-making and frequently accompanies his father on inspection tours. The BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says Kim Jong-il himself began his official role to succeed his father by assuming a senior party position at a convention in 1980. The announcement comes a day after the 60th anniversary of the beginning of the three-year war between North and South Korea. It also follows a warning from the United States to North Korea to refrain from \"actions that increase tensions in the region,\" amid concerns that Pyongyang may be preparing a new round of missile tests. The US state department said it was aware North Korea had issued a nine-day ban on shipping off its western coast.

Ladbrokes also confirmed that it has a £3m liability if Leicester City win the Premier League. Despite this, the company said it had seen an encouraging start to the year. Revenue was more than 10% higher. Chief executive Jim Mullen said: \"At Cheltenham we were reminded of the intense competition with offers and pricing at levels which, in our view, abandoned bookmaking principles. \"We competed hard but refused to pursue unsustainable strategies.\" He told the BBC gambling was for his customers, not his business: \"I've always said we're in the gambling business, we don't gamble... I thought Cheltenham was a race to the bottom.\" The company said the Grand National winner, Rule The World, which was a 33/1 shot, delivered a welcome contrast to Cheltenham. Ladbrokes said it was \"confident\" that its results would be in line with expectations. Last year Ladbrokes announced plans to merge with its smaller rival, Coral. UK competition authorities are currently looking at the deal. Steve Clayton, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said the latest trading statement from Ladbrokes was encouraging, but the real issue was whether the merger with Coral would be allowed: \"A merged Ladbrokes and Coral will have a dominant retail position, even if many shops have to be sold off. \"We expect substantial cost saving will be possible because there will be vast areas of overlap and unnecessary duplication of functions across the combined business.\" Ladbrokes is pursuing a different strategy to that of its competitors by focussing on customer service and the occasional punter, who will not necessarily hunt for the best odds. Mr Clayton said: \"The bookmaker's strategy is to focus on the 'recreational punter', in other words the still soft and malleable, unhardened gamblers out there. \"These people do not know what the right odds should be, so it is easier to build a fat win margin into the bookmaker's terms.\"", "question": "Bookmaker Ladbrokes has said this year 's Cheltenham Festival was its \" worst in @placeholder memory \" .", "option_0": "living", "option_1": "response", "option_2": "mainland", "option_3": "training", "option_4": "history", "label": 0}
{"article": "He is a director of football whose heart is still out on the pitch, and he casts his mind back almost three decades to the opportunity he was given when he first set foot in the club as a new boy plucked from non-league. He chuckles as he recalls telling the QPR manager in 1987, Jim Smith, that he couldn't join straight away as he had to work his month's notice as a van driver. \"I remember there were some guys who were just about to be released,\" Ferdinand, 48, recalls. \"They were saying, 'do you know, I might go and play non-league football. Two nights' work and still get paid £150 a week for playing'. \"I said: 'Are you guys mad? Are you seriously saying that? You have got to try your nuts off to stay in football! You don't believe what you have got'.\" The former England striker is a man with a stock of stories to tell about the precarious business of opportunities in the game: how they come about, how they can so easily slip through a player's fingers, how they can be nurtured - and seized. Reflecting on his own playing career and coaching experience, his is a voice worth listening to carefully at a time when Football Association chairman Greg Dyke is trumpeting ideas to find a host of English players like Harry Kane. Ah, Harry Kane. Having watched Kane and his Tottenham team-mates Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend celebrating together for England in Turin during the week, Ferdinand argues that the line between that happy picture and talent drifting unharnessed in the modern game could not be thinner. Kane, Mason and Townsend came through the development squad together at Spurs under the tutelage of Ferdinand, current QPR manager Chris Ramsey and Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood. \"But I guarantee you now, had Tim, Chris and myself not taken over the first team, nobody would be talking about Kane, Mason and Townsend. Because we gave them the opportunity to play,\" stresses Ferdinand. \"They would not be playing at Tottenham otherwise. Andros went out on nine loans. Harry had four loans. Mason had five loans. They were no nearer the first team when they came back than when they went out on loan. It was only that we had been working with them and we knew we could put them in the first team and trust them. \"The average lifespan at any club for managers now is 11-12 months maximum. They haven't got time to think about player development.\" For all the talk of quotas to clear the pathway for youngsters, as far as Ferdinand is concerned there is a much more immediate problem for players getting stuck in the system. It's that critical age between 16 and 21 that Arsene Wenger pinpointed this week. \"That's the heart of the problem,\" said the Arsenal manager. \"Let's get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating those players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. Today you have to be very brave to integrate the young players because the pressure is very high.\" That sentiment strikes a chord with Ferdinand. He understands why managers are loath to take a risk on a young player. But the system, he reckons, makes it extra difficult to take those risks. Why? Because youngsters at the top clubs are starved of competitive football at the highest level. The under-21 league, introduced by the Premier League as part of their Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP) in place of old-style reserve-team football, is far too sterile for his liking. Ferdinand would scrap it in a heartbeat. \"It's not competitive enough,\" he says. \"Look at our squad. For the previous manager here [Harry Redknapp] if there was a problem in the first team he wasn't looking at the under 21s. He would rather go and take someone on loan who he knows has played competitive football against seasoned pros. \"That's what 99% of managers in the Premier League would do. They don't see the under-21 squad as being competitive enough, which is why these boys are not coming through.\" Ferdinand recalls his early days as a QPR player whisked out of non-league football. \"My first reserve game we had Clive Walker, Sammy Lee... all these experienced professional players. We played Southampton and they had Jimmy Case playing.\" His expression reveals that was an early lesson to the physical demands required. \"I am not going to get better experience than that. I am certainly not going to get it in the under-21s. \"These people helped you, they guided you through your football. In the under-21s if you have another kid telling you to push in here or there, they are not quite sure what they are doing. \"The other thing that happened is if you didn't play on Saturday you knew you were playing on Tuesday in the reserves, it didn't matter how big a player you were. And they didn't have the hump because it wasn't seen as a punishment. It was about keeping yourself fit to play football. \"Nowadays the senior players in the under-21 development games see it is a punishment. They don't want to play. So they end up not running around as they should do. \"Because I worked in under-21 football I understand that these players need to be given an opportunity. Otherwise you just have a creche. It is a bit messed up. They have to look at the whole picture.\" Given the complicated mix of stifled opportunity plus a generous salary - and all that at a sensitive age in between the teens and being a young adult - it doesn't seem to be the most productive environment. Intriguingly, when Ferdinand looks at his own chance as a young player, he admits he found it difficult to get his head around what was happening - and that was without agents in his ear and megabucks in his pocket. One day he was at Southall and Hayes, training twice a week after work and playing on the weekend. The next he was in the professional game. \"Instead of doing it for fun, suddenly it was my job. I struggled with that for a while,\" Ferdinand says. \"I needed to change my lifestyle and I didn't. I was a young kid from a council estate and was still running around with the guys I had been running around with before I joined QPR. It all happened very quickly. \"It took a while to adjust to the life of being a professional footballer. The truth is I probably didn't adjust to it until I went to Turkey, to Besiktas on loan in 1988. \"It was amazing not only as a football lesson but as a life lesson. I was on my own, the first British player to go to Turkey, in this environment I totally didn't know about. But I needed to do it. \"I realised I did want to be a professional footballer and I needed to get away from distractions and concentrate 100% on football. That's what Turkey allowed me to do. It was the making of me as a footballer. I feel that was me serving my apprenticeship.\" Ferdinand is a big believer in loans as long as the player himself is in the right mindset. \"People often go on loan and think, 'I'm here for a month. If it doesn't go that well it doesn't matter I'll go back to QPR or Arsenal or Tottenham or wherever. I don't really want to be here anyway…'\" But players need to believe that loan will actually lead somewhere, rather than feeling they are just farmed out. The 22-year-old Ferdinand returned to QPR from Besiktas in 1989 - having scored 19 goals in 30 games - and never looked back. He was one of a generation that also included Ian Wright and Stuart Pearce that made the full journey from non-league to an England shirt. The current crop of Premier League players who have their their roots in non-league - the likes of QPR's Charlie Austin, Burnley's Danny Ings, Dwight Gayle of Crystal Palace, Liverpool's Rickie Lambert and Jamie Vardy of Leicester - prove that the EPPP is not the only way to mould top level players. \"Coming in here to work every day is much better than getting up at 6am, working all day, having to jump on two trains and two buses to get to training,\" Ferdinand adds. \"The boys that come out of non-league appreciate what they have.\" That's another big part of the development issue - today's youngsters in the academy system are so well looked after their hunger can be eroded. \"That's a conversation that has been going on for many, many years,\" says Ferdinand. \"How do we change the mindset of boys that have been brought up in the system because they believe this is life? It is their life. It is what they have got used to. So it's very difficult to tell them about another way when that is all they have seen. \"I know at all clubs education has become a major part of what they do. But it doesn't really give you the life experience. Maybe sending them out to work for a few months, to get up at six in the morning or maybe even earlier to go and do a day's work, might help them to appreciate what they have got.\" Ferdinand laughs at such old-fashioned idealism in the middle of modern, £5bn industry. But it is an interesting idea. Anything and everything needs to be taken into consideration in the hunt for the next batch of Harry Kanes.", "question": "Les Ferdinand is sitting in his office at QPR 's Harlington training @placeholder in his club tracksuit , straight from a stint with the players .", "option_0": "district", "option_1": "ground", "option_2": "camp", "option_3": "event", "option_4": "room", "label": 1}

Negative portrayals of west Africa are part of the reason he played no part in the charity single. Ghana itself, where the 27-year-old was raised, has not had any reported Ebola cases.

Rarely has anyone been so dedicated and enthusiastic as Ken Davies was during his career as a TV news cameraman. He was on call 24/7, driven by the real newshounds urge to \"get the story\" and ensure that BBC and S4C News got it first. His contacts were second to none. Originally from the tiny seaside village of Cwmtydu in south Ceredigion, Ken Davies established a photographic studio and camera shop in Carmarthen in the 1960s. He shortly started filming mute 16mm black-and-white footage for BBC News. By the early 1980s he had his own camera crew covering news stories for BBC Wales Today and Newyddion on S4C. As film gave way to video in news gathering, Ken embraced the new technology with relish. During the 1980s I accompanied Ken to countless second home fires in the early hours of the morning during the Meibion GlyndÅµr arson campaign; waded waist deep through surging flood water to reach the tragic scene of the Glanrhyd rail disaster near Llangadog in 1987. We were spat at by flying pickets and harassed by police officers who did not know us during the miners' strike, left a hippy camp in a hurry accompanied by a shower of stones and bottles, and braved hypothermia to reach trapped villages during the great snows and -20C temperatures of 1981-82. Getting the best pictures could mean risking life and limb. On one occasion, Ken got trapped on the wrong side of a boundary fence during a massive blaze at a Pembrokeshire oil refinery and was lucky to escape alive. We would race to video inject points at TV masts near Aberystwyth, Crymych and Llanllawddog to send footage \"down the line\" to Cardiff, determined to keep our record of never missing a single deadline. I do not think viewers realised the quite heroic effort made by news crews to get the story on screen in an era where news was led more by events than issues. Ken Davies did not suffer fools gladly and could be quite sharp at times to those less dedicated and hard-working than himself.

Philip Hammond said some of the assumptions behind the document - which suggested a significant drop in economic growth - had been superseded by events. Those close to the chancellor made it clear the models were not wrong for the time, but the circumstances had now changed. It is also clear that Treasury officials still believe that there will be an economic slowdown as Britain negotiates its exit from the EU, a position backed by the Bank of England. \"The analysis that the Treasury published in April was based on a specific set of assumptions and it looked at three potential outcomes - they are stylised scenarios,\" Mr Hammond said. \"It did so - as I think modelling inevitably does - against a set of assumptions. \"Some of those assumptions have already proved to be invalid.\" Mr Hammond said that events were not following the path the models supposed. Firstly, the government did not immediately trigger Article 50 to start the two-year process for leaving the EU. Secondly, the models proposed for Britain's future relationship with the EU were too \"fixed\" and that Britain was looking for a \"bespoke deal\". The Treasury model looked at different arrangements, from the UK becoming a member of the European Economic Area - the Norway model - to having a relationship with the EU based on World Trade Organization tariffs. It said that each of them would have a detrimental effect on the British economy. Mr Hammond also questioned the validity of the Treasury's \"immediate economic impact\" document published last May. The chancellor said the Treasury modelling did not allow for what are called \"dynamic responses\", such as the Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates following the referendum. \"The Bank of England has already taken actions which mitigate the impact,\" Mr Hammond said. He has already argued that the UK economy is in robust shape, although Britain will face challenges ahead. In part, Mr Hammond is stating the obvious - models are only true for a certain time and are only, at best, a judgement on what may happen to complicated economic and political relationships. But, given that one of those Treasury documents contained the controversial estimate that, by 2030, households would be £4,300 worse off compared to the situation if Britain stayed in the EU, Mr Hammond is signalling he doesn't have much time for that analysis any more.

{"article": "Two former senior advisers to the Scottish government have authored a paper for the Fraser of Allander economic research institute. They state that it is \"impossible to carry on as normal\" after Brexit. Economy Secretary Keith Brown welcomed the paper, saying access to the single market was \"absolutely vital\". He said parties across the political spectrum should re-examine their policies in light of the referendum result, but insisted that \"the fundamentals of our strategy are sound\". The report was penned by Graeme Roy, former head of policy for the first minister and now director designate of Fraser of Allander, and Andrew Goudie, who was chief economic adviser to the Scottish government. They suggest that exports, promotion and incentives for inward investment need to be part of the review. They suggest bringing forward the creation of overseas trade and investment hubs, as well as planned cuts to Air Passenger Duty, and there is also a call for new measures to encourage recruitment of international students. The report is aimed mainly at the Scottish government and Holyrood opposition parties, but parts of it are also directed at Westminster. The Â£1bn figure for economic development is in addition to spending on education and skills and regeneration. The reports authors wrote: \"All of the government's economic strategy priorities - internationalisation, innovation, investment and inclusive growth - have been turned on their head by the decision to leave the EU. \"It is simply not possible to continue as normal. An urgent review of current policy initiatives is needed. \"Brexit is of a scale so significant that policymakers need to also consider the totality of their approach to economic growth. \"The challenges that we will face - and the opportunities that may arise - will require different policy responses and Scotland needs to be flexible and respond to the new environment. \"It is imperative that everyone - from across the political spectrum - revisits their economic priorities in the light of the referendum. There is a cross-party obligation to understand the shortcomings of existing stances: all require re-direction for the massive challenges that have arrived.\" Those arguing for the UK to leave the European Union were sunnily optimistic about the possibilities that could follow. Having won, they're rather quieter about all that. Some sectors are already cashing in. This isn't such a bad time to be in public affairs, though it would be more helpful if it were possible to advise clients on what's going on inside government. Even those who are inside don't seem to know. Lawyers will surely do well, as contracts have to be unravelled. And if you have any experience of negotiating trade deals, Sajid Javid wants to hear from you. He's creating a team of 300 to re-shape Britain's trading relationships, post-Brussels.

Much of what they say is to warn about Brexit implications for current government strategy. It doesn't need to be ripped up and started again, but it does need to be comprehensively reviewed. And opposition parties have to do likewise to their priorities. The key to the positive end of Brexit is to be \"clear and sharp\" in economic strategic thinking, say the Fraser of Allander duo. That may require less focus on the constitutional questions. \"If Scotland's political leaders can be quick-footed, there is an opportunity to take advantage of the current uncertainty, move ahead of other parts of the UK and signal that the country is open to business, trade and investment\". In other words, Whitehall's crisis can be Holyrood's opportunity. The authors question whether the relatively-high level of spending on economic development provides value for money, and why Scotland continues to have a low business start-up rate. They question whether the removal of 'Brussels red tape' after the Brexit from the EU will mean changes to employment law which could undermine the high priority given in Scotland to reduce inequality, boost worker rights and and fair work contracts and conditions. They suggest that duplication should be identified and removed. The more efficient programmes should be prioritised along with those that have the best prospects after the UK leaves the EU. While it remains top priority for the economy to retain access to the European single market, the Fraser of Allander paper questions what comes next - a Scottish points-based migration system, the future of employment rights, changes to farm subsidy and what further powers should the Scottish government seek to gain from Westminster as part of the Brexit process. In recent days, business representatives have met with Scottish government ministers and David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland. On Friday, he issued a letter to the 'big six' business lobby groups, underlining his emphasis on getting the whole UK to work together on Brexit talks, and intends to meet the first minister next week, after which he has set out hopes for a joint approach to working together with business leaders on post-Brexit plans. Responding to the paper, Economy Secretary Keith Brown said he hoped \"those right across the political spectrum look at their policies in light of the EU referendum result\", but insisted that \"the fundamentals of our strategy are sound\". He said: \"Scotland's economy is fundamentally strong, but continued EU status and our place in the world's biggest single market is absolutely vital when it comes to protecting jobs, investment and long-term-prosperity, which is why we are committed to pursuing every possible avenue to maintain our place in the EU. \"Trade and business continues as normal and we are determined that Scotland will continue now and in the future to be an attractive and a stable place to do business.\"", "question": "An academic think - @placeholder has called on Scotland 's political parties to carry out an urgent review of economic policies in the wake of the EU vote .", "option_0": "tank", "option_1": "shaped", "option_2": "party", "option_3": "based", "option_4": "backed", "label": 0}
{"article": "Rachid Redouane has been named as one of three men who carried out the attack on London Bridge on Saturday. Police say he is of Moroccan and Libyan descent. Redouane is understood to have been carrying an Irish identification card when he was shot dead. The attack in London was the third terror attack in the UK in three months, following the car and knife attack on Westminster Bridge in March, in which five people were killed, and the Manchester bombing on 22 May, in which 22 people were killed. It has been established that Redouane, who was a chef, had lived for a time in south Dublin, and also used the name Rachid Elkhdar. He had not been known to police in the UK or in Ireland. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports that 30-year-old Redouane married a British woman in Ireland in 2012 before moving back to the UK. RTÉ also understands the couple returned to Ireland for a short time in 2016 before separating. An Garda Síochána (Irish police) detectives suspect he may have been married to a 38-year-old woman who was taken into custody in the UK. Police arrested 12 people in the aftermath of the attack; all have been released without charge. Outgoing Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny said the man was not one of a small number of people in Ireland being monitored by authorities \"in respect of radicalisation\". Speaking in Chicago, Mr Kenny said that under European Union treaties, Ireland grants working visas to people from outside the EU who are in a relationship with an EU citizen. That appeared to have been the case regarding Redouane, although this was being checked, added Mr Kenny. While he said the common travel area was important and should be retained, the taoiseach said there was daily and sometimes hourly contact between the Irish authorities and their counterparts in Britain and Europe. After the Manchester bombing, Mr Kenny said he called a meeting of various groups including the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the (Irish) Defence Forces and officials involved in health, transport and aviation. \"There was a full review of Ireland's readiness\" under way, he added. The threat assessment level in Ireland at the moment is \"moderate\", meaning an attack is possible but unlikely. The Irish Department of Justice said: \"The level of threat from this source is kept under constant and active review by An Garda Síochána. \"The commissioner makes an assessment based on a range of factors including current available intelligence, knowledge of capabilities, events outside the State and the current international climate.\" Dr Umar al Qadri, of the Irish Muslim Peace and Integration council, told RTE he had warned the authorities two years ago, that there were extremists in Ireland. \"I know a number of other individuals, who are still living in Ireland, that are spreading their hatreds, spreading their hate narratives, on social media as well as off-line,\" he said. Suspected extremists should be monitored by the justice department, he said, but this was not enough. \"I think these people need professional help, they need to be de-radicalised,\" he said. Redouane's Irish identification has raised questions about the country's immigration controls. In December 2016, the head of the police in Northern Ireland told Westminster's NI Affairs Committee: \"Immigration controls into the Republic of Ireland may not have the same resource and focus that we would be seeing in Northern Ireland.\" PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton was giving evidence on the future of the Irish border after Brexit. Mr Hamilton said there was good co-operation and exchange of information between the PSNI and the Irish authorities. But he added that access to the Republic of Ireland might not have \"the immigration checks that we would have in Northern Ireland or, indeed, more broadly in the United Kingdom.\" Meanwhile, specially trained officers from the PSNI have been involved in providing help to police colleagues dealing with the attacks in both Manchester and London. Following the terrorist incident in London, 10 police officers supported the Metropolitan Police on the dedicated helpline by taking calls from concerned members of the public. After the bomb at the Manchester concert on 22 May, four of the PSNI's hostage and crisis negotiators travelled to the city to help officers in Greater Manchester Police with their investigation and arrest operations over three days.

{"article": "Pope Francis' trip this weekend to the Greek island of Lesbos, which hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants have used as a stepping stone in their trip to northern Europe, clearly emerges from the Pope's own personal desire. Migrants and refugees have always occupied a central part of his discourse - and so has his criticism of the way developed countries have dealt with this crisis. \"All too often,\" he said recently of migrants, \"[they] meet along the way with death or, in any event, rejection by those who could offer them welcome and assistance.\" In two speeches - at the Moira refugee centre and at the Mytilene port - Pope Francis is set to urge leaders and societies to show more compassion for those fleeing war and poverty. But more than anything, the short visit is seen as hugely symbolic - and if you look at Pope Francis' travel record, it seems that for him, making an appearance is enough of a message. In July 2013, his first trip outside Rome after being elected pontiff was to Lampedusa, the tiny Italian island off the coast of Libya that - like Lesbos - was becoming a symbol of the incipient migrant crisis. The visit occurred months before the attention of the world turned to the deadly crossing between Libya and Italy. Ever since then, it became clear that travelling to the front line of a conflict would become a recurring feature of Pope Francis' travel agenda. And it has also become obvious that the Vatican is increasingly aware of the symbolic power that the Pope has - and the global media attention that comes with a visit by one of the world's most popular leaders. So the Pope is also using his seemingly unrivalled media power to shed light on certain conflicts around the world - even if this means pushing the boundaries on the definition of papal travel. Take his trip last November to the Central African Republic (CAR), one of the poorest countries in the world, ravaged by more than three years of armed conflict between Christians and Muslims. For months after the Vatican first announced the trip, observers insisted that it posed too high a security risk for the Pope himself and the crowds that were expected to greet him in Bangui. After all, never before had a pope visited an active war zone. Pope Francis, oblivious to calls to reconsider, went ahead with the trip - visiting a mosque and camp for displaced people, holding a mass at the cathedral and calling on factions to lay down their weapons. After the papal plane left the conflict has continued, but the visit did bring an enormous amount of media coverage to a conflict that ranks amongst the most under-reported war of our times. It was the \"Francis effect\", in full form. In 2014, moved by news of the savage murder by the mafia of a three-year-old child in the southern Italian region of Calabria, he travelled to the remote village of Cassano allo Ionio. At the stronghold of the local crime syndicate known as 'Ndrangheta, the Pope issued a strong message to mobsters: you are all excommunicated. And his words reverberated across the Italian peninsula, where the mafia continues to expand its tentacles. Full of standout moments too was his presence at the fence between Mexico and the United States earlier this year, or his visit to Cuba in September last year, where he supported the historic thawing of the island's relationship with the United States. But is there anything more than pure symbolism in the Pope's travels? Sometimes his attempts to mediate in international conflicts are seen as naive, if not somewhat clumsy. During his trip to the Holy Land in May 2014, at the end of a mass at Bethlehem's Manger Square, he broke the news that he was inviting the then Israeli President Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to a \"day of prayer\" at the Vatican. A few weeks later, the event did take place and under the eye of the world's media the three leaders - joined by the Patriarch of Constantinople Bartholomew - shared a slightly awkward photo opportunity, during which they planted an olive tree in the Vatican Gardens. It is difficult to establish what concrete, on-the-ground effect - if any - such a gesture had on the decades-long conflict in the Middle East. But, ignoring the sceptics, this Pope seems keen to continue his policy of getting involved in continuing crises - visiting hotspots in what he calls the \"peripheries\" of the world and issuing strong calls for more mercy for the downtrodden. This weekend's trip to Lesbos is clearly emblematic of this approach.

{"article": "The cancer care charity has been staging fundraising cultural crawls in cities across the UK for a decade, but this was the first in Glasgow. BBC Scotland's arts correspondent Pauline McLean joined in on the cultural adventure. At 18:00 we gather outside the Riverside Museum in Glasgow. We're given water, oat biscuits and pizza slices as well as peach-coloured Maggie's T-shirts. \"I'm walking for\" ...reads the speech bubble on the back. \"Mum\", someone ahead of me has added. Several speakers give us words of encouragement. Lee Ann Mitchell has the moves as well as the words and we launch into a warm-up Zumba class. Policeman Alan wins a cheer from the crowd when he joins the team onstage. The Proclaimers' Five Hundred Miles has us stomping around the forecourt crashing into each other. Hopefully our navigation skills will improve, or one or two of us will end up in the Clyde before the night is out. A piper plays us off, as we stride purposefully down the riverbank. At 19:30 it's back to work for me as we arrive in the BBC Scotland reception, where a choir is singing and tea and cakes are being handed out. The building is lit in green and purple in tribute to Maggie's centres around the world - including the one we'll end up at later. People are doing the walk for many different reasons. Some have cancer themselves, or know people with cancer who've understood the benefits of well-designed centres for cancer care (just as Maggie Keswick Jencks thought when she was diagnosed. The first centre, named in her honour, opened a year after she died in 1996). One lady is celebrating her 60th birthday. Another is part of a fundraising team, and there are plenty of folk just doing it for fun, to see a city at night, alive with all sorts of possibilities. Being out in the dark on the river bank is empowering. Several car loads of young folk shout encouragement, tooting their horns as they pass. We stride along the Broomielaw, and cut up Buchanan street to the Gallery of Modern Art where members of the Connect Choir are singing their hearts out. We stop to listen for while, but we're anxious to keep moving (not least because we're at the back of the pack) and the choir applaud us as we leave. It's a strange experience. We haven't done anything but keep on walking. It's a nice feeling, though, and we leave like we're walking on air. If only that feeling could last. Shortly after 21:00 we are walking through the Merchant City. Several people try to entice us into clubs or restaurants. A man asks if we're on a hen party. I suppose it's the matching T-shirts. We arrive at Tennent's brewery in the East End. I've been before, but never out of hours. It's not just the offer of lager and crisps which feels illicit, it's being escorted past the vintage \"lager lovely\" can collection, upstairs to their vintage bar-room when no-one else is in the building. No-one else but Scandiwegians Scandi - who're giving it laldy with their brand of traditional music. Getting going again is a challenge and we're beginning to feel a little weary. Or maybe that's the beer. It's a long way across the city centre to Kelvingrove Park, but the newly restored bandstand is a sight for sore eyes - and its stone benches, a seat for sore legs. We stock up on home-baked goodies and settle down for some music, some close-up magic, and some nostalgia in the park. It's warm enough to stay put under the stars but we get moving again. There's an extra stop at Glasgow University where we're invited to stroll through the cloisters, and stand at the flagpole looking down on the city's glittering lights. It's 30 years ago this month since I first arrived here as a wide-eyed student. It's a place I know well - but even I don't recognise this stunning location in its night-time glory. It's close to 23:00 and it is downhill to the Botanic Gardens, past Friday night drinkers coming home from the pubs on Byres Road. We stumble into the Kibble Palace and a gentle performance of the gamelan - a traditional instrument from Java. Or instruments - for the gamelan is made of many different instruments and requires a whole team of musicians. There are traditional mats on the floor - but several of us worry if we sit on them we won't be able to stand up again. I have an overwhelming urge to lie down and sleep beneath the stars and the glass roof with the gently pealing bells and drums. But no, there's one last mile to walk. It's close to midnight as we walk along Great Western Road. The elegant terraces seem to go on forever and every step is another ache but there are Maggie's volunteers to urge us onwards and even the odd toot from a passing motorist. It's with light hearts and heavy boots that we walk the final steps into Maggie's Gartnavel. Having been presented with a medal, and a welcome glass of fizz, my friend Jan Patience and I find seats on a little terrace overlooking the gardens. As we toast our tiredness, and feel a cool breeze in our hair, we're both glad this little corner - designed by Rem Koolhas - exists. That Maggie's centres across the globe exist - to offer a little hope to those a lot heavier in heart.

{"article": "Faith spent four-and-a-half hours playing dead in the mall while keeping her young children quiet, before they were all finally rescued by a Kenyan policeman, Iyad Adan. She spoke to the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse about her experience that day: \"We walked in looking for the florist. We heard this very loud sound 'bang'. I thought the building was collapsing and the best thing to do is to lie in the open area. I just told the children: 'Lie down, lie down'. I thought it must just be a normal robbery and within five to six minutes it will be over. But then time just passed and we were waiting to hear: 'OK, get up they have gone.' But nothing of the sort. It seemed like something worse than I thought. My daughter was praying very loudly and she was saying: 'Jehovah, Jehovah, please protect us'. I was also praying but quietly and I felt my daughter was too loud and perhaps she would give away our position and so I just asked her to lower her volume. I didn't know what was happening but I knew at that point I was to direct my children to just stay still. \"I was worried about my son because he is only 21 months. We had had breakfast at about nine o'clock. I knew he must be hungry. I started thinking: 'Oh, my goodness Jehovah, this boy will wake up and he will start crying. I put my fingers in his mouth, he comforted himself and he just kept quiet. There was a lot of broken glass around us and and chipped concrete from the pillars. I picked that up and I was playing with it. He really loves insects, so I pretended that was in insect. I took one piece of glass, saying: 'Look, dudu' - dudu is a Swahili word for an insect. I said: 'Ty, look. Dudu is coming to bite you.' That would scare him a little and so he would keep quiet. And we played that game for almost an hour. It was amazing he just kept still. At some point when they came too close and I could smell the gunpowder and I could hear the bullet casings dropping on the ground, then I knew we were finished. That's the point when I started singing a song about the resurrection because I thought we were all going to die. I remember once they came very near because there was a lady lying about two meters from us. I could hear them walking. They had a conversation and at that point they actually called out: 'Mama, mama.' I didn't know if they were talking to me but I knew I was not going to raise my head. 'Mama, Mama' - I could hear this lady answering and less than five seconds later, two shots and then she was quiet. We lay there and she kept on groaning: 'I'm dying, I'm dying' and we were helpless, we couldn't do anything. 'We couldn't even look at her. At that point terror just gripped me because I knew I was next. It really was a miracle. I cannot explain how they could not see us and we were lying so close to her. We were terrified in there. After a while I felt someone touching my hand and I said: 'My goodness, they have found us out.' This person again came out calling: 'Mama, mama, mama, are you OK?' This was the point where I just played dead. 'Mama, mama, are you OK?' No response from me. Then I could hear this person moving. And then he came to the front. 'Mama, mama,' again and then I could feel him touching my son because I was lying over him. [Then he was] touching my daughter and... my daughter was very trusting. She raised her head and then she asked the guy: 'Who are you?' Then he said: 'I'm with the police.' At that point I raised my head and I looked at him. At first I was sceptical because he was wearing a civilian jacket but then he showed me his uniform. He said: 'I'm with the police and you are safe. We are here to help you.' And my daughter asked: 'How do I know you are not with the bad guys?' He asked us to look up and that's when we looked up and saw that there were police officers. Now I could clearly see different people in uniform. They were there with guns pointing in different directions and I knew now the police were here. That's the point when he asked us to get up. This police officer was very kind. He even reminded me to pick up my keys. He grabbed my son. My daughter ran ahead.

The leader Tim Farron did make one nod to post-election politics in Cardiff Bay during his speech, when he accused Plaid of always being willing to prop up a Labour administration whenever it got into trouble. This is potentially difficult territory, as the party has been in coalition with Labour in the past, and has struck three out of the past four budget deals allowing the Labour Welsh government to get its financial arrangements through without an overall majority. In fact, the deals of recent years which Kirsty Williams has struck with Carwyn Jones will form a central part of the Lib Dem campaign, as they look to defend the money (Â£100m a year) which they have secured for the pupil deprivation grant. One question is how the party squares the willingness to help Labour survive in government with ripping into the Welsh government at conference time? In other words, does the anti-Labour rhetoric reflect the reality of what the Lib Dem group has done during most years of the past administration? The Lib Dems say they've secured valuable concessions that are important to them. The flip side of the argument is that if Labour are as bad as the Lib Dems say they have been in government, why has it, in effect, supported them? Behind the scenes, Labour have been pleasantly surprised by how relatively easy it has been to get their budgets passed every year. There has not been blood on the carpet every time a budget has been voted on and, as a result, you could argue that this has been a group of opposition parties that has not made life that difficult for the government. On the big picture challenge for the Lib Dems, the party will need to call on their resilience which has seen them survive crises in the past. But they haven't faced a combination of threats like these in recent years with the rise of UKIP, together with a near wipe-out at a parliamentary level. One insider at the assembly unkindly referred to the prospect of Kirsty Williams being a sole-trader after the assembly elections, with the other list members not making it through. This is why the Lib Dems know they're in the fight of their lives, and why they need to squeeze everything out of their achievements in recent years. And even that might not be enough.", "question": "Can the Welsh Liberal Democrats stop @placeholder repeating itself ?", "option_0": "struggling", "option_1": "neighbouring", "option_2": "history", "option_3": "tackling", "option_4": "deepening", "label": 2}

{"article": "The photo was released by his press officer Don Wanyama who said on Facebook that his 71-year-old boss had stopped his motorcade to make the 30-minute call while returning from World Population Day celebrations in remote western Uganda on Monday. He does not say why the call had to be made from a roadside chair - with an accompanying desk - but Ugandans have offered their own explanations on Twitter. Others wondered who was on the other end of the line - his wife Janet  or another long-serving ruler, Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe? @Samzen thinks the conversation was with someone in his government, and it revolved around opposition leader Kizza Besigye who was charged with treason after denouncing Mr Museveni's victory in elections in February as fraudulent. For others, Mr Museveni was trying to identify the culprit complaining about un-tarred and potholed roads. Perhaps, though, the call was not all that important as the president had time to wave at a passing motorist. And as he said in a Facebook post, he had a \"brief chat\" with the residents of Kyeirumba Village during the stopover. \"They thanked the government for tarmacking the road that connects Uganda to Tanzania through Isingiro,\" Mr Museveni said. \"The residents also asked that government engages solar panel distributors to reduce cost. We shall follow up on this,\" he added. On Twitter, @chrisatuk pictured Mr Museveni in better company, with men who use straws to drink a home-made brew, which has water mixed into it, from a communal pot. He mocks the president for pronouncing the letter l as r, and plays on the fact that when men intend to go and drink they say: \"I am going to telephone.\" For another tweeter, the Ugandan leader was in a far more exotic place.

{"article": "As the Scottish Football Association's performance director Malky Mackay has held a series of presentations to member clubs about the proposal, the reaction has been generally positive, even from outfits that had previously been sceptical or resistant. There would be few grimaces to the notion of restoring a form of reserve team football, though, when almost everybody involved in Scottish football points to the loss of that level of the game being critical to youth academy graduates not being mentally or physically battle-hardened enough for first-team football. Consensus is the prize for Mackay, since it will enable him to deliver the project in a viable form that the clubs buy into, and the sense is that the momentum is behind him. \"Ninety-five percent of what has been said, people agree with,\" he said on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. Mackay has held three presentations this week, with a fourth to follow. He has put detail on to the outlines that were aired when points from a draft copy of Project Brave were published in the media. The difference between the youth development plan that Mackay has been appointed to oversee and the one that predecessor Mark Wotte established six years ago is that the clubs have been directly involved in producing the blueprint. Mackay is clear that communication is vital - he has visited 10 clubs since officially starting his role three weeks ago and will make his way around all 42 directly. For Project Brave to succeed, clubs need to buy into it and implement it. \"People have in the main agreed that something radical needs to be done,\" Mackay said. \"And this is radical.\" Media playback is not supported on this device What the clubs are agreeing with is the establishment of a reserve league and an under-18 league, encouraging more development loans, a summer calendar for academy football (with indoor futsal taking place in the winter) and coach development, with a head of coaching to be appointed to lead the development of the best coaches at each club. \"This whole programme is based on coaches,\" Mackay explained. \"Our coach education programme is second to none. What we're not good at is coach mentoring. \"I'm going to ask the clubs to give me their best young coach and I'll put on a course for them, we'll set them tasks, have them for a year thinking deeply about certain problems, make our good young coaches very good young coaches. \"Clubs want that to happen and we need to for our next Scotland managers. Everybody we've spoken to is up for this. We need to make the [coaches] better to make our players better. \"The part that comes up is money, funding.\" Some clubs were initially wary of the prospect of the academy system being streamlined. The plan is to reduce the number of funded elite academies from 29 to a maximum of 16. Clubs will need to submit a three-year business plan to show that their academy is financially viable, has enough support staff and coaches and good enough facilities. Academies will also be judged on measurable performance outcomes, including the number of graduates in the first team, the number actively out on loan at other clubs and the number representing the national team. All of this will be assessed by an independent company and the selected elite academies will receive funding but also play each other in a competitive league to maintain the best v best strategy. Other clubs will still be able to run academies or community outreach schemes. All will continue to receive their current level of funding for three years after Project Brave is implemented, a commitment that has won a lot of support for the plan. \"There is a soft landing for clubs, there is a lot of support and help going to be given,\" Mackay said. \"We are setting the bar high because it has to be the elite players we're focusing on. It's the 19-21 age group where the whole thing breaks down and we need to get them into first teams. \"It's up to us to educate 11-16-year-olds. We need to be better athletes and have them running properly at that age, proper sports science, diet and nutrition advice, to be under 10% body fat and sports psychology to make sure they are mentally stronger. We need to build better footballers.\" Talent identification will be a key factor, particularly when clubs will have to reduce the number of players in their academy. Mackay will establish a talent identification programme at the SFA to assist clubs in predicting which players will make the grade at 19 by measuring and assessing physical and mental markers as they develop. \"It's imperative for Scottish football,\" he said. Once Mackay has completed his presentations the next stage of the process is for Project Brave to be presented to the SFA board. Following that, and once the clubs have signed off on it, the plans will begin to be implemented in time for season 2017-18. \"It's about what is the best for the young Scottish elite player,\" Mackay added. Mackay has begun the process of making the case for Project Brave, and so far he has been encouraged by the reaction.

{"article": "The rally followed sharp rises in European markets, which came after France and Germany proposed a fiscal union ahead of a summit on 9 December. A union would mean binding limits on eurozone government borrowing. Markets hope that the agreement will open the way for the European Central Bank to bail out Italy and Spain. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index rose 2.6% to 11,523.01 points, while the broader S&P 500 index rose 2.9% to 1,192.57 points. US markets were also helped by data suggesting that recent consumer spending has been strong. The US National Retail Federation said sales during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend climbed 16% to a record $52.4bn. In Europe, the FTSE closed up 2.8%, Germany's Dax was 4.6% higher and France's Cac added 5.4%, led by banks and other financial stocks. These gains followed strong rises in Asian markets overnight. The stock market rally came despite ratings agency Moody's warning that the eurozone crisis threatens the credit rating of all the bloc's members. Moody's said the eurozone could still face a number of shocks as countries struggled with high debt levels, denying them access to markets and requiring further bailouts. \"This would very likely cause those countries' ratings to be moved into speculative [junk] grade in view of the solvency tests that would likely be required and the burden-sharing that might be imposed if, as is likely, support were to be needed for a sustained period,\" Moody's said in its report. On plans for fiscal union, the German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said his government was working closely with the French on the proposal. \"We are working intensively for the creation of a stability union,\" he said in a statement. \"That is what we want to secure through treaty changes, in which we propose that the budgets of member states must observe debt limits.\" The minister acknowledged on Sunday that it may not be possible to get necessary treaty changes agreed by all 27 European Union members states. In the UK, Conservative backbench MPs in the coalition government have been demanding a referendum on the UK's EU membership as a condition of ratifying any new treaty, while Prime Minister David Cameron has said he will use it as an opportunity to demand new policy opt-outs from Brussels. There has been speculation that the 17 eurozone governments may go it alone - passing separate bilateral agreements on the new fiscal rules, thereby avoiding the need for EU treaty changes, and circumventing a UK veto. The unprecedented move comes as many eurozone governments, including Italy and Spain, have faced sharply rising borrowing costs in nervous financial markets. \"We are in an economic war with a number of powerful speculators who have decided that the end of the euro is in their interest,\" claimed the French Agriculture Minister Brun Le Maire on Monday. By Robert PestonBusiness editor, BBC News The price for the Italian government of borrowing remains prohibitively high. Which implies that even if the Italian government isn't talking to the IMF about financial support, it may only be a matter of time. Are markets betting on IMF bailout of Italy? Italy sold 567m euros of 12-year bonds at an auction on Monday, with borrowing rates rising to 7.2%, compared with the 4.5% rate at the last equivalent auction. On Tuesday, Italy will auction 8bn euros of debt, including 10-year-bonds. However, the country's implied 10-year cost of borrowing, based on bond market prices, fell modestly on Monday, from 7.26% to 7.14% by mid-afternoon, in line with the positive sentiment on stock markets. However, a level above 7% is widely considered unsustainable for Italy in the long-run. Also on Monday, Belgium sold 2bn euros of government debt at auction, paying a yield of 5.7% on its 10-year bonds compared with 4.37% at an auction in October. Last Tuesday, Belgium saw its credit rating downgraded by ratings agency Standard and Poor's. Bond auctions are watched carefully by investors for signs that markets may be losing confidence in the ability of governments to fund their borrowing. Over the weekend, the German newspaper Die Welt reported that a subset of eurozone countries with the highest credit ratings, including France and Germany, may seek to issue debt jointly. However, the plans were denied by the German government on Monday. \"There are no plans for 'Triple-A' bonds or 'Elite bonds' as the article says,\" said the German finance ministry. On Monday, President Barack Obama warned that failure of the eurozone to tackle the crisis could damage the US economy. Speaking after meeting European Union officials, he said: \"If Europe is contracting, or if Europe is having difficulties, then it's much more difficult for us to create good jobs here at home.\" Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) denied claims that it was in bailout talks with Italy's government. Italy's La Stampa newspaper had said over the weekend that the IMF was preparing a 600bn euros ($794bn; Â£515bn) loan. However, an IMF spokesman said: \"There are no discussions with the Italian authorities on a programme for IMF financing.\" Italy has come under intense scrutiny from the markets in recent weeks. The fear is that, given its enormous debt levels and slow rate of growth, the country may find it tough to pay back its debt and to raise further cash. An IMF team is expected in Rome shortly to monitor the progress of the new government in cutting the deficit. The technocratic government of Prime Minister Mario Monti is expected to announce new measures early next month. The Italian government's debt stands at 118% of the gross domestic product (GDP). To make matters worse, its annual economic growth rate over the past 15 years has been just 0.75%, and the country is now forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to be entering recession.", "question": "Wall Street rebounded from seven days of losses on hopes that eurozone leaders will stitch together a new @placeholder to help the bloc 's ailing economies .", "option_0": "organisation", "option_1": "bid", "option_2": "deal", "option_3": "era", "option_4": "requirement", "label": 2}

The city is soon to become the home of Tech North, a government-backed organisation that will promote the interests of start-ups in cities in the north of England, similar to the Tech City initiative in London. The BBC understands the headquarters of Tech North will be located in Manchester's trendy Northern Quarter, an area not unlike Old Street, the part of London home to many of the city's up-and-coming small tech firms. On Thursday, a government-backed report examined the growth of technology \"clusters\" around the UK. It suggested that as well as London - where the government has put considerable effort into promoting start-ups - other places such as Brighton, Liverpool, Belfast and Greater Manchester have shown strong growth in the digital industry. The Tech Britain report findings have been published online as an interactive guide. Prime Minister David Cameron said: \"The digital economy has become an integral part of our country and the rapid growth of many digital businesses has confirmed Britain's position as a global hub of technology excellence.\" Chancellor George Osborne added: \"What's so exciting about today's Tech Nation report is that it shows how we're seeing the growth of tech businesses right across the country. \"As part of our plan for a truly national recovery we will do everything we can to support this growth and back the different tech clusters that are emerging around Britain.\" The imminent arrival of Tech North in Manchester comes five years after Mr Cameron announced Tech City, an organisation set up to support start-ups around the so-called \"Silicon Roundabout\" in East London. Since then, the government has been eager to stress its success - however there are some in the technology business who dispute the impact Tech City has had, arguing that start-ups were succeeding independently of any government help.

{"article": "In conditions more akin to Nagpur than Nottingham, India opener Vijay batted throughout the day to score an accomplished unbeaten 122, and captain Mahendra Dhoni was 50 not out in an unbroken partnership of 81. But England's quartet of seamers never lost heart, responding well to a difficult morning as skipper Alastair Cook was rewarded for attacking field placings with quick wickets after lunch and tea. Stuart Broad was the pick of the bowlers with 1-26 off 19 overs at his home ground, while there were two wickets for James Anderson and one for Liam Plunkett. Ben Stokes, recalled in place of Chris Jordan, bowled 19 economical overs. Anderson agreed that England were \"amazing hosts\" when asked if they were failing to make the most of home advantage. \"We're probably as frustrated as everyone else is watching,\" he said. \"We had a good day, all in all - we toiled away on a really placid pitch.\" However, the absence of frontline spinner was exposed as Moeen Ali conceded 50 off nine overs and was dismissively crashed for a straight six by Vijay in the final hour of the day. Moeen was one of four players with fewer than five Test caps in an England side desperately seeking to end a run of eight Tests without a victory. \"The Trent Bridge deck was so unresponsive that some balls were bouncing twice before reaching the wicketkeeper. To see that on the first day of a Test match is utterly demoralising.\" Jonathan Agnew on England v India India are also a team in transition. Since their 4-0 defeat by England in 2011, star batsmen Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman have all retired, leaving six of their top seven playing their first Test on English soil. The unfamiliar surroundings did not unnerve Vijay, who got off to a flyer with three fours in the first over of the day before settling down to anchor the innings. He spent 13 balls on 99 before bringing up his fourth Test century off 214 balls with a flick to square leg. The morning had belonged entirely to India as they scored 106 runs for the loss of one wicket, that of Shikhar Dhawan, superbly caught one-handed by wicketkeeper Matt Prior off Anderson. The pitch was so benign that by the end of the session Broad was bowling with only a single slip in place. England's day was revived by an inspired field placing by under-pressure captain Cook. Clearly bowling to a plan in the second over after lunch, Anderson held back some pace and drew a mistimed drive from Cheteshwar Pujara which was athletically taken by Ian Bell at silly mid-on. With a Test average of 50.36 at number four, the stylish Virat Kohli has been talked about as the natural heir to Tendulkar. But his first Test innings in England lasted only eight balls as he edged Broad to Bell at second slip. Rattled by the sudden momentum shift and the extra step in the stride of England's seamers, India knuckled down and barely scored a run for the next hour. They successfully took the sting out of England's attack and began scoring more freely later in the session before taking tea on 177-3. Cook brought himself in at silly point after tea and once again the change of tactic paid instant dividends as Ajinkya Rahane toe-ended a pull off Plunkett straight to the skipper. Anderson described Cook's performance as \"brilliant\", adding: \"He worked really well with the bowlers. We had a lot of discussions about field placings. We had to get a bit funky at times.\" However, England's pursuit of further wickets was thwarted by Vijay and Dhoni. Dhoni, who is yet to score a Test hundred outside Asia, was characteristically positive as he brought up his 30th Test fifty from 64 deliveries in the final over of the day.

Monroe, born Norma Jean Mortenson on 1 June 1926, became one of history's most enduring stars but died from an overdose at 36. The Happy Birthday Miss Monroe collection runs from 2-30 June in London. It is being presented by online gallery ONGallery and the Playboy Club London at the Showroom Presents. The prints range from those taken in 1946,  when Monroe was still known as Norma Jean Baker in her hometown of Los Angeles, to those entitled the The Last Sitting. The Last Sitting images were taken by photographer Bert Stern not long before Monroe's death on 5 August, 1962. Stern took around 2,500 photos of Monroe for fashion magazine Vogue over a three-day period. His resulting book of the shoot was published in 1982 and again in 2000.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device One goal was enough, a superb second half strike from Kris Doolan. The Tannadice club were made to regret missing a glut of first half chances. Thistle had luck on their side, but an improved second half showing brought them three vital points and to within touching distance of the top six. The result leaves Mixu Paatelainen's men bottom, five points behind Kilmarnock with just six games left. It was the Tayside club who responded to a vociferous travelling support of 1,909 in a crowd of 4,533. Ryan Dow had a shot held by Tomas Cerny, and then a great free kick from Paul Paton curled into a dangerous area but could not be cashed in by the United players in the six yard box. Dow had about four chances in the opening spell, the best of which was a four on three break in which Guy Demel played him in, but he shot over. Billy McKay was next to nearly take advantage of some comic cuts Thistle defending with a lob just over the bar, swiftly followed John Rankin having a go but being denied by a fabolous save from Cerny. Rankin went close again with a sizzling 25 yarder just past the post. At this stage it was King Canute versus the tide. Against all this, just before half-time Partick should have had a penalty when Gavin Gunning clearly had a grip of Doolan, but referee Andrew Dallas waved play on. It would have been astonishing had Thistle gone in ahead. It was a miracle that the half finished 0-0. The injury gods continued to conspire against Thistle right at the start of the second half. Frederic Frans went down with no-one near him and limped off to be replaced by Mustapha Dumbuya, with the home side having already lost Gary Fraser in the first half. But that tide was turning. There was one fabulous move which ended with Callum Booth volleying just over the bar and there was a new pace and appetite about the home side. One way or another a goal had to come. And so it did. For Thistle. Doolan scored his ninth of the season with a magnificent drive from the edge of the box after a sweet build up.

Yahya Abdi survived lack of oxygen and freezing temperatures on a five-hour flight from California to Hawaii. Ms Abdullahi said that both her brother and father who live in Europe had phoned to tell her about her son Yahya's lucky escape. \"My father watched the news from the TV and saw the pictures of my son, and then he called me and told me that he had seen my son on news channels,\" she told the BBC Somali service. \"Thank God, now he is safe and in a good condition.\" Talking on the phone from a refugee camp in Sheed Dheer where she has lived since 2008, Ms Abdullahi said she was shocked that her son could have put himself in such danger. BBC Somali's Abdifitah Ibrahim Cagayare says in the middle of the interview Ms Abdullahi broke down and sobbed uncontrollably. She said that since her two sons and daughter went to the US in 2008 with her ex-husband she had been desperately trying to get in touch with them. \"We are divorcedâ€¦ I called him [her ex-husband] several times through his relatives and he refused to talk to me,\" she said. \"I want to hear the voice of my children, I want to see them, please help me and guide me to that, please,\" the mother wept.

The strike, which ran from 5 March 1984 to 3 March 1985, saw tens of thousands of miners walk out in protest at plans to close scores of pits. A museum spokesperson said the exhibition was intended to \"celebrate miners globally\". Gwendolen Whitaker from the museum said the exhibition was \"a powerful insight into the real lives of mining communities\". The exhibition will also screen Ms Vanson's film The Battle for Orgreave. On 18 June 1984, British Steel's coking plant at Orgreave, South Yorkshire, saw some of the worst violence. About 10,000 striking miners clashed with 5,000 police officers, which led to 93 picketers being arrested with 51 picketers and 72 police officers injured, according to South Yorkshire Police. In 1984 there were 170 working collieries in Britain, employing about 190,000 people. Now just three deep mines remain, employing about 2,000 people Two of those mines, Kellingley in Yorkshire and Thoresby in Nottinghamshire, are due to close, leaving just the employee-owned Hatfield Colliery in South Yorkshire. The National Coal Mining Museum is at Caphouse Colliery, where shafts to work coal date from at least 1789. By 1985 the colliery's coal was exhausted.

{"article": "Beijing officials said a crisis management mechanism had been set up to prevent the situation from worsening. The strategically important islands, known as Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan, are controlled by Japan. Meanwhile Japanese PM Shinzo Abe said the ground was being laid for a bilateral meeting between him and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week. \"Both Japan and China are coming to the view that it would benefit not just the two countries but regional stability if a summit is held,\" he said, quoted by Reuters news agency. The meeting is expected to take place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday. If it happens it will be the first proper exchange between the two leaders since they came to power, in 2012 and 2013 respectively. The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement that senior Chinese and Japanese officials had reached a four-point agreement, which included a recognition of their \"different positions\" over the islands. They had agreed \"to prevent the situation from aggravating through dialogue and consultation and establish crisis management mechanisms to avoid contingencies,\" the statement added. However, Reuters later quoted Mr Abe as saying that Japan's position on the islands was unchanged. The dispute over the islands has become particularly acrimonious over the last two years. The BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing says it has inflamed nationalistic sentiment in both countries and damaged economic ties. The islands are close to important shipping lanes, offer rich fishing grounds and lie near potential oil and gas reserves. In 2012 Japan moved to purchase the islands from their private owners, sparking violent anti-Japanese protests in China. In November 2013, China announced the creation of a new air defence identification zone, which would require any aircraft in the zone - which covers the islands - to comply with rules laid down by Beijing. Japan labelled the move a \"unilateral escalation\" and said it would ignore it. The two countries also differ over Japan's actions in China during World War II.

{"article": "Poehler, the Golden Globe winner of NBC TV series Parks and Recreation, is the voice of Joy, Riley's first emotion, who arrives as soon as she is born. But the central message of the film, according to the actress, is that it's OK to be sad. \"Joy has been in charge for 11 years and is pretty comfortable being in the driving seat and assumes she's going to be there forever,\" she says, \"and we find out very quickly that Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust - the other emotions - want a turn at the wheel.\" Poehler adds: \"I love the message of the film which is basically that no-one can be happy all the time - and that's OK. In fact, sadness may get you where you need to be. \"It's a very revolutionary idea, especially for parents who are constantly obsessed with their children's happiness, and in doing so don't often allow them to be in the moment and feel their feelings, and it's a great thing for children to understand, too.\" When Riley's family move from Minnesota to San Francisco, the trauma pitches Joy and Sadness out of headquarters, leaving Anger, Disgust and Fear in charge. Or, in other words, according to director Pete Docter, Riley starts becoming a teenager. Docter, a father of two, wrote and directed Pixar's double Oscar-winning film Up, as well as Monsters Inc, and named the young heroine of Up after his daughter Ellie, who also voiced the part. \"My daughter was very like the Ellie of Up - spirited and sparky,\" he explains. \"But then as time went on, she became quieter and more withdrawn. It was really hard to know what she was thinking as she started to grow up.\" Producer Jonas Rivera adds: \"Inside Out is our attempt to answer Pete's question of 'What's going on inside my daughter's head?' \"We didn't know either. I think a lot of parents ask that question.\" Each emotion is given a distinct colour and shape, from the green of Disgust - a homage to Riley's hatred of broccoli - to the red block of Anger, who emits fire when disturbed. This, according to Poehler, who runs an online community for girls and women called Smart Girls, could be a step forward for children trying to articulate their emotions. She says that, as the mother of two boys, she knows how hard it is for children to say what they feel.  \"What [the film] does is give you the tools to talk about emotions and feelings which isn't very easy to do all of the time.\" It would be satisfying, she says, to hear a child say, \"I feel like Anger today\" because he or she can visualise it. However, Docter denies that Inside Out is Pixar \"doing\" psychotherapy for children - or for adults, who, he believes, could benefit just as much from the film. \"So many adults employ therapists because they can't express themselves,\" he points out. \"As a kid, at least if you are angry you lie on the floor and kick and scream, but as we grow up we realise it's not socially acceptable to do that and sometimes we bottle things up. \"The theme of the film is that our emotions bring us together - storing things up and claiming to be happy all the time doesn't actually connect you with people on a deeper level.\" But does the film accurately reflect primary human emotions? Psychotherapist Dr Dacher Keltner, from the University of California, who was a consultant on the film, says what it gets right is the idea that emotions oscillate. \"There will be a time when your mind is filled with fear - a second or two before shifting to anger. The movie portrays that struggle over the control panel that I feel to be true scientifically.\" And so far, Pixar's foray into psychology is winning audience hearts as well as their minds - not to mention their wallets. Since its US debut a month ago, Inside Out is nudging the half-billion dollar mark (Â£320m) at the box office, putting it on track to become the most successful Pixar movie. The Independent called it \"an instant classic\" while the Radio Times noted that \"Pixar... never fails to locate the sweet spot between stylish smartness and tear-jerking goofiness\". But Docter thinks that the real success of Inside Out can't be measured financially. \"It's a first for children at a pivotal age, and it's about someone relatable, not a superhero or fairytale characters. \"A movie that can tell little girls that it's hard to grow up and it's OK to be sad about it is actually profound.\" Inside Out is released in the UK on 24 July", "question": "It 's the final frontier , according to actress Amy Poehler - but the @placeholder in Pixar 's latest animation , Inside Out , does n't take place in space , but in the caverns of the human brain , as the emotions of an 11 - year - old girl , Riley , go on an adventure inside her head .", "option_0": "occasion", "option_1": "event", "option_2": "contests", "option_3": "action", "option_4": "deadness", "label": 3}

Everyone at the Ihura stadium in central Kenya calls her cucu - meaning grandmother in her native Kikuyu language. The 56-year-old is one of just five women at the stadium being treated for alcoholism. A recent crackdown in Kenya on illegally brewed beer and unlicensed drinking dens is one part of a policy to deal with alcoholism in the country, another part is the rehabilitation of addicts. \"Last year, I saw people go blind and die right in front of me after we drank some local brew,\" Ms Wanjiku says. \"I was lucky, I only lost vision in one of my eyes,\" she laughs pointing to her blind left eye. But she continued to drink. \"I have been drinking the hard stuff for the past 30 years.  At some point some of my children stopped going to school because I used all my money on drinking. Any cent I got would end up at the drinking den,\" says the mother of seven. She was able to buy a 750 millilitre bottle of the brew for just $1 (Â£0.60). In the three weeks since the tents were erected in the stadium and the rehabilitation centre opened, the number of people seeking help here has risen to 700. Everyone who comes gets a place in a bunk bed under a marquee tent, three meals a day, counselling and a medical check-up - but they have to stay for three months. The authorities believe the figure could swell to 5,000 and are already putting up extra tents to accommodate more people. But there is one large space left in the middle of the pitch, where patients can play football, bask in the sun and gather for their morning assembly. I met policemen, teachers, lawyers and a surgeon who are all receiving counselling. \"We can construct all the roads we want here, but if we don't have people to walk on those roads, if our children are not here any more because of alcohol, what is the use of those roads?\" asks county governor Mwangi wa Iria. \"We are putting everything else on hold until we sort out this problem. It doesn't matter how much money we use,\" he says. The mother of 33-year-old David Kamau persuaded him to come here for help, and at the entrance security officers confiscate cigarettes, marijuana and tobacco, which they find in his luggage. \"The only reason I am here is my two children and my young wife,\" Mr Kamau says. \"They might leave me if I do not reform, change my ways, you know. So I have to give it a try.\" He says his addiction began as a teenager, but lately he has been drinking more heavily, and smoking marijuana. Pointing to a scar on his face he says: \"People say I have become very violent to everyone when I am drunk.\" There is also a brick wall surrounding the stadium which is low enough to see the nearby town of Muranga. One man told me that he misses home but \"all I need to do everyday is go to the wall and peep over it. I see the roof of my house and I am satisfied. But I am not going home until I finish this programme and go back to being sober.\" Governor wa Iria says that all the young men have been encouraged to form peer support groups to help each other stay sober once they get out. They are also getting vocational and life skills training. \"Everyone you see here will join a cooperative society that will venture into agriculture, and especially the dairy sector. We have clearly thought about this and we have to save our children,\" the governor says.

He was a lobster fisherman by trade and a founder of the whale rescue group on Campobello Island, New Brunswick. Friends told the Canadian Press he had saved some two dozen whales over 15 years. Mackie Green, a friend of Mr Howlett who had founded the rescue team with him, said: \"They got the whale totally disentangled and then some kind of freak thing happened and the whale made a big flip.\" \"Joe definitely would not want us to stop because of this,\" he added. \"This is something he loved and there's no better feeling than getting a whale untangled, and I know how good he was feeling after cutting that whale clear.\" The animal was a North Atlantic right whale - an endangered species that may grow to about 15m (50 feet) in length and weigh up to 70 tonnes.

Seven were found dead in Canada's Gulf of St Laurence in the last month - a significant blow to the global population. Mr Howlett was on board a government response vessel at the time of his death.

{"article": "In 1913, Sir Edward Carson formed the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) to oppose a Dublin parliament, by force if necessary. Irish nationalists, incensed at any attempt \"to mutilate the nation\", formed the much larger Irish Volunteers. Up to 170,000 strong, the new force was determined to \"defend Ireland's rights\". As both forces acquired arms from Imperial Germany, Ireland seemed on the brink of civil war. But the sudden outbreak of World War One on 3 August 1914 put the 'Irish Question' on hold as John Redmond and Carson pledged their rival armies to the British war effort. Redmond, flushed by his success in having the third Home Rule Act placed on the statute book  - it was suspended for the duration of the war - urged Irish nationalists \"to go wherever the firing-line extended\". Moved by the fate of \"gallant little Belgium\" and the need for Irishmen to win British goodwill for all-Ireland Home Rule, the nationalist leader told volunteers at Woodenbridge, County Wicklow, on 18 September 1914: \"This war is undertaken in the defence of the highest principles of religion, morality and right…\" Redmond's hopes of a distinctively 'Irish brigade', based on the National Volunteers, met with rank hostility from the pro-unionist Kitchener and the War Office. While the UVF were effectively absorbed into the Ulster Division, the British military élite was  determined to prevent the creation of an Irish army. By the end of 1915, the 16th Irish had joined the Ulstermen in France. Although the tragedy of the Somme is forever linked to the blood-sacrifice of 'Carson's Army', the 16th (Irish) Division also took part in that horrific battle. The 1st battalion of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers were cut to pieces by machine-gun fire as they tried to take the German stronghold of Beaumont Hamel on 1 July. It was later to fall to the 10th Dublin Fusiliers. The 16th Irish made their greatest impact in the later stages of the battle at Guillemont and Ginchy on 6 and 9 September 1916. Responsibility for attacking the German stronghold of Guillemont fell to the 7th Leinsters and 6th Connaught Rangers (which included 600 nationalists from west Belfast). As they made their way through the aptly-named 'Death Valley', the Connaughts, led by Lt JFB O'Sullivan, caught the Germans by surprise . It was, an observer wrote, \"one of the most astonishing features of war… a wild and irresistible assault\". Redmond's army had won its first battle honour as well as its first VC, awarded to Pte Thomas Hughes of County Monaghan who, despite being wounded, had taken out a machine-gun post. But the victory was a costly one: almost half the 2,400 Irish troops involved were killed. After Guillemont, the focus shifted to the nearby village of Ginchy. General Haig felt its capture was essential to any allied breakthrough. To catch the German defenders by surprise the attack was planned for 16:45 local time on 9 September 1916 following a ten-hour artillery barrage. The 16th's assault was led by the 6th Royal Irish Regiment and the 8th Munsters who advanced in four waves, followed by the Connaughts and 7th Leinsters. Many of the British shells had fallen short of the German lines. No sooner had the Irishmen left their trenches than they were cut down by remorseless machine-gun fire - \"a hurricane of steel and lead\". Some 450 of the 1,000 assault troops were killed or wounded. Among the dead was the poet and former Home Rule MP, Professor Tom Kettle, 36, killed when leading his men into Ginchy village. Kettle, who had experienced the Easter Rising at home, predicted that the executed rebel leaders would \"go down as heroes and martyrs\" while he would go down - if at all - as \"a bloody British officer\". Like Redmond, he expressed the hope that the shared experience of Irishmen from north and south in the war might lead to \"the reconciliation of Protestant Ulster with Ireland and... of Ireland with Great Britain\". Kettle refused to leave the appalling trench conditions for a safer posting. \"I have chosen to stay with my comrades,\" he confided to his brother. \"I am calm and happy and desperately anxious to live.\" He was not hopeful, however. In a poignant sonnet to his infant daughter on the eve of his death, the young nationalist officer foresaw that his involvement in \"England's War\" might be misunderstood: \"So here, while the mad guns curse overhead, \"And tired men sigh, with mud for couch and floor, \"Know that we fools, now with the foolish dead, died not for flag, nor king, nor emperor, \"But for a dream, born in a herdsman's shed, \"And for the secret scripture of the poor.\" Nine months later in June 1917, Irishmen from north and south would fight alongside each other for the first time in the Battle of Messines in Belgium. Demobbed in 1919, the survivors of Redmond's \"Irish Brigade\" would return to an island transformed by the impact of the 1916 Rising. Nationalist veterans would find themselves ignored, marginalised and \"airbrushed out of history\" after the War of Independence in the south. Their world had changed forever.

Cobalt is a a vital component of lithium-ion batteries. The firms said that they had a zero tolerance policy towards child labour. The DRC produces at least 50% of the world's cobalt. Miners working in the area face long-term health problems and the risk of fatal accidents, according to Amnesty. It claimed that at least 80 miners had died underground in southern DRC between September 2014 and December 2015. It also collected the testimonies of children who allegedly work in the mines. Paul, a 14-year-old orphan, started mining when he was 12 and told researchers:  \"I would spend 24 hours down in the tunnels. I arrived in the morning and would leave the following morning ... I had to relieve myself down in the tunnels â€¦ My foster mother planned to send me to school, but my foster father was against it, he exploited me by making me work in the mine.\" UNICEF estimates that there are approximately 40,000 children working in mines across southern DRC. In response to the report, Apple said: \"Underage labour is never tolerated in our supply chain and we are proud to have led the industry in pioneering new safeguards.\" It said that it conducts rigorous audits on its supply chain and any supplier found hiring underage workers is forced to: On cobalt specifically it added: \"We are currently evaluating dozens of different materials, including cobalt, in order to identify labour and environmental risks as well as opportunities for Apple to bring about effective, scalable and sustainable change.\" Samsung said that it had a \"zero tolerance policy\" towards child labour and that, it too, conducted regular and rigorous audits of its supply chain. \"If a violation of child labour is found, contracts with suppliers who use child labour will be immediately terminated,\" it said. Sony commented: \"We are working with the suppliers to address issues related to human rights and labour conditions at the production sites, as well as in the procurement of minerals and other raw materials.\" The Amnesty report, which was jointly researched with African Resources Watch (Afrewatch), traced how traders buy cobalt from areas where child labour is rife, selling it on to firm Congo Dongfang Mining (CDM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chinese mineral giant Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Ltd. Amnesty contacted 16 multinationals who were listed as customers of the battery manufacturers, who in turn source minerals from Huayou Cobalt. One company admitted the connection while four others were unable to say for certain the source of the cobalt they used. Five denied sourcing the mineral from the firm, despite being listed as customers in company documents and two others said that they did not source cobalt from DRC. Six firms said that they were investigating the claims. \"It is a major paradox of the digital era that some of the world's richest, most innovative companies are able to market incredibly sophisticated devices without being required to show where they source raw materials for their components,\" said executive director of Afrewatch (Africa Resources Watch)  Emmanuel Umpula. \"The abuses in mines remain out of sight and out of mind because in today's global marketplace, consumers have no idea about the conditions at the mine, factory and assembly line. We found that traders are buying cobalt without asking questions about how and where it was mined.\" Mark Dummett, business and human rights researcher at Amnesty said that mining was \"one of the worst forms of child labour\". \"The glamorous shop displays and marketing of state of the art technologies are a stark contrast to the children carrying bags of rocks and miners in narrow man-made tunnels risking permanent lung damage,\" he said. \"Millions of people enjoy the benefits of new technologies but rarely ask how they are made. It is high time the big brands took some responsibility for the mining of the raw materials that make their lucrative products. \"Companies whose global profits total $125bn (Â£86.7bn) cannot credibly claim that they are unable to check where key minerals in their productions come from,\"  he said.

She also said: \"This is a dangerous moment for our country and we share vital human rights values that need defending more than ever before in my lifetime.\" Who is Shami Chakrabarti She was the Labour leader's only nomination as part of David Cameron's resignation honours list. Ms Chakrabarti was appointed to lead an independent inquiry into claims of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party following the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone. The review found there was evidence of \"ignorant attitudes\" but said the \"Labour Party is not overrun by anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of racism\". In a statement posted on Twitter, the Chief Rabbi said: \"Shami Chakrabarti has a proud record of public service, but in accepting this peerage, the credibility of her report lies in tatters and the Labour Party's stated intention, to unequivocally tackle anti-Semitism, remains woefully unrealised.\" Wes Streeting, Labour MP for Ilford North, said: \"Shami Chakrabarti will bring great experience to Lords.

{"article": "The need was even greater following the economic uncertainty caused by the UK's vote to leave the EU, the Local Government Association (LGA) said. It estimated that at least four million people of working age in England would need affordable housing by 2024. First-time buyer numbers in England have fallen by a third in a decade. The fall in home ownership among the young and rising rental costs has led to some calls for councils to step in to increase the supply of homes with a new building programme. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: \"Local authorities have £2.5bn in housing reserves and borrowing headroom of £3.4bn, so they should be able to build the homes their communities need. \"Furthermore, we have set out the most ambitious vision for housing in a generation, including investing £8bn to build 400,000 more affordable homes.\" Between the late 1940s and late 1950s councils built more homes than the private sector. Local authorities were building 100,000 homes a year up to the late 1970s, but the election of Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979 led to a fall in housebuilding by local authorities. In the year to the end of June, local authorities built 1,500 homes in England out of a total of 131,370 - that is just over 1%. \"Bold new action is needed to solve our housing crisis following the vote to leave the European Union. A renaissance in house building by councils must be at the heart of this,\" said Peter Box, LGA housing spokesman. \"The private sector clearly has an important role to play but the reality is that it cannot build the homes we need on its own, and will likely be further restricted by uncertainties in the months and years ahead.\" The LGA is calling for the government to allow councils to: \"If we are to stand any chance of solving our housing crisis, councils must be able to replace sold homes and reinvest in building more of the genuine affordable homes our communities desperately need now more than ever,\" Mr Box said. A separate report from the Centre for Economics and Business Research suggests that \"tremors\" from the vote to leave the EU will not prevent the average UK home costing about £40,000 more in five years' time.

We can't allow the laws to allow players to hit high accidentally and for people to say 'oh, that's just rugby'.

Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy said the new laws were making referees' lives difficult. after fly-half Sam Davies was sin-binned in their Pro12 win against Connacht on Saturday. Meanwhile, Scarlets controversially beat Ulster when Sean Reidy was yellow carded for a high tackle at the try-line on Aled Davies and referee Marius Mitrea awarded the Welsh side a penalty try and just two minutes later, Scarlets second row Jake Ball was also sent to the sin bin for a high tackle.

Barrington was sent off for the tackle under the new interpretation of the laws. Jones believes that there has been a shift in the way that players tackle in the last 20 years, along with the introduction of professionalism into the sport. \"It comes down to a cultural change in the game. Since professionalism and the influence of rugby league coaches and the way offload and contact area has dominated rugby now, the tackle has risen in terms of its height,\" Jones continued. \"Perhaps the influence of the southern hemisphere and the Polynesian countries tend to tackle a bit higher in the past.

{"article": "The gunman, 25-year-old Micah Xavier Johnson, was linked to black separatist groups including the New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, the Nation of Islam and the Black Riders Liberation Party. Before Johnson was killed by a bomb detonated by a police robot, he told negotiators he wanted to kill white police officers. He also told police he acted alone and was not affiliated with any groups. However, Johnson's online presence has revealed his enthusiasm for black separatist groups. Though his affiliation with these groups is unclear, his Facebook profile photograph featured him raising a fist in salute to \"black power\", which is associated with the Black Panther Party movement, a radical political organisation that came to power in response to the 1960s US civil rights upheaval. He also joined groups online that reference the Black Panther Party, However, Johnson was reportedly \"blacklisted\" from many of the organisations that inspired him, the Daily Beast reported. While activist groups such as Black Lives Matter have taken a central role in the US movement on police reform and racial justice, black separatist groups have used a more racist and militant approach. Many black separatist \"hate groups\" are rooted in racism and anti-Semitism, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center's Heidi Beirich. Ms Beirich tells the BBC these type of hate groups are different from typical white supremacy groups like the Klu Klux Klan, in that they are formed in reaction to societal white oppression. Many of today's groups make reference to the original Black Panther Party, which carried out armed citizens' patrols to monitor police behaviour in California during the 1960s. However, none are affiliated with the Black Panthers. Though the Black Panthers promoted armed resistance early on in the movement, the group placed more emphasis on police patrols, according to Stanford Historian Clayborne Carson. \"They had decided that that kind of emphasis on the gun was counterproductive in terms of their ability to get support in the black community,\" he tells the BBC. \"In a sense the Black Panther Party police patrols were doing what video cameras do now,\" Mr Carson says. \"If they had iPhones at that time, they would have not simply watched police but also recorded them.\" The New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense (NBPP), founded in 1989 in Dallas, is one of the major black separatist groups in the US. The group has a 10-point platform advocating the power to practise self-determination for a \"black nation\", the release of all black people in prison, an end to police brutality against black people, and a call for all black people to arm themselves for self-defence. The SPLC and Anti-Defamation League have labelled the NBPP as a hate group \"whose leaders have encouraged violence against whites, Jews, and law enforcement officers\". Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale has called the NBPP's rhetoric \"xenophobic\" and \"absurd\". The Nation of Islam (NOI) was founded in 1930 and is considered the oldest black nationalist group in the US. While the group provides social service programmes to African American communities, the SLPC and Anti-Defamation League have branded it as a hate group founded in anti-Semitism and racism. The Huey P Newton Gun Club, named after one of the Black Panthers' founders, was created last year in Dallas to oppose \"police terrorism\". The group teaches self-defence and conducts patrols in areas where black men have died at the hands of police. \"Us arming ourselves, we're able to create a culture of being independent from government institutions who do not have our best interest in mind,\" said Rakem Balogun, a founding member of the gun club. \"When [white people] see us with guns, they see boys in the hood\", he told the BBC's Dan Murdoch, \"instead of thinking black deacons of defence\". Though Johnson was a member of the Huey P Newtown Gun Club's Facebook group, member Erick Khafre told the Los Angeles Times that he had no affiliation to the club \"in any way\". Ms Beirich also notes the gun club is not counted as a SPLC hate group as it does not reinforce racist ideals. In recent years, the high-profile police shootings of African Americans have fuelled the proliferation of black separatist groups, according to SPLC. In 2015, US police shot and killed a civilian nearly 1,000 times, according to a year-long Washington Post study. The deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Freddie Gray and more recently, Philando Castile and Alton Sterling are also among some of the cases that groups have used as an \"organising tool\" to illuminate the systemic problem with police racism, Ms Beirich says. In response, the number of black separatist hate groups has jumped from 113 chapters in 2014 to 180 last year, SLPC reported. Each group carries different beliefs in relation to black power and white oppression. However, many black separatist groups are explicitly anti-white and tend to share a mistrust of government, according to Ms Beirich. Some groups are also anti-Semitic and anti-gay, which could be attributed to rhetoric by the long-standing NOI. The group's leader, Louis Farrakhan, has long espoused anti-Semitism and homophobic messages. \"These false Jews promote the filth of Hollywood that is seeding the American people and the people of the world and bringing you down in moral strength. â€¦ It's the wicked Jews, the false Jews, that are promoting lesbianism, homosexuality\", Mr Farrakhan said in 2006. \"The group has left a stain on the radical black nationalist movement\", Ms Beirich says, noting that many radicals may have started as NOI members and spiralled farther into extremism. In contrast, the Black Lives Matter movement extends beyond the African American community. \"What's striking about the Black Lives Matter protest is how multi-racial they are,\" Mr Carson says. \"It's probably one of the most multi-racial activities going on in the US.\"", "question": "The Dallas gunman who shot and killed five police officers and injured seven others supported armed black militia groups , bringing to @placeholder a movement that has thrived in the wake of police shootings in recent years .", "option_0": "defuse", "option_1": "produce", "option_2": "bury", "option_3": "establish", "option_4": "light", "label": 4}

The first box was installed in the Dublin Road at the end of 2014. Since then, five more have been put in public toilets. They are in Custom House Square, Winetavern Street, Lombard Street, the Ormeau Road and the Antrim Road. When all six are rolled out, 12 of the 14 public toilets in Belfast will have sharps disposal facilities. The needle bins are small silver plaques sited on the wall with the words \"sharps disposal\" on them. There is a hole in the middle to allow people to dispose of used needles in a secure container. The issue was raised at a meeting of the People and Communities Committee in April. The council minutes said the increase in boxes was down to an increase in sharps finds. It said that the BBC had reported that the Council's \"Needle Exchange Programme\" witnessed an increase in visits in four years, from 7,500 to just under 15,000. Following this increase in sharps finds, the council \"liaised with their contracted service providers and other public bodies on an ongoing basis to take measures to counteract this behaviour\".

{"article": "The spread of non-native species threatens livelihoods and biodiversity, but the issue is worsened by global trade, travel and climate change. Writing in Nature Communications journal, and international team forecast how the spread of species could change over the 21st Century. They show that one-sixth of the world's land surface is vulnerable to invasion. In what the authors say is the first evaluation of its kind, the paper assesses individual nations' abilities to manage existing invasive species and respond to new ones. Regan Early from the University of Exeter, Jeffrey Dukes from Purdue University in the US and other co-authors suggest that developed countries, which have been most affected by invasive species - and have the strongest management efforts - will continue to face an onslaught of new arrivals. However, they predict that non-native plants, animals and microbes will increasingly threaten developing countries with some of the last remaining biodiversity hotspots, due to increased air travel and the expansion of agriculture. This could endanger livelihoods and food security in fragile economies that are ill-prepared to deal with the expansion of invasive organisms. Dr Early commented: \"Rampant globalisation will lead to invasions in countries with the least capability to deal with them. \"We need more international cooperation, and the US, Australia and nations in Europe to share expertise.\" Prof Dukes added: \"Low-income countries stand to lose a lot by having their natural resources sapped by invasive species. \"We hope this analysis can be a conversation starter for governments around the world to strengthen their protection.\" Invasive species often travel as stowaways or contaminants in goods imported by planes and ships. They also arrive as exotic pets or plants that subsequently escape or are released deliberately into the wild. This can pose challenges native species that have evolved over thousands of years to be well adapted to their ecosystems. Consequently, new arrivals can quickly change the nature of a whole region and often outcompete native organisms for resources and habitat. Burmese pythons originally arrived in the US as exotic pets, but they escaped and quickly established themselves in the Florida Everglades, where they have contributed to a catastrophic decline in native mammals. In Europe, forests and woods have been transformed by introduced diseases and pests such as Dutch elm disease and Ash dieback. \"You can think of invasive species as biological pollution - a self-replicating change,\" said Prof Dukes. \"It doesn't take much effort or intention to bring in an invasive species that then wreaks havoc on a landscape.\" Biological invasions in the developing world so far have included influxes of Diamondback moths, which can devastate broccoli, cabbage and other crops; Panama disease, which wiped out banana plantations in central and south America; and prickly pear, which devastated grassland in Africa, leading to cattle being malnourished.", "question": "Most countries in the world have little @placeholder to deal effectively with invasive species , a study suggests .", "option_0": "capacity", "option_1": "declined", "option_2": "doubled", "option_3": "halved", "option_4": "increased", "label": 0}
{"article": "The claim: Prime Minister Theresa May says there is no turning back from the triggering of Article 50, which starts the process of leaving the EU. Reality Check verdict: The government is clear that it respects the result of the referendum, so it argues that any debate is theoretical. However, the question of whether Article 50 is irrevocable is the subject of legal dispute. As a result, the UK government has been unable to make any definitive legal statements on the issue. The Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, has said \"My understanding is that it is irrevocable,\" while the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said in December 2016: \"Is it irrevocable? I don't know.\" In the recent UK Supreme Court case on Article 50, both sides assumed that it was irrevocable and the court judgement concluded: \"We are content to proceed on the basis that that is correct, without expressing any view of our own.\" So this is not an issue that has been formally tested in a UK court. But European Council President Donald Tusk has said that he believes Article 50 can be reversed. When asked if the UK could unilaterally withdraw its Article 50 notification during the next two years, he said, \"Formally, legally, yes.\" Lord Kerr - the former British ambassador to the EU, who helped draft Article 50 - agreed. \"You can change your mind while the process is going on,\" he said. He acknowledged that this might annoy the rest of the EU, and be seen as a huge waste of time. \"They might try to extract a political price,\" Lord Kerr said, \"but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.\" The distinction between political and legal opinion on this issue is critical. The politics might become way too complicated if the UK tried to change its mind. But who might have the final legal say on what could yet become a critical question? Article 50 is a piece of European law, so the ultimate arbiter on this issue is the European Court of Justice. There is an ongoing case in Dublin at the moment that is seeking to refer the question of irrevocability to the European Court to get a definitive answer. One other point is worth bearing in mind: everyone is talking about a two-year period for negotiating under Article 50, at the end of which the UK would leave the EU. But Article 50 does provide for that two-year period to be extended, if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agreed. No-one is advocating that, but it remains a legal possibility. The argument that Article 50 cannot be reversed once it has been triggered has not been tested in court. The rest of the EU has said it does not want the UK to leave, but - politically speaking - it would be very difficult to revoke notification of Article 50, and the current UK government says it has no intention of doing so.

{"article": "The aggressive tumour was found in a 1.7 million-year-old toe from an ancient human ancestor. The toe belonged to one of the early hominins, either Homo ergaster or Paranthropus robustus. The researchers said the findings clearly show cancer is not a disease of modern society, as some people claim. Tumours have been detected in remains before - a Croatian Neandertal who walked the Earth around 120,000 years ago was one of the oldest. The new discovery was made in a toe bone from Swartkrans cave in the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site near Johannesburg. Data, published in the South African Journal of Science, showed the metatarsal had osteosarcoma - a rare and deadly form of bone cancer. Meanwhile, the South African and British researchers also found a benign growth in the backbone of a two million-year-old Australopithecus sediba fossil from the Malapa cave. Despite cancers being detected in a wide range of species, some people believe the disease is a uniquely modern problem. Edward Odes, one of the researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand, said: \"Modern medicine tends to assume that cancers and tumours in humans are diseases caused by modern lifestyles and environments. Our studies show the origins of these diseases occurred in our ancient relatives millions of years before modern industrial societies existed.\" Dr Patrick Randolph-Quinney, from the University of Central Lancashire, told the BBC News website: \"The idea that cancers are recent has come out of work on Egyptian mummies where they failed to find evidence of cancers in X-rays, which has skewed our reasoning on this.\" However, he added that modern lifestyles do increase the risk of some tumours: \"The rise of colorectal cancer with a Western diet, liver cancers from alcohol consumption, lung cancer and smoking are all diseases of modernity. \"There's lots of different causes of cancer and they change through history - if you were a chimney sweep in London you were likely to get lung cancer - a lot is context dependent with new diets and new toxins.\" Hannah Birkett, from the Bone Cancer Research Trust, commented: \"This discovery is really exciting for osteosarcoma and the field of primary bone cancer research as a whole. \"Modern lifestyles and environmental factors loom large in people's perceptions of the cause of cancer and this finding reconfirms the importance of considering other factors such as bone growth. \"This discovery will hopefully open new doors into investigating the cause of osteosarcoma further.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "question": "The earliest evidence of cancer in the human fossil @placeholder has been discovered in a cave in South Africa , an international team of scientists say .", "option_0": "area", "option_1": "history", "option_2": "record", "option_3": "river", "option_4": "valleys", "label": 2}

{"article": "For a man just back from the frontline, Badradeen Hassan seemed remarkably calm. One of the oddities of the conflict with IS is that combatants can be in the midst of fighting one moment, and then back home in less than an hour. Mr Hassan serves with the Peshmerga, the Kurdish forces deployed in the countryside and villages north and east of Mosul. He had returned to the Kurdistan Region's capital, Irbil, for a break, and wanted to share with me his belief that those currently allied against IS would soon turn on each other. \"There are threats against us from the Shia, especially from the Shia militias. For sure, they will declare a war against Kurdistan,\" he said, in a voice whose measured tempo belied the violent scenario he was predicting. Mr Hassan fears that land currently controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government will be claimed by those Shia militia groups. Some of it is rich in oil deposits and is also claimed by the central government. \"Even if it's one inch, there's no way we would let it go. A Peshmerga is willing to fight anyone.\" I heard similar predictions of conflict from new arrivals at the Debaga camp for internally displaced people, in Irbil province. The civilians may have been relieved to escape the fighting in and around Mosul, but few thought this would put an end to their troubles. \"After Islamic State has gone... it will be tribe against tribe,\" one told me. \"There will never be security.\" Another explained that as a Sunni, he no longer felt safe going into Shia areas, and blamed foreign interference for this division. \"Countries like Iran, like Turkey - they don't want Iraq to do well.\" Refugees might be expected to feel anxious about the future, and so too soldiers who have recently been in combat. Yet I heard similarly dire warnings in the calm surrounds of the Irbil-based think tank, the Middle East Research Institute, from its president, Dlawer AlaAldeen. \"There are armed groups, paramilitary groups, state and non-state actors,\" he says. \"It's a recipe for disaster.\" Mr AlaAldeen believes it is too simplistic to see conflict only through the Shia-Sunni-Kurdish prism, as these groups are now further fragmented, and operating in an environment where political leadership from Baghdad is weak or entirely absent. Yet it is not as if the possibility of sectarian conflict has gone un-noticed; indeed desperate attempts are being made to avoid it breaking out. The plan for the Mosul offensive, for example, was as political as it was strategic, aiming to make sure that Shia militias and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters never actually enter what is a predominantly Sunni city. Meanwhile, the President of the Kurdistan Region, Massoud Barzani, made a rare visit to Baghdad recently, where he and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi stood side-by-side, pledging to co-operate rather than fight. \"We don't believe in achieving our goals by violent means,\" insists KRG spokesman Safeen Dizayee. \"Everything has to be by negotiation, to end this one century-old problem between Kurds and the rest of Iraq.\" Recent history only seems to have aggravated divisions between Iraq's ethnic and religious communities, rather than ameliorate it. \"Mosul soon will finish, but I don't think we can live together,\" says Bzhar Dilan, a musician, record producer and well-known figure in Kurdistan's cultural landscape. He insists he wants to be optimistic, but is highly sceptical when it comes to politicians' promises that there can be peace. \"They always say that,\" he scoffs. \"But then it starts again.

{"article": "The Barclay Report into non-domestic rates has also recommended that childcare centres should be exempt. The system had faced strong criticism, particularly from hospitality firms. The review was commissioned by the Scottish government in March last year and headed up by Ken Barclay, former head of Scottish operations for RBS. Scotland's Finance Secretary Derek Mackay welcomed the report and said the government would \"respond swiftly\" to its recommendations. He added: \"I know the review group have worked incredibly hard, spending more than a year engaging closely with the ratepayers across Scotland before compiling this report. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their substantial efforts.\" The report's recommendations included; Mr Barclay carried out his review alongside two business experts, a lawyer and retired civil servant. Its remit was to examine the system in a way that \"encouraged business growth, improves fairness and continues to raise the same total amount for public services\". It looked at radical reforms, and the impact of the digital economy, but concluded that the basis of the current system should be maintained. The review was instructed to be revenue neutral and was not tasked with looking at the controversy surrounding the 2017 revaluation of premises. Business rates are based on the notional rental value for offices, factories, shops, restaurants, hotels, warehouses and public buildings. 230,000 Properties liable for bills 54,000 Shops 44,000 Offices 49,000 Industrial premises 100,000 Small businesses 5,000 Religious premises 1,900 Properties supporting disabled people Ministers remain committed to the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which exempts up to 100,000 properties with lower rental valuations, until at least 2021. That is worth £180m to businesses and much of it was funded this year through the large property supplement. However, the Barclay Report recommended a review of that scheme, questioning whether it was right that some should pay nothing, with a steep rise in costs for those just over the rental threshold of £15,000. It is suggested those being given relief could meet other goals set by government, such as paying the Living Wage, or providing apprenticeships. For many small firms, their business rates bill is the second biggest cost they face, after staff pay. The report aims to close loopholes. That includes short-term relief for empty buildings. It would also require owners of holiday homes, who claim to be renting them as businesses, to prove they are earning money from lets, rather than avoiding residential council tax. The review group wanted to recommend a shift in the annual inflation uplift, replacing the higher measure of the retail price index. But they said this could not be done within their remit of maintaining the total tax take. It has recommended that a roll be kept of almost all rateable valuations of non-domestic property, which would require valuation of farms and forests, while continuing current exemptions for those. In his introduction to the report, Mr Barclay wrote that reduced administration costs should help businesses. He said: \"Revenue raising measures may not be popular with some. They are not about penalising particular sectors. They are about removing anomalies, creating a level playing field and reducing avoidance. \"The 30 recommendations combined will, I believe, improve the economic climate in Scotland and give Scotland a competitive advantage in growing existing businesses and attracting new business.\" By Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland business and economy editor The Barclay Review could have been a lot more radical. The rise of the digital economy is a big challenge to a tax system based on building rental value, and may eventually require radical solutions. But for the 2020s, this review opts for changes to the current system - closing loopholes, levelling the playing field, giving a nudge or two of help to businesses that want to invest, grow and be responsible employers. Anything more radical ran the risk of being shelved. That has happened to reviews of council tax. In the filing cabinet marked \"politically too difficult\", that tax on residential property remains stuck with its 1991 valuations. Anything more radical for business would also have meant divergence from England and Wales.  On the contrary, the Barclay Report recommends that the supplement for bigger properties should be cut, to come into line with the rest of the UK. Devolution was intended to allow for more divergence, and the Scottish National Party has talked about the need to have more business tax powers to help grow the economy. Reform over the past 18 years of the Scottish Parliament has been limited to small business reliefs. It demonstrates that divergence from the rest of the UK is tougher than the rhetoric might suggest, particularly where it risks harm to the economy.", "question": "Leisure centres , some golf clubs , private @placeholder and universities should be brought fully under the business rates system , according to a review .", "option_0": "food", "option_1": "homes", "option_2": "heads", "option_3": "fish", "option_4": "schools", "label": 4}

{"article": "On 9 July the American drinks giant formally requested that Fifa's leadership support the idea. It wants the commission to be overseen by what it described as \"one or more eminent impartial leaders to manage the efforts necessary to help reform Fifa's governance and its human rights requirements\". In correspondence obtained by the BBC, Coca-Cola says: \"We believe that establishing this independent commission will be the most credible way for Fifa to approach its reform process and is necessary to build back the trust it has lost. \"We are calling for this approach out of our deep commitment to ethics and human rights and in the interest of seeing Fifa succeed.\" The move will put pressure on Fifa's outgoing president Sepp Blatter, who will discuss his preferred reform programme with the body's executive committee on Monday. Blatter is expected to propose a number of reforms designed to repair Fifa's battered reputation. These include term limits for members of the executive committee and the president, as well as full salary disclosure for senior officials. However critics of Fifa have argued that it is so discredited that reform should be taken out of the body's control, and they will be encouraged by Coca-Cola's move. In May, trade unions and campaign groups wrote to Fifa's eight biggest commercial partners - Adidas, Gazprom, Hyundai, Kia, McDonald's, Budweiser, Coca-Cola and Visa - asking them to speak out about the treatment of workers in Qatar, host of the 2022 World Cup. The working and housing conditions of migrant construction workers have been heavily criticised. Soon after, Fifa was plunged into the biggest crisis in its history after twin criminal investigations in the US and Switzerland into allegations of corruption. That led to the arrest of senior football officials, and the resignation of Blatter. Sharan Burrow of the International Trade Union Confederation said: \"Coca-Cola sets the benchmark against corruption by supporting the call for an independent reform commission to rebuild Fifa. \"It's now time for the other sponsors to take a stand against corruption and put the game back on track. \"Football and other sports carry the passions of billions around the world, and can effect real change and solidarity, and corruption has no place in this. The workers enslaved in Qatar need to know a Fifa that will demand fundamental labour rights of this nation. \"We back the leadership of Coca-Cola and call on the Fifa executive to do the right thing on Monday. \"An external reform commission led by a man like [former United Nations secretary-general] Kofi Annan, supported by men and women including sport leaders and players with similar integrity, can make the difference.\" Jaimie Fuller of campaign group New Fifa Now said: \"Coca-Cola are to be applauded for having the courage to take an ethical stance on something that is so commercially sensitive. \"It's great that Coke understand and respect the power of sport in society and the good that it can do in the right hands. \"This is completely the reverse to the culture within Fifa and Coke's demand for independent reform is a reflection of true leadership. \"This independent reform needs to be led by an eminent person who enjoys the respect and trust of all cultures, whether they be western, Asian, Latin American or African. \"Fifa has shown the inability to reform itself so it must be in independent hands.\" Coca-Cola and Fifa's other sponsors contribute around £1bn to the organisation each four-year World Cup cycle. In the past they have been criticised for not using their influence enough to force Fifa to enact reform. However Coca-Cola's move represents the most serious example of pressure that Fifa has faced from one of its commercial backers, and there are signs other sponsors may follow suit. On Friday, another sponsor, fast-food giant McDonald's, issued a statement regarding its expectations of Fifa, which it outlined to the governing body last month. \"At McDonald's, we know our customers around the world are passionate about football, and we share their enthusiasm. That's why we've sponsored the World Cup globally for more than 20 years. But recent allegations and indictments have severely tarnished Fifa in a way that strikes at the very heart of our sponsorship. \"As a result, we have expressed our concerns directly to Fifa. We believe Fifa internal controls and compliance culture are inconsistent with expectations McDonald's has for its business partners throughout the world. \"Fifa must now implement meaningful changes to restore trust and credibility with fans and sponsors alike.

{"article": "It's a day of elation and disappointment, but also a time to make decisions. Just over half of pupils got five good GCSEs last summer - that means grades A to C including Maths and English. That leaves four out of 10 children, more in some parts of the country, for whom an academic option is almost immediately closed. They face a bewildering jungle of vocational and technical alternatives, some of which risk leaving them with poor skills and a life-long disadvantage. Today's review by Lord Sainsbury is a serious attempt to make it easier to choose a route that leads to a job and to meet the skill shortages which many employers fear are holding back our economy. More than half of all young people in the UK find their way into work without going to university. A House of Lords committee described this majority earlier this year as too often \"overlooked and left behind\". With the economy facing the challenges of post-referendum uncertainty, and some of the deep divisions in society exposed, a new skills plan is badly needed. The core proposal of 15 routes to an area of skilled employment seems fundamentally sensible. The intention is to create a viable alternative that teenagers can choose at 16 which will allow them to progress towards decently paid work. And the language is interesting too. This is a plan for education in \"technical skills and knowledge\". It's a determined effort to shift away from describing combining study and hands-on experience as \"vocational\". Despite the long tradition of vocational education, it has become tarnished by some low-grade qualifications. But it may prove harder to galvanise the cultural change this review strongly suggests is needed. What is really needed for mainly technical and mainly academic education to have equal status is for more white-collar, middle-class parents to support their children in making this choice. That is a big ask when the graduate premium in earnings remains, albeit with a large dose of debt attached. The other key ingredient will be money, at a time when public finances will be challenged. While school budgets for younger children have been relatively protected, education funding for 16-18 year olds has suffered badly in the years of austerity. The apprenticeship levy on employers is meant to be introduced in April 2017, but many think it will be delayed. If the business climate changes further, there may be pressure to water it down in some way. This isn't the first time an attempt has been made to put technical education on a better footing. It will take several years and commitment, at a time when the government will be stretched, to live up to the hopes of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development for this plan.

{"article": "People with mental health problems have been \"stigmatised and marginalised\", it says, and services have been \"underfunded for decades\". The report, compiled by a panel of NHS and independent experts and due to be published on Monday, does acknowledge that the picture has started to change. It points out that attitudes are improving and there is now a cross-society consensus on achieving change. But it says the the transformation of care will take ten years - and the report marks just the beginning of the process. The 59 recommendations of the report, all of which have been accepted by the NHS England leadership, suggest a determination to shake up all aspects of mental health care. The aim is to have most of the implementation in place by 2020/21, but even by then the report authors admit that parity of esteem between mental and physical health will not have been achieved, though the process will be some way down the track. Mental health care 'is ruining lives' The report does not always make comfortable reading for ministers in the coalition government. A mental health strategy in 2011, says the report, was widely welcomed at the time but it did not successfully address inadequate provision and worsening outcomes. There has been \"chronic underinvestment in mental health care across the NHS in recent years\". The extent of the financial squeeze and divergence of mental and physical health budgets is underlined by findings from BBC Freedom of Information requests. These show that the income of mental health trusts in England fell by 2% in 2014/15 after taking account of inflation. The Health Foundation think tank says that in the same year the income of acute trusts - hospitals dealing mainly with physical health conditions - rose by 2.6% in real terms. In the current financial year, the BBC research shows mental health trust total income is set to rise just 0.3%. Some 29 out of 53 trusts which responded expect that by the end of the financial year their budgets will be lower than the previous year. 0.3% projected rise in the income of England's mental health trusts 29 of 53 trusts in England reported a drop in income 1.4% fall in number of nurses working in psychiatric sectors between 2010-11 and 2014-15 The Department of Health points out that local councils and other organisations also provide mental health services and these are not covered in the BBC research. But mental health trusts account for at least 80% of spending in this area. Ministers and the head of NHS England, Simon Stevens, will argue there will be a real annual funding increase of £1bn for mental health by 2020/21. This will be in addition to the £280m per year already pledged to children and adolescent and perinatal services. Even so, the £1bn is not \"new\" - it comes from the £8.4bn extra already awarded to NHS England for 2020/21 by Chancellor George Osborne. Another problem identified by the report is keeping track of money spent on care of patients with mental illnesses in England. There is said to be \"little or no national data\" for how much of the money is used at local level. Mr Stevens talked of a \"black box\" with regard to data and has demanded more transparency. He knows that if light is not shed in this area it will not be possible to assess progress. The ambitions for the next few years are impressively set out, including the provision of liaison mental health services in all A&E units. The report is honest in cataloguing the failings of the past. But it is interesting to note that the year for delivering the targets is 2020/21 which is after the next general election.", "question": "You do n't need to go further than the first @placeholder in the foreword of the mental health taskforce report to find a bleak assessment of the current state of services .", "option_0": "period", "option_1": "paragraph", "option_2": "body", "option_3": "deterioration", "option_4": "phase", "label": 1}

{"article": "Russian generals said attacks by rebels, some US-backed, had increased sharply over the past 24 hours. Gen Viktor Poznikhir said the rebel groups had \"not met a single obligation\" of the truce. President Vladimir Putin earlier accused the rebel groups of exploiting the ceasefire to regroup. Russian General Vladimir Savchenko said \"the situation in Syria is worsening\", with 55 attacks over the past 24 hours, leading to the deaths of 12 civilians. Gen Poznikhir said Russia, an ally of the Syrian government, was doing all it could to rein in Syrian troops. \"If the American side does not take the necessary measures to carry out its obligations... a breakdown of the ceasefire will be on the United States,\" he said. \"The United States and the so-called moderate groups they control have not met a single obligation they assumed in the framework of the Geneva agreement.\" The terms require moderate rebel groups to separate themselves from jihadists. \"Without separating, the government troops' hands are tied,\" Gen Poznikhir said. \"Our repeated messages to the American side are left without a response.. There is doubt that the US is able to influence the moderate opposition they control.\" Ceasefire breaches have been reported from both sides since the truce began. The US is yet to respond to the latest Russian statements. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry did speak by telephone on Saturday. Mr Lavrov said he had urged the publication of the Syria ceasefire document, echoing a call from Mr Putin, and for US military officials to be deployed to monitor the truce. In televised remarks during a visit to Kyrgyzstan, Mr Putin said Moscow was keeping to its obligations under the truce, and the Syrian government was \"fully abiding\" by the agreement. But he said that the US seemed to be trying to maintain the rebels' military capability in its conflict with the government, adding that this was a \"dangerous path\". \"What we're seeing now is not the separation of the terrorists from the healthy part of the opposition but an attempt by these terrorists to regroup,\" he said. Previously Moscow has threatened to resume air strikes on \"moderate\" rebel groups if this separation did not happen. If the ceasefire holds for seven days, the US and Russia have agreed to plan joint attacks on the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham group, which was previously known as the al-Nusra Front, and on IS. Separately, the UN says it is still waiting to be able to deliver aid to the besieged city of Aleppo. Some 20 trucks have been waiting since Monday for safe passage from Turkey into Syria and on to rebel-held east Aleppo. However, the UN says it has not yet received permits from the Syrian government to allow the trucks into opposition areas, where at least 250,000 people are in desperate need of food and medicine. This was meant to be a trust-building exercise, but nearly a week after the truce began, the blame game has begun. There was deep scepticism from the rebels about details in the plan which called for their separation from extremist groups. That is why they never formally accepted the deal. It was always a major sticking point. Were US backed groups supposed to surrender territory to Jabhat Fateh al-Sham? Or were they required to fight them? It was never clear. Either way, the stipulation would leave them far weaker on the battlefield. But refusing and standing in the way of much-needed humanitarian aid would not have been popular. Now this weekend, the main rebel groups are due to meet to discuss their position. Their mistrust of the government and its Russian allies runs deep. They see the obstruction of aid deliveries on the border as a stalling tactic, and one which they have seen before. If aid doesn't reach besieged areas soon, the ceasefire's days are numbered.

{"article": "Or are you, like the vast majority, at neither end. Are you aspiring to move up the ladder? Struggling to hold on to what you've got? Stuck in the middle? The issue has become a hot one for the economy and for politics. In Britain, in Scotland, in the United States and in many other countries, inequality has become a dominant theme of political debate. It is being given a lot of attention by those in power, including heads of government, central bankers, the International Monetary Fund, even the Davos gathering of the economic elite. Nicola Sturgeon has put the tackling of inequality alongside economic growth as her twin priorities. Prime Minister Theresa May has targeted her political message at those \"struggling to get by\". The UK government has been trying to figure out a way of closing the inequality gap between different parts of the UK, particularly in England. And inequality has been a big driver of the discontent underlying Donald Trump's appeal to American voters - particularly those who have the spending power of their wages stagnate since the 1970s, while the richest have grabbed a sharply rising share of the nation's wealth. In Scotland, you can see where you stand if we imagine the nation as 100 people from one end of the spectrum of income to the other. The person in the middle, at number 50, has earnings of £444. If your earnings are around £236, then you stand with the 10th lowest earner. If your earnings are around £881, you stand with the 10th highest. You may stand in a different place, in relation to others, if we look at the spectrum of wealth, of education or of health. But there's a clear link between those. Some on low income have a good education, or own a big house, but those with low income, little wealth, poor health and low attainment at school are often the same people. Understanding inequality depends heavily on what you measure. At the extremes, inequality has stretched. The gap is big and getting larger. But if you look deeper, that's not so clear. At BBC Scotland, we've been looking in depth at just how unequal Scotland is. We've been asking why that is. How does it compare? How much does it matter? Is it not only inevitable, but a good thing - rewarding those who strive and take risks? And what - if anything - can be done about it? Higher taxes for re-distribution from the Haves to the Have-Nots? Or spending government funds differently? For those who can pay more, should they do so - contributing more through charges, for instance, from student fees, to road tolls, to a contribution for doctor visits, to higher care cost contributions in older age? Or would that undermine the social contract across the inequality spectrum? You might argue that provision for all is essential to maintaining the consensus underlying public services, such as the National Health Service, and therefore the commitment to maintain them. It might be desirable to have lower inequality with higher economic growth. That is the Scottish government's aim. But is it possible? And under what circumstances? If inequality really is a priority, and needs to be tackled, it poses tough questions with no easy political answers. What would be a \"fair\" outcome?

{"article": "For both financial markets and the wider global economy - good news for the US might turn out to be bad news for them. That dysfunctional state of affairs goes a long way towards explaining the weak pace of the global recovery from recession. Financial analysts at Vanda Securities reckon that jobs growth of 180,000 in the month would equate to rising US and emerging market stocks, as the prospect of a rate rise receded, but a rise of 250,000 would see asset prices fall. In other news, for the markets at least, \"bad news would be good news.\" Taking assets prices first, on a simple view, rising employment should be good news for US equities - it heralds more consumer spending and hence stronger demand. Indeed, one could argue that a rise in US interest rates would be a sign that policymakers are optimistic about the US recovery and should even be a sign that corporate profits will continue to rise, boosting stocks. That's an argument I've heard before from central bankers but one that is rarely popular with market participants. To understand why higher interest rates are being equated with weaker stock prices, one has to understand that Western stock markets have been as reliant on cheap money for growth as they have on improving corporate performances. Low interest rates not only make stocks look attractive on a relative basis (the relative returns from stocks appear high when interest rates are low - why keep money in the bank or sick it into bonds when the returns look so low?). In the US there has been an additional - and powerful - link between low borrowing costs and higher equities. Cheap borrowing has allowed companies to take on debt in order to buy back their own stocks pushing up their price. Such buy-backs have been a big driver of the large Wall Street rally since 2009. The economic recovery in the US - and the UK - has not just been accompanied by a big rise in asset prices but even, to an extent, led by that rise. But an asset price-led recovery underpinned by low interest rates is far from ideal. The fact that good news for the real economy may prove to be bad news for assets gives some clues as to the topsy-turvy world we are living in. Then there is the global picture. While a rise in interest rates might be appropriate for the US, it almost certainly isn't for much of the rest of the world where its impact will be felt just as much. Hence the IMF today calling on Western policymakers to hold their fire on rate rises. Economic performance has diverged across the globe - the US and UK recoveries look robust, Europe's growth is moderate but the big emerging economies look to be in trouble. As economies have diverged so too has monetary policy - with rate cuts across the developing world this year and further quantitative easing (electronically creating money) likely from both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank in the months ahead. All at a time when the US Fed (and possibly the Bank of England) look set to start tightening policy. That monetary divergence is playing out in the currency markets, where the story of 2015 has been a strengthening US dollar. Historically periods of rising US interest rates and a strengthening dollar have heralded a tough time for the emerging world. While the Fed takes into account conditions abroad when setting policy, it does so in a second order manner - the question it asks isn't \"what will a hike do to emerging market economies?\" but \"how would a slowdown in emerging markets affect the US?\" Given the Fed is the United States' central bank and not the world's (even if its policy has a major global impact] this is fair enough question. But it goes to the heart of one of the factors that led to the crisis of 2008 - the lack of global policy co-ordination. The monetary, fiscal, trade and exchange rate policies of each country can have a major impact on its neighbours. But with each country setting policy in its own (often short-term) interest, the bigger picture can be, to say the least, sub-optimal. The global economy suffers from a lack of co-ordination and co-operation. The mechanisms to make it work simply don't exist. Even in the eurozone - an example of a dozen-and-a-half countries choosing to pool their economic sovereignty - the toolkit is bare. Debtor states - such as Greece or Spain - that run into trouble can be forced, through strict conditionality on loans, to make changes to their policy, but the creditor states (such as Germany) are subject to just an attempt at moral persuasion. Even though it takes both a debtor and creditor to make a debt problem happen. A 0.25% rise in US interest rates is highly unlikely to derail the world recovery.

{"article": "Supervision and prosecution of the industry lies with the same watchdog - now the Financial Conduct Authority. This system is \"outdated and can be construed as unfair\", warned the influential House of Commons Treasury Committee. It has suggested separating the two functions \"merits reconsideration\". In a report, the committee heaps renewed criticism on regulators for their role in the HBOS bank saga. In 2008, HBOS became part of the Lloyds Banking Group and needed a Â£20.5bn injection from UK taxpayers to prevent it from crashing. The committee, in this report, focused its microscope on regulators and investigators, rather than the bank itself. \"The regulators failed, both before and after the HBOS crisis. Seven years after the bank's collapse, we now know just how badly - and not because the regulators showed a spirit to learn the lessons of the past,\" said Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the committee. The MPs considered a string of reports into the failure of HBOS and action taken by the regulator at the time - the Financial Services Authority (FSA) - as well as evidence given to the committee. Mr Tyrie said: \"The plain fact is that the FSA did not succeed in protecting consumers from spectacular regulatory failures.\" The report described the watchdog at the time - the FSA - as \"not up to the job\" and \"clearly a highly dysfunctional institution\". \"Its legacy continues to pose a major challenge for its successor bodies, particularly the FCA,\" it said. One way to deal with this problem was for the Treasury to study the idea of a new enforcement body, separate from the City watchdog. This was first suggested by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. \"A separate statutory body would bolster the perception of the enforcement function's independence. The current system, whereby the same organisation both supervises, applies and prosecutes the law is outdated and can be construed as unfair,\" the report said. However, the Treasury rejected such a split in 2014, saying that there were \"clear advantages to locating the supervisory and enforcement functions within the same organisation\". Practical and legal issues could also affect the efficiency of regulation, it said at the time. The FCA said: \"We have a range of tools at its disposal of which enforcement is an essential one. We believe that if this regulatory tool is separated from the FCA it would potentially lessen our ability to be an effective regulator and impact our ability to protect consumers and ensure the integrity of the UK financial system.\" In a wide-ranging Treasury Committee report, MPs make other criticisms, including: New powers were now in place, the committee said, to ensure the failures were not repeated, although better regulation was still work in progress. \"Notwithstanding their own failings, prior to the crisis the regulators also lacked some of the tools they needed to supervise the banks,\" the report said. \"The regulators now have these tools. The committee expects the regulators to demonstrate a very high degree of independence, and transparency, in their use.\" The Treasury said: \"Since 2010, we have dismantled the failed tripartite system and put in place a more focused system of judgement-led supervision by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority. We have also hardwired responsibility and accountability into the financial system, with an emphasis on key decision-makers at the top of banks. \"Our reforms directly address the regulatory failings identified in this report.\"", "question": "Punishment of banks that break the @placeholder may be better served by a new enforcer in the light of failures surrounding the HBOS collapse , MPs say .", "option_0": "world", "option_1": "water", "option_2": "rules", "option_3": "pound", "option_4": "fuel", "label": 2}
{"article": "But a survey published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal suggests that people in Britain were far less likely to adopt simple protective measures during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 than those in Argentina, Japan, Mexico and the US. Researchers at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston questioned nearly 5,000 people.  Just 25% of British people surveyed said they more frequently coughed or sneezed into their elbow or shoulder during the pandemic compared with 82% in Mexico and 84% in Argentina. Some 53% of Britons said they washed their hands or used hand sanitizer more frequently, compared with 89% in Argentina, and 72% in Japan and the US. Just 2% of Britons said they avoided hugging or kissing family or friends compared with 46% of those questioned in Mexico and 21% in the US. One of the study's authors, Dr Gillian SteelFisher said: \"The wide variations between countries in our study shows that in the event of another serious outbreak of infectious disease, public perceptions have to be taken into account to best tailor and communicate policy approaches that need public support in each country.\" The study did not set out to find out which of the nations was the most hygienic but rather to see whether increased handwashing and social distancing reduced H1N1 vaccination uptake.  It did not, although overall vaccine rates were low in all the countries. Studies like this clearly have limitations.  These were telephone interviews with the respondents self-reporting their behaviour.  Furthermore, the questions were posed several months after the end of the pandemic so recall may have been shaky. But if the results are accurate the obvious next question is why Britons were less likely to adopt protective behaviour than other countries?  There the survey doesn't help. Mexico was hit first by swine flu and there was a great deal of initial fear and uncertainty about potential danger from the virus. So it understandable that people there took social distancing measures and personal protective behaviour more seriously than in Britain. The supposed differences in behaviour between the US and UK are less easy to explain.  It would have been helpful to have another European country to compare with the UK. Alison Holmes, Prof of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London told me: \"This research is a good starting point but it begs the question, what next?  It is vital that we reflect on how best to communicate public health messages.  We need to be more scientific and understand how people make sense of recommendations.\" That applies to the media as much as to the government and medical profession.  I did many reports stressing the importance of basic hand hygiene - perhaps journalists need to re-think the way they present such information. You may be asking why all this matters at all, given that the vast majority who got swine flu experienced a mild illness? It matters because there are plenty of other bugs out there that will happily hitch a ride on our skin and up our nostrils. Despite all the limitations of the survey it does seem to suggest that not enough of us take hand hygiene and the health of the wider community seriously.  There was a huge response to a blog I did last year about research at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  It suggested that one in six mobile phones is contaminated with faecal matter. Handwashing is not a very exciting or hi-tech public health measure.  It does not grab the headlines like a new wonder drug.  Nonetheless it is one of the most effective means of reducing the spread of viral infections like influenza, rotavirus and norovirus, and bacterial infections that cause diarrhoeal disease.  In the developing world more children die from diarrhoeal disease than HIV/Aids, malaria and measles combined. Good and bad hygiene habits start young. That's why Global Handwashing Day on October 15th will see schools across the UK attempting the break the world record for the largest simultaneous hand hygiene lesson.", "question": "Do you remember the \" sneezing man in a lift \" public health @placeholder ?

{"article": "The cable network's report made an unsubstantiated link between Seth Rich's death and Wikileaks' leak of hacked DNC emails. The victim's own family have debunked the report, imploring Fox News to stop reporting it. Mr Rich, 27, was shot dead in Washington DC, last year. Police say evidence suggests the former Democratic National Committee (DNC) staff member was the victim of a botched robbery. No arrest has been made. On Tuesday, Fox deleted its story, but said it would continue investigating his death. \"On May 16, a story was posted on the Fox News website on the investigation into the 2016 murder of DNC Staffer Seth Rich,\" the network said in a statement. \"The article was not initially subjected to the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting. \"Upon appropriate review, the article was found not to meet those standards and has since been removed.\" Mr Rich was shot in the back on 10 July last year in the north-west of the city at the Bloomingdale neighbourhood, where residents have reported a spate of gunpoint robberies. Following his death, some right-wing media suggested his killing was revenge by figures linked to the Hillary Clinton campaign for allegedly leaking embarrassing DNC emails to Wikileaks. Wikileaks itself fuelled the conspiracy theory by offering a reward for the capture of Mr Rich's killer and hinting that he may have been the source of the emails. No evidence has emerged to indicate that Mr Rich provided the emails to the anti-secrecy organisation. Fox News this month published and aired reports on Washington affiliate WTTG-TV, citing Rod Wheeler, a contributor to the cable network and private investigator, who said he was being paid by the Rich family to look into the murder. He said evidence showed Mr Rich was in contact with Wikileaks before his death. The Rich family rejected his claim and released a statement through a spokesman saying: \"Anyone who continues to push this fake news story after it was so thoroughly debunked is proving to the world they have a transparent political agenda or are a sociopath.\" WTTG-TV later retracted the report, acknowledging Mr Wheeler had no evidence to support the claim. However, the story initially remained on Fox's website. Mr Wheeler told CNN the source for his assertion was a reporter at Fox News. The Rich family sent Mr Wheeler a cease-and-desist letter and threatened legal action if he continued to discuss the case. But Fox News host Sean Hannity continued to fan the conspiracy theory on his show, prompting the family to write a letter urging the programme to stop disseminating the claims. Mr Hannity defended his decision to continue promoting the story on Twitter on Tuesday, suggesting an online entrepreneur, Kim Dotcom, can back up the claim. Mr Dotcom, who is currently fighting extradition to the US from New Zealand on copyright infringement and money laundering charges, said he has evidence to support the conspiracy theory. Brad Bauman, a spokesman for the Rich family, told CNN they were grateful for the retraction. \"The family would like to thank Fox News for their retraction on a story that has caused deep pain and anguish to the family and has done harm to Seth Rich's legacy,\" he said. \"We are hopeful that in the future Fox News will work with the family to ensure the highest degree of professionally and scrutiny is followed so that only accurate facts are reported serving this case.\"", "question": "Fox News has retracted a report about a US Democratic @placeholder employee whose murder last year has fuelled a right - wing conspiracy theory .", "option_0": "carrying", "option_1": "involving", "option_2": "suspected", "option_3": "party", "option_4": "group", "label": 3}

{"article": "The prime minister said a joint GCHQ and National Crime Agency unit would hunt online paedophiles with the same \"effort\" used to track terrorists. Speaking at a London summit, he said online child exploitation existed on an \"almost industrial scale\" worldwide. He also unveiled a law to stop adults sending children \"sexual\" messages. Labour said it had suggested the same law six weeks ago and the government had said it was \"not necessary\". Mr Cameron said the new unit was part of a drive to remove millions of \"sickening and depraved\" images from the internet. The term \"dark net\" refers to parts of the internet that are hidden and can be hard to access without special software, and Downing Street said the new unit would be able to analyse huge volumes of images. Mr Cameron said progress had been made on blocking online abuse images, but added: \"The dark net is the next side of the problem, where paedophiles and perverts are sharing images, not using the normal parts of the internet that we all use. \"What we are doing there is setting GCHQ, our world class intelligence agency, together with the National Crime Agency and we are going to go after these people with every bit of effort that we go after terrorists and other international criminals.\" Mr Cameron said children were being \"abused to order\" by some international gangs. \"One gang in the Philippines was arranging the sexual abuse of children, filming it and then live streaming it to paying customers across the world,\" he said. He said this gang was stopped - and 29 people arrested - after an investigation which began when a British police officer examined a sex offender's computer. He said 15 children, some as young as six, were rescued from their \"living nightmare\". Speaking at the We Protect Children Online summit in London, Mr Cameron said his proposed new law would make it \"illegal for an adult to send a sexual communication to a child\". The law, which would apply in England and Wales, is expected to be included in the Serious Crime Bill currently going through Parliament. Various laws exist in this area, but Mr Cameron said there should be no \"grey areas\". It follows a campaign by the NSPCC charity to close what it dubbed the \"flaw in the law\". Mr Cameron said it would also be made illegal to possess material offering guidance on abusing children - what he called \"paedophile training manuals\". Representatives from more than 50 countries, 23 leading technology companies and nine non-governmental organisations are attending the summit. Mr Cameron said they would sign a \"landmark agreement\" which \"amounts to nothing less than a global war against online child abuse\". As part of the agreement, he said a \"range of countries\" had committed to create \"dedicated law enforcement response\" to tackle child abuse images. He said a new \"global child protection fund\" would be set up, with the UK the first and \"most major\" donor - paying Â£50m over the next five years. Mr Cameron said internet firms had gone \"above and beyond\" what they had been asked to do in terms of blocking access to child abuse images. He also said: Google said it \"aggressively\" removes child abuse images, adding: \"Over the past 12 months our algorithm changes and deterrent campaign have already led to a five-fold reduction in a number of child sexual abuse image-related queries in search.\" Responding to Mr Cameron's comments, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said there were \"very serious gaps\" in the government's plans because \"thousands of cases of abuse are not being followed up by the police\". \"We know the National Crime Agency has details of over 20,000 suspected of accessing images of child abuse under Operation Notarise, and yet they have only investigated a tiny proportion of these - and arrested fewer than 1,000,\" she said.

{"article": "On Saturday, Real Madrid play city rivals Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final in Milan, for a €15m (£12m) match winner's prize, which - with various Uefa bonuses and TV monies - could reach as much as €100m. But the vast sums on offer are the result of a financial ball which was set rolling three decades ago. The summer of 1986 was an important time for the giants of Real Madrid and Juventus. The former had taken a gamble on Dutchman Leo Beenhakker as manager in an attempt to win their first European Cup in more than 20 years. Meanwhile, the Turin club was looking to rebuild the team that had won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1984 and European Cup in 1985. The previous season, 1985-86, had been an unusual one, with upstart clubs from Romania, Sweden and Belgium all reaching the European Cup semi-finals. But with English clubs still banned from Europe, and with star-studded line-ups featuring Michael Laudrup and Michel Platini (Juventus), and Hugo Sanchez and Jorge Valdano (Real Madrid), the big two went into the 1986-87 European Cup with high hopes of reaching the final. However, visions of a dream final were kicked into touch when the pair were dramatically drawn together in the second round of what was then a knockout tournament for national champions only. Not only would one of them be going out of the competition early, but money-spinning opportunities from future ties would disappear. \"The sporting and financial security that exists in today's Champions League, with its group stage, was not on offer then in the European Cup, which was a straight knockout tournament like the FA Cup,\" says Harry Philp, a sports business expert at financial advisory firm Portland Advisers. \"This knockout format was contrary to the interests of major clubs in Italy, which hosted the top league in the world at the time, and of the two Spanish giants, Real Madrid and Barcelona. \"For these clubs there was a financial consideration around playing more games, and naturally there was also the sporting consideration of going as far as they could in the cup.\" He adds: \"After this dramatic European Cup draw, these wealthy clubs started thinking more about a format that would give them the opportunity, or guarantee, of more games in Europe. \"These were clubs that were investing a small fortune in top talent each year, and after such an outlay they wanted some mitigation against a bad draw and being knocked out early.\" The reaction of Real Madrid and Juventus to being drawn together was immediate. The contest meant the losers would be confined to domestic football by the turn of the year after a mere four European games (two rounds of two-legged ties). Juventus president Giampiero Boniperti called for a change in the way the biggest clubs had their opponents selected. \"It is a pity that one of us will not reach the quarter finals,\" he said. \"They should change the way the Champions Cup is organised. Something more like the World Cup seeding system is needed.\" Meanwhile, Real Madrid's World Cup-winning Argentine star Jorge Valdano said the game should have been the European Cup final. And he later lamented: \"It was was a terrible thing for us and Juventus to meet so early in the competition. It should have been a semi-final at least… or the final.\" As Keir Radnedge, editor of World Soccer magazine at the time, observed: \"The giants of Spain and Italy - record championship winners in their own countries, and both former World and European title holders - would happily have waited until next May's final in Vienna [to meet].\" Real Madrid won the tie on penalties after each club had won their home legs 1-0, but ultimately failed at the semi-final hurdle. But behind the scenes the real action began, with lobbying and pressure put on Uefa by the big Italian and Spanish clubs for a format that was more conducive to their needs. \"You had influential personnel at two of the most powerful clubs in Europe coming out with similar statements,\" says Harry Philp. \"I have no doubt that this started the thought processes at Uefa that changes had to be made to the future format of the European Cup, and which led to it morphing into the Champions League.\" A mini-league group-stage system was introduced to the competition in 1991-92, and the following season the group stage was formalised by Uefa, along with a name change to the Champions League. Since that 1992 final, Spanish and Italian clubs have, between them, won 14 of the 24 Champions League finals. Before the changes they had won four of the previous 24. \"We now have a seeding process, just as the big clubs wanted, and the broad upshot is that richer clubs go through, play more games, and get more revenue,\" says Philp. \"The new format has also reduced the chance of a supposed 'lesser club' winning it, although Porto and Dortmund have emerged from the 'second tier' to lift the trophy. Atletico Madrid also came close, and are in this year's final again. But these are the exceptions.\" According to another expert, other factors also influenced the change from FA Cup knockout format to the Champions League. Prof Sean Hamil, from Birkbeck Sport Business Centre at the University of London, says in addition to pressure from major continental clubs, the development of pay-per-view TV technology in the late 1980s and early 1990s also meant there was a demand for more games to broadcast. \"There was a coming together of new broadcasting firms looking for exciting sporting product, and, increasingly, a new breed of entrepreneur taking over football clubs who felt they were not making the money that they should,\" he says. \"You were getting an embryonic nexus of more far-sighted entrepreneurs in both football and TV.  In addition there was a more progressive and aggressive marketing of its major club tournament by Uefa. \"It was a volatile time in many ways, there was also football hooliganism and the ban on English teams in Europe, but Uefa managed to keep the big show together effectively, by being all things to all people.\" And as global fan, TV and sponsor interest in the glitz and glamour of the Champions League shows, Europe's premier club competition has come a long way in 30 years.", "question": "Thirty years ago , the draw for the second round of the European Cup conjured up a @placeholder - watering Spanish v Italian match , one that would play a role in the formation of an expanded competition - what we now know as the Champions League .", "option_0": "corner", "option_1": "mouth", "option_2": "team", "option_3": "hand", "option_4": "record", "label": 1}

Hamas spokesman Abdul-Latif Qanou called it a \"heroic\" act and encouraged other Palestinians to \"escalate the resistance\".

{"article": "\"Good morning! We have a new constituent assembly!\" began President Nicolás Maduro as he greeted his supporters in the Plaza Bolívar in Caracas shortly after the electoral authorities announced the result. The country's National Electoral Council said that just a little over eight million ballots had been cast for members of a a new assembly designed to change the country's constitution, a turnout of 41.53% of the electorate. But the opposition boycotted the vote, guaranteeing victory for the country's socialist government, which had convened the vote. Amid the electoral violence, at least 10 deaths were reported across the country. However President Maduro faces a real challenge of governability and credibility. Perhaps the biggest is that every opposition supporter, and many millions of ordinary Venezuelans, simply do not believe the result. \"The government will claim eight million votes, but in reality it could have been about 3.5 million people,\" predicted pollster Luis Vicente León a day before the poll. The opposition say several irregular electoral processes took place that in normal Venezuelan elections would not be allowed. For example, no indelible ink was used to mark voters' little fingers after the ballots had been cast and critics say there was nothing to stop people voting in more than one polling centre. There were also widespread reports of pressure being brought to bear on government employees to turn out in order to protect their jobs. Several countries in the region - including Colombia, Argentina and Panama - said they would not recognise the result. The United States also threatened \"strong and swift action\", with the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, calling the vote a \"sham election\" that brought Venezuela \"another step toward dictatorship\". Nevertheless, the Maduro government is treating this result as a resounding endorsement and will press ahead with its plans to change the constitution. The first steps towards creating the new body could take place within 24 hours. In part, the difficulty the Maduro government has faced in motivating its base stems from the many years they spent vociferously defending the same constitution they are now urgently trying to change. Hugo Chávez himself often described the 1999 Constitution in sacred terms, comparing it to the Bible or the Mayan holy text, Popol Vuh. The approach of most government officials has been twofold. In part, they say the creation of a constituent assembly is the easiest route to peace - something that most ordinary Venezuelans are desperate to see return to their daily lives. They also argue that this constitutional change is part of a vision of a \"deeper\" form of popular democracy that the late socialist leader was never able to fully realise before his death in 2013. If so, however, he never made any great references to it while he was still alive: \"Our constitution, one of the best in the world, is protected from the caprice of any political group,\" he said in 2008. \"In Venezuela, no-one can change a comma, a full stop, a letter of our Bolivarian Constitution. Only the Venezuelan people can do that through a national referendum,\" Mr Chávez explained. A pro-government candidate standing in a low-income neighbourhood in the east of Caracas, Joaquin Mijares, denied that the vote was unconstitutional. \"The constituent assembly will be a space to discuss the direction of the country and how the state is organised,\" he said outside his local polling station. \"The process is legitimate because we, the people, are legitimising it with our participation.\" However, the haemorrhaging of traditional Chavista support goes beyond this one controversial political process. It comes after months of food shortages, rampant inflation and worsening violence. One does not have to look hard for signs of public exhaustion with the Maduro government. \"Sadly, my President, Hugo Chávez, died. Very sadly, because if he were alive, none of this would be happening,\" said Beatriz, a housewife in Catia, in western Caracas. \"I'll stay Chavista until the very end but I'm no Maduro supporter,\" she added.  It is a position shared by many others among the nation's poor. There is a uniquely Venezuelan word to describe the street closures and subsequent clashes with the authorities: \"guarimba\". Now, with the votes cast, there is still no sign of the barricades and protests letting up. If anything, positions are becoming more entrenched. \"The Resistance\" - a loose alliance of young, radicalised opposition protesters - have vowed to remain on the streets until the government concedes to their demands. \"We're going to be here until this country changes, until it improves, until the government falls,\" a 17-year-old protester manning the barricades told me. \"We need a president who's dignified enough to be called the president of Venezuela and an end to the shortages and queues.\" The traditional opposition alliance, the MUD, also appears to remain committed to a campaign of demonstrations and civil disobedience. The government places the blame for the violence firmly at the door of the opposition. But the head of the National Assembly, Julio Borges, denied that the MUD was responsible for leading the country down a path towards further conflict. \"We are not involved in a civil war in Venezuela,\" he said. \"What we have in Venezuela is one people, one nation that is against a minority that has kidnapped power in the country.\" On the other side, the military and the security forces are not backing down either. Despite suggestions of disillusionment among some sectors of the rank and file, there is little hard evidence of a genuine split or mutiny. Both before the vote and in his victory speech, President Maduro spoke of dialogue. Some nations have been trying to table negotiations between the two sides with figures like former Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero attempting to broker some form of peace. Spain, in particular, would want to see a stable Venezuela sooner rather than later, given its business interests in the South American nation. However, there is little sign of a breakthrough. If anything, the decision to plough ahead with the election, despite widespread opposition, may have jeopardised any chance of further conversations for the time being. Furthermore, despite the unity in the name of the opposition alliance, in reality the parties remain divided, split and without a clear leader who inspires Venezuelans. As such, the immediate outlook is bleak, says Luis Vicente León. \"It's absolutely going to get worse before it improves.\" \"The two groups both think they are in power. They both think they are going to destroy the other, that they are going to pulverise each other.\" Such \"mutually assured destruction\", he argues, does nothing to tackle the problems of inflation, scarcity, poverty, lack of medicines and so on that have plagued Venezuela in recent years.

{"article": "Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has been one of sport's most high-profile successes of recent years - thrilling television audiences and drawing crowds to fight nights with its combination of wrestling, boxing, jiu-jitsu and kick boxing. The mixed martial arts (MMA) brand has made household names of Irish fighter Conor McGregor and female champions Ronda Rousey and Holly Holm. But when the UFC jamboree came to Singapore, it was just the latest effort by the brand to try and replicate the success it has in the US in Asia, after years of setbacks and struggles. The league wants to make this wealthy South-East Asian city state an annual stopover on its international tour - along with the likes of Macau, Manila, Tokyo and Seoul. With a 12-bout fight card, its event drew a crowd of more 8,000 spectators, doubling its debut showing in 2014. And for local fans of the controversial combat sport, it was a rare opportunity to experience fight night in the flesh. \"Since most of the shows are in the US, it's great to be able to watch such a big event live here in Singapore with such big names coming here,\" one fan told me. Of course, growing popularity goes hand-in-hand with growing profits. UFC expects income of about $50m (Â£38.8m) from the region this year. That would be about 6% to 8% of its global revenues. \"Soccer is always going to be on top, but UFC is the fastest-growing sports organisation in the world,\" says Joe Carr, UFC's senior vice president of international and content. \"There's no reason why UFC can't be up there with other sporting heavyweights like the National Basketball Association or the National Football League in this market.\" For most other sports though, cracking Asia involves cracking China. Critics note UFC's big push to enter the Chinese market back in 2014. Within a year, it was forced to shut its Beijing operations without a fight being held, and relocate to Singapore. Not deterred, the league is trying again with its first bout in mainland China, scheduled for November in Shanghai. China does have a growing MMA market, one dominated by rival leagues, including the local Kulun Fight tournament. \"It will be an absolute uphill battle because they don't bring their A-game to Asian cities. Their events in Asia are typically smaller shows,\" said Marc Raimondi, assistant editor at MMAFighting.com. \"The UFC makes the bulk of its money in the US and Canada. So from a business perspective, it makes sense for them to put their biggest stars on those cards. \"But they really need bigger stars and bigger shows in Asia. They just don't have the kind of Asian talent to compensate and draw a ton of interest in the local markets.\" Most in the sport agree that developing local heroes is a sure fire way of creating local fans. But will UFC be able to produce an Asian star to compare with the likes of McGregor, Rousey and Holm? \"An Asian world champion, a man or woman who becomes a world UFC champion, will be the catalyst to Asia going mainstream, just like Europe did with Conor McGregor,\" says UFC's chief executive, Dana White. \"Women all over the world got into this sport through Ronda Rousey. If we can find a talented man or woman from Asia, and they become a world champion, the market will explode.\" But the league currently only has 40 Asian fighters on its roster. The hopes of finding the next superstar rest on the likes of aspiring champion, Rolando Dy from the Philippines - the son of a former world champion boxer. He made his UFC debut in Singapore, and despite a defeat, cannot be accused of lacking confidence. \"I am a Filipino fighter, and you don't underestimate fighters from the Philippines,\" he said, referring to the achievements of his father, Rolando Naverette, as well as boxing legend, Manny Pacquiao. \"It's my time. I believe I am one of the best in the world, and just have to prove it so that people will also believe in me.\" Rolando Dy will get his next shot at proving himself when he fights in Japan in September. UFC estimates that a third of its fanbase is based in Asia. This is, after all, the region where most martial arts - on which this sport is based - began. But with its other regional rivals having already spent years nurturing home-grown talent, the battle for commercial success will have to be fiercely fought.", "question": "There was @placeholder , there was sweat and , if not tears , plenty of cheers .", "option_0": "launched", "option_1": "opened", "option_2": "announced", "option_3": "unveiled", "option_4": "blood", "label": 4}

{"article": "Protesters have argued that the views of the colonial politician are incompatible with an \"inclusive culture\" at the university. Oriel College says it will consult on the statue's future - and has decided to remove a plaque to Rhodes. The college says it does not \"condone his racist views or actions\". The campaign to remove the Oxford statue follows a university protest in South Africa. A statue of Cecil Rhodes was attacked and then ultimately taken down at the University of Cape Town, after being identified by protesters as a symbol of a colonial, pre-apartheid era. Rhodes had been a strong advocate of colonial power in Africa. But his name is also attached to Rhodes Scholarships which bring overseas students to Oxford University - past beneficiaries include former US president Bill Clinton. The Rhodes Must Fall campaign in South Africa has been adopted in Oxford - and in the next six months the college will decide on what should happen to its statue. Among the options will be to leave it in place, to add some information explaining the historical context, or to remove the statue completely. Cecil Rhodes attended Oriel College and and left money to the college on his death in 1902. The college says his legacy might include the scholarships, but his \"values and world view stand in absolute contrast\" to a modern university. Oriel says the experience of ethnic minority students needs to improve at Oxford and that his links with the college do not reflect any \"celebration of his unacceptable views and actions\". A statement from the college says a plaque erected in his honour on a college building in 1906 will be taken down, pending the consent of the local council. The statue is also in a college building with listed status, which raises questions about what could be changed. \"In the short term, we have put up a temporary notice in the window of the High Street building, below the statue, clarifying its historical context and the college's position on Rhodes,\" says a college statement. The argument in Oxford is part of an international pattern of students challenging university symbols and accusing them of promoting a racist legacy. There has been a wave of protests in dozens of United States universities this autumn, many focusing on emblems which they accuse of racist links. At Harvard University, there have been campaigns to change a university emblem which includes the coat of arms of a slave-owning family. University house masters have also agreed to drop the title \"master\" because of its associations with slavery. At Amherst College, there has been a campaign against a mascot, based on an 18th Century general who had advocated killing the local Native American population by deliberately giving them smallpox. There have also been opponents of changing such symbols, who have argued that universities have to reflect the reality of views held in previous eras.", "question": "An Oxford college is considering removing a statue of the 19th Century politician , Cecil Rhodes , in @placeholder to a student anti-racism campaign .", "option_0": "hardware", "option_1": "order", "option_2": "tribute", "option_3": "answer", "option_4": "response", "label": 4}

It was just one of those sorts of moments,\" she told Newsbeat. \"We heard that the Philae lander bounced and it went a kilometre up in the air and I think I was almost a kilometre up in the air when I was bouncing with joy when we heard the first announcement.\" VIDEO: Newsbeat remixes the sound of the #cometlanding The mission to land a probe on the comet, called 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, was launched in 2004. It should help us learn about the origins of the Solar System. \"We're going to analyse the comet,\" says Monica. \"We're going to sniff it. We're going to melt some of it. We're going to burn some of it. \"The biggest thing we'll learn is what comets have to do with life on earth. One of the most important things that space missions do is bring to people's attention how exciting it is, what a challenge it is.\" The robot probe is the size of a washing machine. It was dropped from the Rosetta satellite and spent seven hours travelling down to the comet. \"If one person is inspired to go into science because of seeing what Rosetta has been doing, seeing the excitement of Philae, then it's worthwhile,\" says Monica. The comet is about 300 million miles away (500 million km), far beyond Mars and is racing through space at about 34,000 mph (55,000 km/h).

{"article": "Analysis by market researchers Mintel, commissioned by the BBC, shows that 35% of British people over 51 are single, at a time when the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show 42% of marriages in England and Wales end in divorce. Despite this, the ONS said there has been a sharp increase in the over-60s tying the knot again, with the number of second-time brides and grooms increasing by 21% and 35% respectively between 2011 and 2012. Meanwhile, the baby boomer generation has also discovered the possibilities of finding love online, with internet sites proving the fourth most popular way to meet a new partner behind family and friends, socialising or work, according to a survey conducted by Mintel of 2,000 people in the UK. BBC local radio stations are telling the stories of how people are finding love a second time around - these are some of those tales. Mintel found more than one in five 55-64 year olds in Britain had met a new partner or date through a website or app. Caroline - not her real name - turned to internet dating after leaving her husband of 25 years. The 55-year-old from Tunbridge Wells in Kent said she has found the experience of online dating \"liberating\". \"I find it a very empowering and rewarding experience. I've gone out for drinks and met men who were really very nice,\" she said. \"I think I've been fairly upfront with people and said I'm a sensuous and passionate woman, whether it's food, love or sex. \"It's quite hard to write something about yourself and I think that's the first step - to really talk about who you are and what you want.\" About 13% of those interviewed by Mintel between the ages of 55-64 said they had been in love with five or more people. For Midge and Geoff, love certainly was better the second time around. The pair, from Carlisle in Cumbria, are both divorced. Keen cyclists, they met at a tandem bicycling club 20 years ago. Midge, 70, said: \"I remember thinking to myself one day, 'I wonder if anyone will ever love me or make love to me again?' And I thought, 'probably not'. Then a year later, I met Geoff. \"I just sort of fell into it, head over heels. It was like being a teenager, I couldn't think of anything else. It was crazy for a time and when it all settled down, it was still exciting.\" Geoff, 75, said his first impressions of his partner were how \"young and beautiful\" she was. \"After what I'd been through [in my previous marriage], she was a breath of heaven. If I live to 80 or 90, it will be a pleasure every day.\" The ONS have only recently looked into same-sex marriage statistics for the first time after they became legal in England and Wales last year. It is yet to release any figures but initial impressions show coming out later in life has become a growing trend. Stephen, 52, was in what he described as a \"good marriage\" with a woman, but after a chance meeting with a man at a party, he realised he had been hiding his true sexuality. \"The next morning I woke up and I realised I was smitten and once someone got a bit of my heart, that's when my perspective opened up and that's when I go an insight into myself,\" he said. \"I realised that I was gay-gay-gay. It was like opening Pandora's Box.\" Roger, 65, knew he was bisexual in his early 20s but didn't come out until years later for various reasons. \"I was in teaching, another was my parents would never understand and the third was I couldn't walk into Croxley Baptist Church again with Mr Right on my arm. \"So it had to be Miss Right and that's how I carried on my life.\" After coming out, he met Ross, 71, and they became civil partners before marrying. Together they run an LGBT lunch club in Croydon called Silver Rainbow. It's in image often perpetuated in films - the older man with a flash car and a young blonde on his arm. John, 65, was putting a failed marriage behind him when he met Angela, 37, at a club.  Before long they were in a committed relationship, despite the age difference of almost three decades. \"There's this perception of older guys with young girls that are trophy brides and I daresay some of that goes on, but not in our case,\" said John. \"It's a relationship of equals, age is immaterial. The only time we think about it is if someone asks us.\" \"To tell the truth my mum wasn't really keen [at first],\" said Angela. \"But I said to her John was important to me and he was my partner and if she had a problem with that, we were going to have a problem. \"She realised he was just a nice guy.\"", "question": "Dating websites and apps are bringing a spark of @placeholder to those searching for love later in life .

{"article": "The officer, named by the rebels as Yuriy Suprun, was seized on 8 April. The UN says talks about his release have reached a sensitive phase. Although a ceasefire is in place, levels of violence have increased dramatically in recent weeks. Almost 9,200 people have died since conflict broke out in April 2014. Large swathes of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk were seized by pro-Russian rebels after Russia responded to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych by annexing Crimea from Ukraine. While the current ceasefire is monitored by the international security body OSCE, the UN is carrying out a humanitarian mission in Donetsk and Luhansk. Meanwhile, after a long period of political instability in Kiev, two of Ukraine's biggest parties have reached agreement on appointing parliament speaker Volodymyr Groysman as prime minister. The UN has given no details about the captured officer's identity or his role in eastern Ukraine but says it has \"mobilised all channels\" to secure his release. Ukrainian MP Iryna Herashchenko said he was part of the UN's monitoring mission and had been detained in a basement. However, the rebels said he had come to their territory without proper notice and was being held while his status was clarified. In a statement, the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) said it suspected the officer, whom it identified as a colonel in Ukraine's SBU security service, of involvement in the \"state coup in 2014\" as well as the Ukrainian army's operation in the east. If confirmed, the DPR said it would discredit the peacekeeping nature of the UN and would be unacceptable. His capture has come at a delicate moment, when both sides have reported an increase in violence. The rebels said one of their fighters had been killed and two civilians wounded in the past two days by Ukrainian army fire. The army said eight of its soldiers had been wounded in a 24-hour period. An army spokesman said the situation in the Donetsk sector was \"difficult\" and that there had been an escalation of violence near the Ukrainian costal city of Mariupol, to the south. The town of Avdiivka has come under repeated mortar fire. Why Ukraine's reformists yearn for change - by Kiev correspondent Tom Burridge Crimean Tatars uneasy under Russian rule President Petro Poroshenko is expected to promise Mr Groysman's nomination in parliament on Thursday. Although Mr Groysman's likely cabinet is seen as pro-EU and anti-corruption, no positions have been given to the foreign technocrats brought in by Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk's previous government to tackle Ukraine's endemic corruption. Among the key names missing are US-born former Finance Minister Natalia Yaresko and her adviser, Slovak politician Ivan Miklos. Mr Yatsenyuk resigned on Saturday, having failed to implement reforms required by the IMF as part of a $17.5bn (Â£12bn; â‚¬15bn) rescue loan. Part of the loan has been suspended until a government is formed. \"I want to stress that this government, if it is formed, will tolerate absolutely no corruption.\" Mr Groysman said. In a separate development, the authorities in Crimea announced the suspension of the Tatar population's self-styled parliament, the Majlis. Prosecutor Natalya Poklonskaya said the Mejlis could not hold any public events or other activity and called for it to be branded a \"terrorist organisation\", reports said. The move was immediately criticised by rights group Amnesty International , which complained that it was aimed at \"snuffing out the few remaining voices of dissent in Crimea.\" Tatars have lived in Crimea for hundreds of years but were deported by Stalin en masse in 1944 after being accused of collaboration during the Nazi occupation.

But stewards took no action following an investigation that established Mercedes had operated the car safely. \"It is about the procedure when you measure the tyre,\" Toto Wolff said. Wolff, Mercedes' F1 boss, said the team had correctly followed the procedure for measuring the tyre pressures established by manufacturer Pirelli but that they had been measured by governing body the FIA outside the stipulated period. Media playback is not supported on this device The FIA referred the issue to the race stewards after Hamilton's left-rear tyre was found to be 0.3psi below the minimum requirement, after the signal indicating five minutes to go before the start of the race. But Wolff said the procedure agreed with Pirelli had been to measure the pressure before that. \"We followed the procedure established with Pirelli, which was to have the tyres in the blankets, check the pressures together with Pirelli,\" Wolff said. \"The pressures were well above the minimum because safety is important for us. The tyres on the car - for whatever reason, maybe because the tyres cooled down - a different pressure was found on one of the tyres. It was a tiny discrepancy.\" The stewards said in their verdict that the electric blankets that maintain the tyre pressures had been disconnected. Wolff said that the FIA needed to make clear a specific procedure that was clear to all before the next race in Singapore on 18-20 September. He also said he could \"absolutely rule out\" any attempt to let the tyre pressure drop before the race in search of a performance advantage. Media playback is not supported on this device A higher pressure limit was set by Pirelli for the Italian race after two high-speed failures at the previous race in Belgium. \"We have worked the whole week after Spa with Pirelli to find solutions in order to make those tyres safe,\" Wolff said. \"We were very much part of trying to guide them on minimum tyre pressures and minimum camber, which we already had on our car at Spa. \"So I can rule out that we would be the ones who were trying to gain an advantage in a way which is absolutely unscientific and uncontrollable.\" Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg was also found to have a too-low tyre pressure - by 1.1psi in his case.

{"article": "After the US sportswear company took action, Swiss watch maker Tag Heuer was quick to end its association with the five times Grand Slam winner, and German luxury car marque Porsche said it was postponing any planned activities with her. Sharapova revealed on Monday that she had tested positive for the banned substance meldonium at the Australian Open in January, and faces a ban from tennis of up to four years. Big-name global companies have been attracted to the Russian star for her mix of athleticism and glamour since she won Wimbledon in 2004 at the age of 17. According to US business magazine Forbes, the 28-year-old is now the world's top-earning female sports star, raking in a total of $29.7m last year. Tellingly, the vast majority of that money - some $23m - came from endorsements.  And it is the biggest of those endorsements - her eight-year, $70m deal with Nike, which runs until 2018 - that is now under threat. Sharapova is the latest Nike athlete to become embroiled in controversy, with a number of big names before her being dropped, while others have been retained but had the value of their deals slashed. These dropped include cyclist Lance Armstrong, convicted athlete Oscar Pistorius, and boxer Manny Pacquiao, while those in the latter category reportedly include Tiger Woods. Karen Earl, chairman of the European Sponsorship Association, says: \"I can't help feeling that Nike has been burnt before; they have stayed with people like Lance Armstrong in the past, and maybe they are just being rightly cautious now. \"The use of a suspension is interesting - basically they are saying they will sit and see how things go. Given their recent experiences that is probably a sensible move. I think they have done the right thing this time round. Nike can now have the option of jumping either way,\" she tells the BBC. Meanwhile, Tag Heuer has been more blunt and \"decided not to renew the contract with Ms Sharapova\", while Porsche has been more cautious, preferring to put its activities on hold. Now all eyes will be on her other commercial partners - Avon Cosmetics, Evian, Head and skincare brand Supergoop, to see what they do, or whether she is now a tarnished brand for sponsors. Sharapova also has her own confectionery business, Sugarpova, launched in 2011, with sales last year of more than three million bags of sweets. \"These other sponsors will be thinking about what they should do now,\" says Mrs Earl. \"In the short-term her continued appeal to sponsors will depend on what action is taken by the tennis and doping authorities. \"In the longer term if all seems to be forgiven, and she is not out of the game for longer than the one year that is being talked about, then it might not matter to them as much. Mrs Earl adds: \"But if she is not seen to be forgiven by tennis, then sponsors will find her less appealing. It all depends what happens in the next few weeks.\" The International Tennis Federation (ITF) has said the five-time Grand Slam champion will be provisionally suspended from 12 March. Whatever happens with regards to any bans, Sharapova, who turns 29 in April, says she hopes to be able to return to tennis in the future. Mrs Earl says that Sharapova's media conference, pre-empting any statement from the tennis authorities, was an interesting move, and one designed to appeal to fans. \"However there are details about what she or her advisors knew which have still to emerge,\" she adds. She points out that while Nike is sitting on the fence, other brands such as Tag Heuer have taken \"a stand against drug taking and disassociated its brand\" from Sharapova. Mrs Earl says sponsors have behavioural clauses in their deals with sports stars that allow them to end the contract if players transgress through drugs or in other ways. \"If  you are working with individual sports stars or sports teams, brands such as Nike have teams of lawyers to include contract clauses that offer protection against potential risks,\" she adds. Andy Brown, editor of the website Sports Integrity Initiative,  says these legal clauses are all about protecting sponsor brands from being brought into \"disrepute\". He says that while such \"break clauses\" are now common in sponsor contracts, this was not always the case, and that their introduction was greatly hastened by the past scandals around the Tour De France. \"It is something that any savvy lawyer representing a brand should be putting into sports contracts,\" Mr Brown says. And Nigel Currie, an independent sponsorship consultant, says that five years ago the sponsors would not have reacted in the way they have. \"In the olden days the sponsors would not have done a thing and would have hoped the problem would just have gone away,\" he says. \"Now, brands are not only paranoid about their image, but also firms are increasingly focused on corporate social responsibility issues in a way they were not before.\" For now, Sharapova must wait to see which way Nike jumps and whether it makes the suspension permanent. \"She's a one-woman marketing machine, there are lots of male stars in the world, but not many female stars, so it will be interesting to see what Nike - having made their initial reaction - do next,\" Mr Currie adds.

Her aunt asks me to translate what the English-speaking medical team is saying, but she can see what is happening. The medics try their best, but Sakina is dying in front us. In Old Mosul, thousands of civilians are trapped and full of fear. Air strikes, sniper fire, shelling and roadside bombs mean no place in the Old City is safe. Residents are being forced to make impossible life-or-death choices as they seek to flee the violence. Explosions shake the hospital, which lies only 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the frontline. The staff say they do not feel in danger, but the workload is heavy. In early June they had three days in a row when 80 to 90 patients arrived all at once. Hundreds of civilians arrive every week with terrible wounds. Bomb blasts throw small stones deep into young bodies, a sickening kind of shrapnel that explodes up in anger from the very streets where these children used to run and play. There is no child's play now. There are no fairy tales here. Mosul's young have been plunged violently into a real-life horror story that seemingly has no happy ending. Parents are sucked into this horror story too - one with many chapters. There is the father who carried his two-year-old into the hospital, suffering from a large gunshot wound to the head. And another who calmly asked a medical colleague for 22 body bags, because all of his family had been wiped out. A surgeon helped him with his request, but only after going behind a wall to cry. Local staff are doing all they can. Some are not paid anymore, including the Iraqi medical team. Some receive incentives. Many do not, but they are still here helping. It is incredible. I make a decision. I am here to take pictures, but I ask myself: \"What am I doing behind my camera? I took some first aid courses so I am sure I can help, if only a little?\" Doctors begin giving me tasks: \"Take the bandage.\" \"Put pressure on the wound.\" \"Quickly, over here.\" I see another child who is wailing. I try to speak to her to calm her. She says: \"I don't want to live without my mom. I wish I was the one who stepped on the mine.\" Her face is full of shrapnel. It is the first time I have seen someone bleed from the eyes. She asks: \"Am I blind?\" She keeps screaming. She is terrifying everyone. I am from Lebanon and I have seen lots of war. I am not afraid of shelling and shooting. But today I can see that our basic humanity is under attack. I appeal to all sides in this conflict to protect civilians. Protect them all as if they were your own loved ones. Let them escape. Give them food, water and shelter. Respect the laws of war for the sake of all of us. My thoughts once again turn to Sakina. After she died, her aunt left the room and I followed. We cried together. I was hugging a total stranger but it felt like I was hugging my own aunt. She told me Sakina's mother and siblings had already been killed. I now come face to face with Sakina's father, who has arrived at the hospital. He is calm, silent, but clearly deeply traumatised. There is an Arabic saying: \"There are a million words behind the silence.\" This is all too true as we look at each other, saying nothing. Of the 45 patients who arrived at the hospital today, four died. I take my camera, my pictures and my memories away with me at the end of a hot and horrendous day. The work will go on. Patients will be cared for, beds will be changed. Floors will be cleaned.

{"article": "A report from the Centre for Social Justice claims the gangs are several steps ahead of the authorities. BBC News has visited one Slovakian village where homes are alleged to have been built with trafficking profits. The government said recent legal changes would make it harder for people to be exploited in the UK. But Fiona Cunningham, a former Home Office adviser and author of the Centre for Social Justice report, told BBC News that the \"organised criminality that lies behind this modern form of slavery is pretty much endemic now\". The report calls on the government to increase cross-border police operations in order to tackle the problem. Though the government estimates there are around 13,000 trafficking victims in the UK, experts said the figure was conservative. The European Union's (EU) open borders policy has facilitated many opportunities for trafficking people. Ms Cunningham said: \"Organised crime groups find the trafficking of victims to be a highly lucrative and accessible crime to pursue and as such have become highly sophisticated in developing illegal business models.\" In Slovakia, most of the 170 trafficking victims that have received support in recent years have been exploited in the UK. \"The forms of trafficking are combined,\" said Anna Bartosova from the Catholic charity Caritas, which works with victims in Slovakia. \"They force them to work and they use their documents for benefit fraud.\" Since the UK opened its borders to people from EU accession countries in 2004, hundreds of people have moved to Britain from the small village of Pavlovce nad Uhom in eastern Slovakia. Most of the villagers, who are overwhelmingly Roma, came here to work. But BBC News has been told that some have since become engaged in trafficking people to the UK, or exploiting individuals when they are already in Britain. Local social worker Yves Ogou told the BBC: \"Pavlovce is the capital city of human trafficking in eastern Slovakia.\" The village has been transformed in recent years by the money made in the UK by villagers. Two storey, multi-coloured brick homes, some with CCTV cameras, are replacing the small wooden or concrete shacks that people used to live in. While most have been built with money legally acquired, Mr Ogou says a few have been built with the proceeds of human trafficking. Some criminals have engaged in fraud, taking people to the UK, stripping them of their documents and claiming child benefit for children that do not exist or that are not their own. \"It's stupid, unbelievable,\" said Mr Ogou. \"Within one minute you can check if the guy has a kid here or not. And you don't.\" A few miles away from Pavlovce, in a small village, we found two families whose daughters are living in England, married to Pakistani men. Though both said the marriages were legitimate, a man from the village was convicted in Manchester last month of arranging sham marriages. One local told me he had heard the going rate for marrying a Pakistani man - allowing the groom to gain access to an EU passport - was \"between 2,000 and 3,000 Euros\". Legal loopholes in the registration of marriages in Britain have previously allowed the marriages to take place, according to experts. The report highlights how the internet has made it easier to entice and control people, with criminals at times using webcams to monitor their victims. But word of mouth is still a prevalent recruitment tool.  One victim was enticed to come to Britain after talking to a man who promised him work. Within days of arriving here, his documents had been taken from him, the first step in eight years of beatings and exploitation as he was forced to travel the country - working first for Slovak and then Irish Roma gangs. \"Every day they beat me, broke my leg, my ribs, my nose,\" said the man, who does not want to be identified.  \"All the money went to them, nothing for me.\" Last month, police raided properties in Berkshire, London and Yorkshire as part of a clampdown on human trafficking. Officers made arrests and recovered victims after an 18-month investigation known as Operation Rehoboam. On Tuesday, four Slovakians were arrested in Newcastle as part of a nationwide operation tackling human trafficking. In recent days, EU ministers have met in Luxembourg to discuss the ongoing migration crisis in the Mediterranean. Several hundred people are feared to have drowned over the weekend, after their boat capsized. On Monday, the EU's head of foreign affairs, Federica Mogherini, said the EU had finally woken up to the evil of human trafficking. The European Commission has come up with plans to try to deal with the crisis - including increasing the size of Europe's naval operations in the Mediterranean. Speaking ahead of the talks, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said a \"comprehensive, European-level response\" was needed in order to target the criminals \"managing this traffic in human suffering\".

{"article": "Vince Cable and Ed Davey complained to David Cameron at a recent Cabinet meeting over slow emails and other IT problems at their departments. The two ministers blamed Conservative Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude's IT procurement policy. The Cabinet Office has said the ministers' own officials were to blame. Business Secretary Mr Cable and Energy and Climate Change Secretary Mr Davey were reported in the Financial Times to be angry about slow and intermittent emails and network problems at their departments since they started migrating to new systems in May. The problems, which included data loss, lost emails and frozen screens, are said to have nearly brought their two departments to a standstill. The departments share an IT system, which was previously provided by Japanese computer giant Fujitsu under a 15-year PFI deal worth Â£19m a year. Under new Whitehall procurement procedures, they are using several different suppliers on shorter contracts. Francis Maude is attempting to end the dominance of IT giants at Whitehall - and hand a bigger share of contracts to small and medium sized companies (SMEs). The business and climate change departments were the first to implement the new initiative - one of the Conservative Party's flagship policies to boost small business. Mr Cable is calling for it to be halted until lessons can be learned about what went wrong. But Cabinet Office sources suggested the energy and business departments had \"messed up\" the procurement of the new contracts and were trying to shift the blame to Mr Maude's team. A Conservative government source told BBC News: \"It is rather strange that the secretary of state for business seems to be against small business.\" Mr Maude's officials have pointed out that the new IT system at the two departments is not, in fact, being solely provided by small companies and some of the contractors are large IT companies. They say officials are taking time to get used to new ways of working, with several contractors handling IT instead of one big supplier. They also point out that the new IT contracts at the two departments are 40% cheaper. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"Civil servants need modern technology to do their jobs so we are replacing the expensive, inflexible and outdated contracts which we inherited in 2010. \"Our government IT reforms are saving taxpayers' money and ensuring SMEs can compete alongside bigger providers. \"Departments remain responsible for their own technology and services.\" A spokesman for the business department said they were \"working hard\" to resolve the IT problems and \"minimise disruption\" and \"much progress has now been made\". \"BIS and DECC were the first government departments to implement the  Cabinet Office's new ICT strategy and lessons learned will help other departments when they renew their IT in the future,\" the spokesman added.", "question": "A @placeholder row has erupted after Lib Dem minister Vince Cable criticised the Tories ' flagship IT policy , claiming it had nearly paralysed his department .", "option_0": "community", "option_1": "group", "option_2": "trade", "option_3": "coalition", "option_4": "communications", "label": 3}

{"article": "The Uzbek government announced his death on Friday after a period of rumours about his ill health. As is often the case with strongman regimes, no tried and tested succession mechanism is in place in Uzbekistan, and the transition of power may well be a complicated process. Uzbekistan is the most populous Central Asian country and has the largest army. Mr Karimov, who came to power during the Soviet era, has led the country since independence in 1991. During his long rule, President Karimov has built a relatively stable secular regime in a region threatened by Islamist radicalism. But many believe this has been done at the expense of human rights, and has often been an excuse to hound legitimate opposition. It also has not completely eradicated the long-term risk posed by Islamist militancy. Many Uzbek Islamists have simply dodged the tight security at home by fighting for the Islamic State group abroad, but should the secular government weaken, they might be tempted to come back. Some also say that Uzbekistan's fractured and exiled opposition may turn to Islamism to boost its appeal in the majority Muslim country. Positioned on the ancient Great Silk Road between Europe and Asia, Uzbekistan enjoys a strategic location that has attracted the interest of many foreign states throughout its long history. Most recently, it has been one reason why Russia and Western powers have been vying for a foothold. In 2001, Uzbekistan allowed the US to use its air bases in support of military action in Afghanistan, but four years later all foreign troops were evicted following Washington's criticism of the Uzbek government's human rights record. Moscow will be keen to ensure that Mr Karimov's successor leans towards Russia rather than the West. So far, unlike most Central Asian countries, Uzbekistan has been wary of Russian influence. In 2012, it withdrew from the main Russia-led regional military bloc, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. Political instability caused by Mr Karimov's demise could be felt far beyond Uzbekistan's borders. The country is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas and gold, and any turbulence may push up the price of these commodities on world markets. Tension could could also spill over into Uzbekistan's energy-rich neighbours, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Regional transport corridors may be disrupted, including gas and oil pipelines running to Russia and China. Uzbekistan also supplies electricity to Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan and southern Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan lies on key opium routes from Afghanistan to Russia and on to Europe, and drug smugglers could take advantage of instability to distract or disrupt law-enforcement efforts. President Karimov has never been shy of deploying his powerful security apparatus to exercise a firm grip on power. This, among other things, has enabled him to maintain a delicate balance between the various ethnic groups inside the country. Should it be upset, the ripple effect may be felt as far away as in China. Uzbekistan hosts a sizeable Uighur community, and the predominantly Muslim Uighur minority in China has long been seen as a source of concern by Beijing. President Karimov's successor will also inherit unresolved border differences with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

The latest juvenile batch were released in a river tributary near Builth Wells. Native crayfish numbers have been affected by non-native American signal crayfish and pollution, say officials. They have been released into specially selected \"ark\" sites on a tributary of the River Irfon after being reared at NRW's Fish Culture Unit with help from local ecology charity the Wye and Usk Foundation. The release sites are chosen for their habitat and water quality and because they are free from non-native crayfish and crayfish plague, a disease carried by the American crayfish.

{"article": "Scientists have drilled into the 200km-wide Chicxulub crater now buried under the Gulf of Mexico. They say its rocks show evidence of having been home to a large \"hydrothermal system\", where hot fluids flowed through cracks and fissures. Similar systems, generated by impacts on the early Earth, could have helped kickstart the first lifeforms. The hydrothermal system at Chicxulub may have been active for two million years or more, the scientists say. Dr David Kring, from the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, is one of the researchers who discovered and reported the crater's location. \"The impact generated a very large subsurface hydrothermal system,\" he told BBC News. \"That's exciting because we are using Chicxulub as a proxy for other, large impact events very early in Earth's history when we think these kinds of systems might have been crucibles for pre-biotic chemistry and the habitats for the evolution of the earliest life on our planet.\" About 829m of Chicxulub core material was drilled between May and June 2016. Since then, team-members have been hard at work examining rocks from the crater which was punched in the crust by a 15km-wide space object some 66 million years ago. The drilling project targeted an area called the peak ring, which contains the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact. At a briefing here at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (LPSC) in Texas, Prof Sonia Tikoo, who studies palaeomagnetism, said the cores had given scientists a lower bound for how long this hydrothermal system lasted. The direction of Earth's magnetic field flips every few hundred thousand years. When the Chicxulub extinction event occurred it had the reverse polarity to today. \"One thing that was very intriguing was that there were several samples in the breccia melt sequence that had what's now the normal polarity - the same direction as what we have today,\" the Rutgers University, New Jersey, scientist said. \"Three hundred thousand years [after the impact] the Earth's magnetic field crosses over and assumes the 'normal' polarity - it has the opposite direction [to that which existed at the time of the impact]. These rocks must have acquired their magnetisation during one of these normal polarity times that came later. Since the first of these happened 300,000 years later - that provides a lower bound constraint for the hydrothermal system, telling us how long hot fluids were going through the crater.\" The whole system may at first have been too hot for even the most heat-tolerant microorganisms. However, as time went on, the peak ring would have cooled down, allowing tiny lifeforms to exploit the chemicals dissolved in the hot fluids for fuel. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth \"With regard to the hydrothermal system, we've been able to deduce the mineralogy that the hot water fluids produced,\" said  Dr Kring. \"We're starting to track, in time, the thermal evolution: how hot the waters got and we've been able to watch how they cool down. \"Eventually, they get cool enough to support thermophilic and hyperthermophilic organisms - the same type of biota that live at volcanic hot springs. These would have lived within the fractures and the veins of this subsurface impact crater. \"We don't know how diverse this population will be. Is it two species that persists for millions of years? Or will we see an explosion of life so that we suddenly see 15 or 30 or 50 species?\" The asteroid impact killed off 75% of species on Earth, including the dinosaurs. Debris thrown into the atmosphere probably saw the skies darken and the global climate cool. It may also have triggered raging wildfires. But why this environmental cataclysm killed off some groups such as the dinosaurs, while allowing birds and mammals, for example, to survive remains unclear. \"The differential survival of animals on the planet - we don't know why birds survived and why turtles and some types of reptiles survived,\" pondered Dr Kring. \"But based on this borehole, we are going to get some limits on important parameters like energy, like trajectory - and all of that is data that will carry us towards those answers.\" The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP).

{"article": "He had been in hospital for about 10 days before his death late on Thursday. As a young man, he had fought against the Japanese during World War II, and with the French against the North Vietnamese in the 1950s. He led a 15-year CIA-sponsored secret war in Laos during the Vietnam War and, when it was lost, led tens of thousands of his people into exile. Thousands of ethnic Hmong are expected to attend his funeral in Fresno, California. \"He'll be remembered as a great general, a great warrior, a great Hmong soldier,\" his friend Charlie Waters told AFP news agency. However the response from the Laos government was muted. \"He was an ordinary person, so we do not have any reaction,\" a government spokesman was quoted by AFP as saying. Gen Pao was a controversial figure, deeply loved by many Hmong - an ethnic minority in Lao that complains of persecution - for his insistence on freedom from foreign domination. Former Central Intelligence Agency chief William Colby once called Gen Pao \"the biggest hero of the Vietnam War\". But critics say that by allying himself with the US, Gen Pao caused his people untold suffering - something that he himself recognised. \"I lost 17,000 men, almost 10% of the total Hmong population. The Hmong sacrificed the most in the war and were the ones who suffered the most,\" he said at the Heritage Foundation think tank in 1987. Americans who first came into contact with him found a man skilled in warfare and with the charisma necessary to sustain a dangerous, 15-year operation in support of the US against the North Vietnamese. The CIA airline, Air America, carried Gen Pao and his fighters across the country. Laos' forgotten Hmong On the ground, he and his men disrupted Vietnamese supply lines and engaged in pitched battles to try to stave off the Vietnamese-backed communist victory in Laos. When that effort failed in 1975, Gen Pao led many thousands of Hmong into what are now well-established exile communities in the US. The Central Valley of California, Minneapolis and cities throughout Wisconsin have a Hmong presence of an estimated 30,000-40,0000. In his later years, Gen Pao was accused of leading rebellions or sponsoring subversion against the People's Democratic Republic of Laos. In 2007, he was charged along with nine others with plotting to use AK-47 rifles, missiles and mercenaries to overthrow the Lao government. Charges against him were later dropped. He was regarded by some as an exiled head of state. \"He's the last of his kind, the last of the leadership that carries that reverence that everyone holds dear,\" said Blong Xiong, a Fresno city councilman and prominent Hmong-American. \"Whether they're young or old, they hear his name, there's the respect that goes with it.\" BBC News website readers have been sending in their reaction to the news.  Here is a selection of their comments. General Vang Pao is our greatest leader and will remain this way. He was our beacon of hope and is the very reason why we are here in the US, our land of opportunity. He will forever be missed and no one will be able to replace him in our hearts, mind and community. He was a much loved leader that led his people. He wasn't one to be above anyone, but rolled up his sleeves and challenged our everyday struggles with us. He is a great hero that - even though was considered \"exiled\" - was truly not because his people followed him to the very end. Mao Lee, Fresno, California, US I cannot believe that there can be any celebration of someone who supported the US and the CIA in Vietnam/Laos. Your note that as a Community Leader he worked as a security guard at a supermarket in the USA says it all. The US should still be damned for the horror that they exercised on Vietnamese (and US) people in the Vietnam war - and in Laos and Cambodia. Mike, Cape Town It's a tragic loss for the Hmong community. A historic Hmong leader has passed away. Neng Vang, St Paul, Minnesota, US General Vang Pao will always be regarded as the Hmong people's saviour of the war. He negotiated our freedom from what would be certain death for many of us in Laos. It is too bad that young people, like me, will never fully understand the extent of his courage, and the charismatic nature of this man. I just wished that he had done more for the young people here in the US. Maybe now that the only \"leader\" we have known is gone, maybe the Hmong community can finally understand that a divided community is not as strong as one that is unified. I certainly hope his death will cause unification and not further separation. Gregory Yang, Merced, CA, US I met Vang Pao once in the refugee camp at Loei when he and Jerry Daniels were engineering the translocation of the entire tribe to America against the wishes of Congress. The visionary leadership at that point has become, and deserves to be, legendary. He could have just joined his relatives in Missoula but he stayed and engineered the future of hundreds of thousands of his people with craft and brilliance. With Jerry dead in 1984, the Hmong people have lost the last of the pair which worked together and alone created their destiny. I feel so proud to have met a man of his stature, may he be at peace in the presence of the Lord. Dan Pride, I.C.E.M Evacuation Officer Ampur Loei As we heard the news, my parents were crying. They couldn't sleep last night and they told me that they don't know what is going to happen to the Hmong people now that General Vang Pao is gone. He has been the father figure for the Hmong people and this is going to be a very hard time for our community. Our community leaders will meet together and get this funeral done first and then we will talk about what we are going to do next. Pao, St. Paul, MN, US General Pao was the last of the Nationalist leaders from the Vietnam era. Men like him fought the Japanese and anyone else that wanted to dominate their country. We, in the US, could not tell the difference between a nationalist and a Communist. So we supported Catholics to rule a country of non-Catholics and other such stupidities. General Pao and the loyalty of his people is a good story with a semi-tragic ending in that most are far from home, the worst hell on earth for a nationalist.

{"article": "From the cornflakes box on the porch and the forlorn dog slumped at the front door, it's clear the owners left in a hurry. One of dozens of homes abandoned in the village of Petite Savanne - the reluctant centrepiece of Dominica's worst disaster in almost four decades - it's a startling testimony to the way nature can unleash its fury at a moment's notice. Tropical Storm Erika was notable less for its speed than its stealth, arriving without warning in the early hours of 27 August as islanders slept. Dumping 13 inches (33cm) of rain in 12 hours, it turned mountainsides to mush causing catastrophic landslides, and rivers into rushing overflowing torrents, claiming 34 lives and devouring 271 homes across the island. Today, as the Caribbean island battles to pick up the pieces, two government workers have flown into Petite Savanne by helicopter in an attempt to convince the handful of remaining residents of the danger they face should more rain fall. Here, the colourful sprawling homes, flanked by manicured hedges and expensive cars, are a far cry from the flimsy structures one might expect given the magnitude of the damage. It's immediately apparent that this was a prosperous place, buttressed by its location at the heart of Dominica's bay oil industry. The absence of most of its 700 residents has left it ghostly quiet - the current population of 18 doubled by the police sleeping in the village church to deter looters. The homes still standing may look sturdy enough - but the steep terrain has left them vulnerable to further landslides. Omegar Francis' girlfriend fled with the couple's two children as soon as it was safe to do so. So far he's ignored official warnings to follow. \"The last few days have been rough,\" he admits, \"but my house is far from the river so I'm not afraid.\" Phillip Darroux, 52, is also determined to stay, despite the fact all main roads in and out of the village have been destroyed, leaving Petite Savanne dependent on daily food drops by emergency helicopters. Asked what he plans to do when the supplies stop, he says: \"People don't need a lot of money here. In the old days, we lived on what we grew and drank spring water.\" Another resident, Johnson Destouche, simply says he has nowhere else to go. Officials still don't know if Petite Savanne will ever be rebuilt. For now, Dominica's focus is on re-housing the 400 islanders sleeping in shelters and paying the $220m (Â£130m) needed to fix the country's wrecked roads and bridges. Just 12 bodies have been recovered to date - a further 22 people are missing, presumed dead. Four communities are still completely cut off, and Dominica's two biggest industries - agriculture and tourism - have been pummelled by $9m and $10m losses respectively. Another $14m is needed to fix the international airport. Nonetheless, Dominicans have shown themselves to be a stoic bunch, with everyone from power plant staff to relief effort co-ordinators toiling round the clock to get the country functioning again. Debra Charles-Mark, owner of self-catering Ohlala Villas in Delices, estimates it will take three years and $400,000 to return the enterprise she describes as her \"pride and joy\" to its former glory. \"The business was just taking off; we didn't yet have the money for insurance,\" she says sadly, surveying the ruins of the smashed cottages and swimming pool. \"But we are determined to rebuild.\" Astonishment at the storm's sheer, unexpected savagery is a recurrent theme. Edward Laurent, from Mahaut, described it as the worst he's seen in his 75 years. And Gittens Anglaise, 43, of Colihaut, related tales of leaping from a window and shinnying across the water along electrical wires \"like Rambo\". His neighbour Molly John had been out celebrating her 20th wedding anniversary when the storm struck. She returned to find her home and adjoining restaurant submerged in water \"up to the doorframe\" destroying thousands of dollars worth of appliances. \"I used to cook seven days a week; now I have no income,\" she says. \"We lost everything, even my children's school uniforms.\" One of the tourism industry's biggest casualties is the Jungle Bay resort - most of its 35 luxury lodges were pulverised. Spa manager Dafrica Summers credits \"divine guidance\" with keeping all of the 43 holidaymakers there at the time safe. Tourism Minister Robert Tonge told the BBC it was \"heartbreaking\" to witness the destruction to one of Dominica's economic lynchpins, but vowed: \"It may look like all is lost but we are resilient people; we will build back up.\" He said he hoped the international airport would reopen in the next two weeks. For many, the emotional trauma may take a little longer. \"Will we ever be completely back to normal?\" Molly John adds, regarding the muddy waters with a shudder. \"I don't think so; people will always be scared of the river now.\"", "question": "Hovering uncertainly between a mangled mass of uprooted trees and a ferocious @placeholder , the little blue house is a minor rainstorm away from plunging down the mountainside into obliteration .", "option_0": "phenomenon", "option_1": "precipice", "option_2": "beach", "option_3": "heritage", "option_4": "zone", "label": 1}
{"article": "With England's 2016 fixtures completed, captain Heather Knight is heading to Australia, and another season leading Hobart Hurricanes in the Women's Big Bash League. A lot has happened in the past 12 months, and it's been a bit of a crazy year to be honest! Having taken over as England captain in June, the past five months have been some of my most enjoyable and rewarding in an England shirt. There's no doubt that it's been challenging along the way, but I'm really enjoying leading this team. As a group we feel like we've come a long way in the past year and a lot of credit has to go to our head coach Mark Robinson and assistant coach Ali Maiden for that. Alongside the England captaincy, I've also led Hobart Hurricanes, Western Storm and Berkshire in the past 12 months, so I've certainly had to manage a broad range of different people - from county players who have never played in front of a decent crowd before, to established overseas international players, and England team-mates who have won more than 100 caps. That is sometimes one of the hardest things to get right as a captain - knowing what to say and when to say it, to try to get the best out of those different characters on the pitch. It's not an exact science, but I feel like I'm learning and growing as a leader all of the time. I know that as soon as I stop trying to do that, I'll be in trouble, so I'll always be looking at ways I can get better. That's an attitude I've always had with my cricket, so I don't see why captaincy should be any different. During the second ODI against Sri Lanka earlier this month, I had a bit of a slip when I was batting and aggravated an old hamstring tendon injury, which unfortunately forced me to sit on the sidelines for the third match. Although I'm generally dreadful at watching, and always want to be involved, the girls did a brilliant job and, in my absence, they were skippered to a comfortable win by Danielle Hazell. The old hamstring injury was actually the reason I started bowling off-spin in 2014, as I was no longer able to send down my (very average) 'dibbly dobbly' seamers in the nets. So something good came out of four months on the sidelines at least! I was quite surprised to be told that, at the conclusion of the ICC Women's Championship last week, I had finished as the second highest wicket-taker in the competition. I think a lot of those wickets have probably come down to the bowlers at the other end, but I'm proud of a good couple of years with the ball all the same. I think I'll always see myself as a batter who bowls a few tweakers, but it's nice to be able to contribute to the team in another way. I'm definitely glad I decided to go down the spinner's route following my injury and with a bit of encouragement from our former spin coach Carl Crowe. After about 10 days at home, I'll be heading off to Australia for the Women's Big Bash League - along with a number of my England team-mates - and rejoining the Hobart Hurricanes. After a good season with the 'Canes last year, I'm massively excited to meet up with the team again and see what the second edition of the WBBL holds. Also, as an England team, we can now start looking forward to next summer's ICC Women's World Cup. As a player I don't think there is anything more exciting than getting the chance to play in a World Cup on home soil. I keep saying it, but it is so true, we have the best women's cricket supporters in the world, so hopefully we will get to play in front of some passionate home fans throughout the tournament next year. As a West Country girl, it's great that two of the group-stage venues - Taunton and Bristol - are in this part of the country. We are also looking forward to playing at Derby and Leicester, and with a bit of luck and some good performances, at Lord's in the final on 23 July!

{"article": "In its Cost of a Child in 2017 report, the charity says the cost of raising a child to the age of 18 for a two-parent family, excluding housing, childcare and council tax has risen to Â£75,436. A couple earning the National Living Wage falls 13% short of that, it said. Costs are up 4% compared with 2016. The figures for 2017 reflect rising prices - especially of public and private transport - but it is cuts to some welfare benefits and the failure to up-rate others that is causing the pinch to be so severe for low income families, the report says. \"For the first time in post-war history, these cost increases are not being matched by increases in support given to families from the state,\" said report author Donald Hirsch, Director of the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. He predicted the problem would become steadily worse. Two parents earning the National Living Wage of Â£7.50 an hour would fall 13% short of the income needed to provide a child with a \"no-frills living standard\", says the CPAG. The total includes food, clothing, heating as well as buying birthday presents and a week's self-catering holiday in the UK the charity said. A lone parent working full-time on the National Living Wage would fall short by 18%, according to the report. \"Families unable to cover their costs on benefits must either undergo serious hardship, fall back on the help of their families or go into debt,\" the report concludes. Child benefit and child tax credit rates have not increased since 2015 and other cuts to welfare, including the benefit cap and the limiting of child tax credit entitlement to two children per family, are affecting the income of some families. The CPAG provides an annual assessment of the cost of raising a child based on the \"minimum income standard\" or a very basic level of provision. This is determined through in-depth discussions with members of the public, asking them what it is essential for a child to have.

A BBC Newsnight investigation has heard the stories of more than 100 women who have been the target of \"revenge porn,\" but is, in fact, often premeditated. In many cases, the images are hardly pornographic. \"Soraya\" (not her real name) was just 16 when a man she met on Facebook persuaded her to send naked pictures to him online.  A sheltered British teenager of Pakistani origin, she had never had a boyfriend before. She was \"terrified\" when he threatened to send the photos to her family if she did not give him money.  She handed over Â£500. \"Sara\" married a man in an Islamic ceremony and planned to spend the rest of her life with him. He later created a website promoting her as an escort and sent it to high profile members of her local Muslim community. Both women come from families that strictly follow codes of honour and shame. Images like these can be devastating, as Shereen Aziz-Williams from the honour-based violence campaign group, The Henna Foundation, explained: \"The consequences are getting disowned, ostracised, being packed off back home to be married or, in the worst case scenario, getting killed.\" BBC Newsnight heard testimony from another South Asian woman who said she was being blackmailed by an Indian man with whom she had a relationship.  He wants a British visa and has threatened to use intimate photos of her unless she marries him. Sara told us she later discovered the man who exposed her has also done it to three other Bangladeshi women. Soraya heard her abuser also targeted other young women. Williams explained: \"It could be a girl who usually wears a scarf, who's not wearing one; or a girl showing her arms, or posing seductively fully clothed, that's deemed inappropriate.\" \"Soraya\" ended up under police protection after a friend alerted them that she was at risk of forced marriage. Although she had paid money to stop her family finding out about the photos, she believes the rumours got out anyway. She told the BBC: \"You can lose so much for your family even finding out.  It's such a risk.  I do strongly believe that the rumours did get out.  The threats were to take me back to my father's homeland, Pakistan, and get married off and stay there. \"What my dad used to threaten me by saying was, 'I'll cut up all your pieces of your body and put it in a suitcase and bury it in the garden. And I actually genuinely thought he meant it.\" Colette Paul, chief constable of the Bedfordshire Police told BBC Newsnight: \"People pick on vulnerable people because they do know the shame and dishonour they are perceived to bring is a method to control them.  Not in all cases, but some.  It's not someone who's jilted them, it's an even more serious crime. They are targeted.\" This week, the new law to combat revenge porn came into force in England and Wales. It makes it a specific offence with a potential two year jail sentence.

The pledge comes on the same day President Barack Obama is hosting leaders from the 567 federally recognised native tribes in Washington. The use of Native American mascots and symbolism in sports is at the centre of a national debate in the US. Critics say such imagery is racially offensive and it exploits native people through stereotypes. According to advocacy groups, there are approximately 2,000 schools in the US that have Native American mascots. Over the past two years around 12 have dropped the mascots and about 20 are considering a change. Should the R-word be banned? The sports company, which will have executives in attendance at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, has also said it will be among the founding members of a coalition that seeks to change Native American mascots in sports. The initiative would give schools wanting to change their mascot access to the brand's design team, who would provide logo and uniform design services. \"This remarkable stand against racism by Adidas illustrates that the issue of ending the use of the R-word is not going away, but is instead gaining momentum as people understand the damaging impacts of this racial slur,\" said Jackie Pata and Ray Halbritter, leaders with advocacy group Change the Mascot, in a written statement. The Washington Redskins, the professional American football team located in Washington, has resisted changing its name and logo despite increased criticism in recent years. \"We'll never change the name.

{"article": "If you ever saw the 58-year-old drinking in an Irish bar in his native \"Southie\", the blue collar southern part of the US city, you'd be minded not to annoy him. He looks like a tough guy who doesn't tolerate fools; you'd guess he was an off-duty policeman, fireman, or construction boss. A proud Irish American, he says this is his heritage. \"When I was growing up, every Irish guy in Boston was a contractor, a policeman, or a fireman. \"My dad was a contractor, my dad's dad was a contractor, my dad's dad's dad was a contractor.\" However, Mr McCourt didn't follow his father into the building industry for long. Instead he made his first fortune in the early 1980s as one of the first, and largest, installers of cable TV networks in the US. A serial entrepreneur, he then went on to expand into telephone systems and making television programmes. But while Mr McCourt is softly spoken and polite, the \"Southie\" steel is more than evident. \"I'm definitely not afraid of a fight [in business],\" he says. \"If I have been wronged, I will spend as long as it takes so that I feel I have been righted.\" After school in Boston, Mr McCourt went to Georgetown University in Washington DC, from where he graduated in 1979 with a degree in sociology. Moving back to Boston he worked in construction for a year or two, until aged 24 he found out that cable TV was coming to the city, and firms were being invited to bid to lay the wires in the ground. Despite having no real knowledge of the sector, Mr McCourt decided to make a pitch. Quickly doing some work in the industry so that he could learn the ropes and show he had experience, albeit brief, his bid was accepted. What gave him the edge over his rivals was that he said he could start the work straight away. While the other bidders were worried about delays in getting permits to dig up Boston's roads, Mr McCourt says that thanks to his local knowledge he had a cunning plan. He says he realised the city's then mayor was being criticised in east Boston because he had agreed to the expansion of the city's airport - located in that part of the city. So in order to help placate the local residents, Mr McCourt said he would start his work there, making them the first to get cable. It worked, and he quickly got his permits. After Boston his business - McCourt Cable Systems - expanded across the US. When problems arrived, it was invariably always a customer not paying him. Mr McCourt says he always resolved the issue with a tactic a friend taught him in a Boston bar. \"[On one occasion] my biggest customer had all my money, and all of sudden a tough guy starts taking my calls, telling me I had been charging them too much, and they were going to renegotiate my bill,\" he says. \"So I was in a pub... bitching about not getting paid, and the guy I was with grabs me by the tie and says 'do something about it, or shut up'.\" Mr McCourt says his friend then told him about a builder who, after not being paid, turned up at a customer's house with a hammer and said he would smash the wall he had built unless he got his money. \"That was my answer,\" says Mr McCourt. \"So I phoned up the company and said I'm going to start digging up all my cables. \"There was then a huge meeting with lawyers, chaos and threats, but by Thursday they had paid me everything, 100%.\" Within a few years Mr McCourt had expanded overseas, and was laying cable in Mexico, a business he subsequently sold to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. As the US telephone network was opened up to competition, he also set up a phone business called Corporate Communications Network that he merged with another business before selling for $14.3bn. He also bought a number of TV stations in the Caribbean, and moved into making TV programmes when he realised this was cheaper than buying them in. His TV career as a producer has seen him win a number of Emmy Awards, and make documentaries with the likes of Michael Douglas and Meg Ryan. Today Mr McCourt is chief executive of Granahan McCourt Capital (GMC), which has numerous business interests around the world. These range from Irish broadband business Enet to a Saudi Arabian joint partnership to develop satellite technology.

{"article": "Think soccer. Think last year's European Championship. Then tiny little Iceland were the heroes of the competition - and not just because of their wonderful fans. This team of part-timers played way above their ranking, there was solidarity, singleness of purpose, real determination. And think of England. Absurdly well paid and pampered players, whose showcase is the Premier League, the wealthiest in the world - and they were just a bunch of inked and primped individuals who seemed to have no team spirit. Dire. Just dire. And so to the G20. It is not lousy like the England team were - I mean nothing could be as bad as that. But it is less than the sum of its parts. What of the joint communiquÃ© (that will have been toiled over by bureaucratic draftsmen for days to find a bland enough form of words that all the leaders can sign up to) will be remembered in six months' time? What ringing declaration will change lives? What plan of action will we look back on and think \"turning point\"? No, I suspect this G20 will be remembered for two things. The first, the appalling violence on the streets of Hamburg from a sizeable group of protestors who seemed hellbent on burning and looting (there was something surreal on Friday night, drinking a beer in the 20th floor bar of our hotel and watching the fires and the police on the street below - as if it was a rioting son et lumiÃ¨re spectacle put on for our entertainment). And second - the first meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump. I suspect if you asked Mr Trump what was most memorable for him, he too would say the Putin meeting - but also his day in Warsaw, when thousands of Poles chanted his name and \"U-S-A\". Remember the crowd does for him what a battery station does for a Tesla car. His speech on the challenges facing the West was well crafted with an argument to make. And he just sounded - well - more committed to the idea of the \"West\" than he did when he was last in Europe at the Nato summit and the G7. His definition of what constitutes Western values may not have been to everyone's tastes - but he also committed the US to Article 5 of Nato, with its pledge that an attack on one is an attack against all. And for those countries who are part of the Alliance and abut Russia, they'll have been reassured by that. Which brings us to the meeting with the Russian leader. I've read analysis since suggesting that it was a big victory for Trump; and some arguing that Mr Putin came out of top. But that is to view the encounter as a zero sum game. Maybe both men emerged feeling they had won. Putin was treated seriously, wasn't lectured on human rights and democracy (his regular complaint about what it was like dealing with Barack Obama), and the meeting went on for nearly two hours more than its allotted time. Why does that matter? Because the Russian leader will feel he was treated as an equal to the US president with major things to discuss. Mr Trump will feel he has put the \"Russia controversy\" behind him. He raised it with Mr Putin, right, let's move on. But that might be wishful thinking. Particularly after the Russians disclosed that the American president accepted the assurances of Mr Putin that Moscow hadn't interfered in last November's election. The White House has not challenged that. And that leaves a very simple and astonishing point. Given the choice between accepting what his intelligence agencies have told him, and what Vladimir Putin has told him to be true, he's gone with the Russian. And that might not play well in Washington, where there are myriad inquiries going on into the Trump campaign's links to Russia - and a Republican Party, who by and large given the same choice over who to believe, will go for the nation's intelligence professionals. Donald J Trump might want a reset in the relationship with Russia, but there are political constraints on him in Washington. And then there are the decisions of the G20 itself. On two of the big ticket items - trade and climate change - it was really the G19 plus America. Mr Trump was intransigent in the face of appeals by other nations to recommit to the Paris climate change agreement. And there are real fears among European leaders that the president could unleash a trade war, over his insistence that America is being ripped off. So if you're marking Mr Trump's card on how he got on, it really depends on where you stand on those issues.

Despite efforts by vets, his kidneys failed and the prize winning dog had to be destroyed eight days later. Adders are the only venomous snakes in the UK and usually inactive in winter. However, it is thought the mild weather in December could have encouraged the one that bit North to come out of hibernation. Experts at Glasgow Veterinary School's small animals hospital, where North was treated, carried out tests and believe the death was probably the result of an adder bite. Ms Corsar said: \"On the morning North became ill, I had let him out into the garden as usual. \"He went along by the hedge. I never saw the snake strike, but I knew from my dog's face that something had happened and a couple of hours later a swelling appeared on the back of his leg and hough.\" North was treated at the Bruceview Veterinary Clinic in Stirling, before being transferred to Glasgow Vet School on 27 December. \"Unfortunately, his kidneys failed and everything started to shut down and he had to be put to sleep,\" Ms Corsar said. \"I was distraught. He was a champion dog and had won awards all over the country and at some of the top dog shows.\" The 59-year-old pet owner said that she was frightened to let her other dogs off the lead in the garden in case the snake was still there. She has contacted the council and Scottish SPCA about the incident. \"I was absolutely gutted. North will always be in my heart,\" she added. David Paterson, practice principal at Bruceview and the first vet to see North, described the dog's initial symptoms as \"nondescript\". He said: \"We provided treatment and the dog seemed to improve over the next 24 hours but two days later he started to go downhill, his leg became more swollen. \"He required emergency treatment and was taken to the Glasgow University Vet School. They worked very hard and conducted tests and their tentative diagnosis was an adder bite.\" Mr Paterson said dogs generally recovered from adder bites, and added: \"I have been in practice here for 25 years and in that time I cannot remember an adder bite diagnosis coming from Stirling city itself.\" A spokesman for the SSPCA said pest control was the responsibility of Stirling Council, but the council said adders were protected and it would be an offence to disturb or capture them without a licence. Gary Powell from the Amphibian and Reptile Conservation Trust said: \"Adders tend to shuttle in and out of hibernation anyway.

{"article": "He said she told him to \"go harder,\" a phrase similar to what Mr Evans claims she used with him in a hotel room. The Chesterfield striker denies raping a 19-year-old at a Premier Inn in Rhuddlan, Denbighshire, on 30 May 2011. Mr Evans, 27, was found guilty of rape at Caernarfon Crown Court in 2012, but his conviction was quashed in April. The former Manchester City and Sheffield United player denies having sex with the woman while she was too drunk to consent. He insists she agreed to let him \"join in\" while she was having consensual sex with fellow footballer Clayton McDonald, 27, after a night out in Rhyl. A man who said he slept with the complainant multiple times in the months leading up to the alleged offence said he picked her up after a night out on 28 May 2011 and described her as being drunk when he took her home. The man - who cannot be named - said she \"came on to\" him in bed, saying: \"Are you not even going to rip my clothes off?\" \"I was quite shocked,\" he said. \"At the beginning I was a little bit nervous. The relationship we had was purely based on sex. \"I was very shocked with the words - she was expecting sex to happen as soon as we got into the house.\" He said the complainant \"dictated\" how the sex occurred and told him to \"go harder\". \"She was a lot more confident. There had been a break between that time and the previous that I had slept with her, so I was a bit shocked to how much more confident she was,\" he added. Prosecutor Simon Medland QC asked why he never mentioned the phrase \"go harder\" in his initial statement in September 2011 but did in a statement in December 2015. He said he was not asked for details in the first interview and did not feel comfortable discussing it in that way over the phone. The second interview was in person, and he was \"made to feel at ease\" and asked for more details, he added. Mr Medland asked the witness if he was aware of a Â£50,000 reward offered for any information that might lead to Mr Evans' acquittal before he gave evidence at the footballer's appeal. \"No,\" he replied, saying he would have a \"lot more to lose than to gain\" if he had given evidence for money as he would most likely lose his well-paid job. \"The money I could get paid in the next 20 years outweighs a small lump sum,\" he said.

{"article": "Iran and Kuwait are the most affected countries, largely because of sand and dust blowing in from Syria and Iraq. Mismanagement of land and water amid conflicts in the region has been a key factor, as well as climate change. Meteorologists say sand and dust storms are also happening in new places like some parts of Central Asia. \"In the Middle East there has been a significant increase in the frequency and the intensity of sand and dust storms in the past 15 years or so,\" said Enric Terradellas a meteorologist with the World Meteorology Organisation's sand and dust storm prediction centre for the region. \"One of the main sources of sand and dust storms is Iraq, where the flow of rivers has decreased because of a race in dam constructions in upstream countries. \"That has led to the disappearance of marshes and drying up of lakes both in Iraq and Iran, and the sediments left behind are very important sources of dust in the region.\" Deserts have always been the source of sand storms in the region, but scientists say unsustainable mining, oil extraction and agriculture as well as intensive military conflicts are worsening the situation. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has predicted that Iraq could witness 300 dust events in a year within 10 years, up from around 120 per year now. Iranian health department officials have said 14 provinces are affected today by dust storms, including Tehran. \"The air is so polluted here and I have developed breathing problem,\" Jasem, a businessman in Ahvaz in southwest Iran told the BBC, coughing over the phone. \"Coughing is usual thing for me now and we need to keep the windows closed and use the air-conditioner all the time.\" Iman, a university lecturer in south-eastern Iran, said going out was becoming increasingly difficult. \"We can feel the sand coming in from the west of the country and we don't let our kids play outside the house.\" Scientists said data from Syria was not easily available, but that there were enough grounds to believe that it is another major source of sand and dust. \"People aren't tending the land in agricultural areas appropriately - which means planting crops and tending them in a way that is sustainable - because they are off either being refugees or involved in the fighting,\" said Nick Middleton of St Anne's College, Oxford, one of the reviewers of the UN study. \"So the former agricultural areas, I suspect, are more active as wind erosion sources now.\" Meteorologists say some parts of Central Asia are also experiencing the storms. \"The Aral Sea is drying up and the dust problem is also increasing in Kazakhstan and Mongolia, for instance,\" said Alexander Baklanov, another sand and dust storm expert with the World Meteorology Organisation. The dust and sand from Mongolia and the Gobi desert reach China, the Korean peninsula and Japan, where they have caused major health concerns. Storms from the Sahara desert are also believed to be spreading lethal meningitis spores throughout central Africa. \"A dust storm consists of massive amount of particulates in the air and when people breathe it, these can get down their lungs and cause respiratory illness and heart disease and so on,\" said Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, a health and climate change expert with the World Health Organisation.

{"article": "Elizabeth Denham announced the review amid concerns over allegations involving an analytics firm linked to a Brexit campaign. It follows calls for an investigation into claims that Leave.EU had not declared the role of Cambridge Analytica (CA) in its campaign. The Electoral Commission says its powers do not extend beyond the UK. But Ms Denham said: \"Having considered the evidence we have already gathered, I have decided to open a formal investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes. \"This will involve deepening our current activity to explore practices deployed during the UK's EU referendum campaign, but potentially also in other campaigns.\" The probe was sparked by Labour's Stephen Kinnock, a remain campaigner, who called on the Electoral Commission to look into links between Leave.EU and CA. Claire Bassett, the commission's chief executive, said, while it had \"very clear rules\" governing the permissibility of donations and printed materials, such as campaign leaflets, it has no power to stop overseas individuals or governments using social media to influence British elections. \"At the moment the rules apply to print media - so if you get a leaflet through your door, that should have an imprint on it which makes it clear who's produced that leaflet and where it's come from so you know who's campaigning for your vote,\" she said. \"At the moment those rules don't extend to social media and we've recommended that that should happen.\" But quizzed about how far the electoral watchdog could go to prevent individuals or governments attempting to influence British elections via data analytic companies which target voters, Ms Bassett said: \"If something is happening outside of the borders of this country and is not part of any of the regime we're responsible for, it's not something we can cover within our regulation.\" Ms Denham said it was \"understandable\" that \"political campaigns are exploring the potential of advanced data analysis tools to help win votes\", but said the \"public have the right to expect that this takes place in accordance with the law\". \"This is a complex and rapidly evolving area of activity and the level of awareness among the public about how data analytics works, and how their personal data is collected, shared and used through such tools is low,\" she said. \"What is clear is that these tools have a significant potential impact on individuals' privacy. \"It is important that there is a greater and genuine transparency about the use of such techniques to ensure that people have control over their own data and the law is upheld.\" Ms Denham said the investigation was a \"high priority for her team\" and that she was \"conscious\" that it coincides with the general election campaign. The probe follows an Observer investigation suggesting there were links between data analytics firms, a US billionaire and the Leave campaign in last year's EU referendum. A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said the firm was happy to help the watchdog with any inquiry into the use of data analytics in politics but that it had had \"no involvement\" in the EU referendum. The Electoral Commission found the Tories spent £1.2m on Facebook campaigns during the 2015 election - more than seven times the £160,000 spent by Labour. The Liberal Democrats spent just over £22,000. Leave campaigners spent £3.5m with a technology company called Aggregate IQ. Vote Leave said it allowed them to target swing voters online much more effectively and efficiently. But BBC media editor Amol Rajan said that while huge amounts of money were being spent by political parties online, not everyone was \"transparent about their ambitions online\". \"We know that millions and millions of pounds have been spent by various people - foreign forces, sometimes extremists - who are politically advertising online trying to influence elections and they are not regulated,\" he said. \"The fact is the technology is changing very fast but the law hasn't kept pace. \"When it comes to broadcast advertising, we tend to know who's advertising, how much money they are spending and they tend to do it within certain social norms, but when it comes to political advertising online, it's very unclear who is spending the money and to what end.... \"The point is we simply don't have clear regulations that require people to be transparent. The implication is that they might be foreign forces; they might be very wealthy individuals who are having a material impact on elections in western or non-Western democracies and we simply don't know about it. \"It seems pretty obvious if we regulate political advertising in other spheres we need to think very hard about the impact of political advertising online too.\"", "question": "A probe into the political use of private data has been opened by the @placeholder commissioner .", "option_0": "force", "option_1": "equalities", "option_2": "water", "option_3": "community", "option_4": "information", "label": 4}
{"article": "On 9 September, the 45th anniversary of a bloody 1971 prison uprising in Attica, New York, inmates at prisons throughout the US staged a coordinated strike in an estimated 11 states. The epicentre of the protest movement is the troubled William C Holman Correctional Facility in Alabama and a group of inmates and allies there called the Free Alabama Movement. Fam partnered with the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee to spread the word to various prisons through direct mailings and prisoner news publications. Inmates have even found ways to communicate about the strike using social media accounts, which can be maintained by friends and family on the outside. \"That's very difficult to organise, and this is, even taking the most conservative version of the facts, the largest prisoner strike in recent memory,\" says David Fathi, director of the ACLU National Prison Project. The goals were manifold, but among them is an end to cheap prison labour. In the US, prison inmates do all sorts of work, from fighting fires, to sewing undergarments, to farming the land and cleaning up road kill on the highways. For these kinds of duties they can be paid as little as 15 cents an hour. While private companies do contract with prisons for cheap labour, Alex Friedmann, the managing editor of Prison Legal News, says the vast majority of the work is to help run and maintain the prison facilities themselves. \"Prisons really work off the back of prisoners,\" he says, noting that inmates do not receive minimum wage, worker's compensation or overtime and cannot unionise. Most of their money ends up spent at the prison's commissary or to use the phones. \"They cannot run these facilities without us,\" reads one piece of organising literature. \"We hope to end prison slavery by making it impossible, by refusing to be slaves any longer.\" The strike has an interesting end goal, according to the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee - by raising prison wages, costs for the institutions will go up and the profitability of contracting out prison labour will go down, eliminating any profit-making incentives for incarceration. Prison reform has been a huge topic of conversation in the US for some time. The federal government just announced that it will end its use of private, for-profit prisons. Several state governments have elected to either scale back or at least study their use of solitary confinement. The Federal Communications Commission began capping the rates that prisoners have to pay to call the outside world - rates that previously could be as high as $1 a minute. But with the advent of this strike, it appears that inmates are hoping to capitalise on the groundswell of support for reform and aren't willing to wait until they're free to do so. On the appointed day of the strike, reports of protesting inmates trickled out from around the country. In a facility in Florida, 400 inmates reportedly damaged their dorms, though no one was injured. At the Holman facility in Alabama, 45 inmates stayed in their cells rather than report to work. In a Michigan prison, hundreds of inmates initially refused to work and staged a march, which later turned into the destruction of some of the dorms, according to officials. As the weeks have rolled on, other reports have come in of inmates on hunger strikes. Estimates of how many prisons were affected vary - advocates say 20 prisons had a total of 20,000 inmates participating at one time. Covering the actions is inherently difficult, however, given that they occur behind locked doors, away from public view, and the strikers themselves have limited (or no) access to phones and the internet. On top of that, officials may have an incentive to downplay what is happening at their facilities. According to the Marshall Project, a non-profit news website concerned with criminal justice reform in the US, despite reports of striking inmates in facilities in Texas and South Carolina, prison authorities have denied any action took place. Some inmates have gotten news out of their facilities using contraband mobile phones, but these reports are, again, difficult to confirm. Nevertheless, there has been one notable and confirmable development at Holman, which has long struggled with violence, overcrowding, understaffing and rioting. Before the strike began, an inmate fatally stabbed a guard in the head with a makeshift knife. The prison is on its third warden in nine months - the previous one retired after being stabbed. On 24 September, nine correctional officers did not arrive for their shift. Advocates say that this was in solidarity with the inmates, and in the past Holman guards have made complaints similar to those of the inmates - that Holman is incredibly unsafe due to understaffing and lack of resources. A Holman inmate called Kinetik Justice - who has been communicating via Twitter - says further actions by the guards is coming. \"I think this is a wake up call,\" says Fathi. \"This is a very costly action for prisoners - they can be disciplined ... They can be put in solitary confinement, they can lose good time, thus prolonging their time in prison. \"That says to me they are at the limits of their tolerance.\"", "question": "The US is currently in the midst of the largest prisoner strike in its history .

{"article": "The acclaimed Scots painter Alexander Goudie was bewitched by witches, says his son and fellow artist Lachlan Goudie in a new BBC programme. The figure that interested him the most was Nannie in Robert Burns' poem Tam o' Shanter and, for the last 20 years of his life, Alexander Goudie told The Bard's chilling tale in pictures. But Lachlan also tells of his father recounting stories of Isobel Gowdie. Writing for the BBC, the artist said: \"My father's penchant for the spectral may have had its origins in our own family bloodline. \"He relished telling his boggle-eyed children that in 1662 the 'last witch burned at the stake in Scotland', Isobel Gowdie shared our surname.\" Alexander Goudie was not alone in being drawn to the story of the 17th Century witch, who is believed to have witnessed a bloody battle and years later told an elaborate fib about dealings with the devil and fairies in the hope of saving herself from torture and a violent death. Her witch trial inspired Ayrshire-born composer James MacMillan to write The Confession of Isobel Gowdie in 1990. He has described the music, a commission for the Proms, as the big breakthrough in his career. The 1662 trial is also explored in a book by academic Emma Wilby. The book, The Visions of Isobel Gowdie: Magic, Witchcraft and Dark Shamanism in Seventeenth-Century Scotland, was shortlisted for the Saltire Society Scottish History Book of the Year 2010. On the internet, there are websites dedicated to her. The site Witchvox says Gowdie was \"stunningly beautiful, with flaming red hair\" - a description that could be applied to the Nannie in some of Goudie's Tam o' Shanter paintings. Gowdie grew up in Auldearn, near Nairn. When she was a girl she is thought to have witnessed 1645's Battle of Auldearn. The clash marked a major victory for Scottish Royalists over Covenanter army, and local legend tells of some of the casualties being buried nearby in a place still known today as Dead Man's Wood. A dovecot now stands at the site of the battle. In 1662, Gowdie was suspected of witchcraft and over the course of a six-week trial she gave a vivid and detailed account of making a pact with the devil. She also told of being part of a witches coven, that she shot arrows made by elves and had feasted with the king and queen of fairies. It has been suggested that she made up the stories, telling the trial what it wanted to hear, to spare herself from a more violent interrogation. Promoting the publication of her book, academic Emma Wilby said: \"My research suggests that Isobel's confessions contain so much vividly-described folkloric detail because she was an oral performer or village bard, while her interrogators, for their part, were particularly curious and attentive. \"As a result, her interrogation sessions were unusually creative.\" The devil is said to have foretold Gowdie that a farm at nearby Culbin would be smothered by sand. Interestingly, sandstorms do occasionally blow up from time to time on that part of the Moray Firth coast. In 1694, a sandstorm raged at Culbin, burying homes and ruining an estate. Marram grass that had kept the long and wide stretch of sands from shifting had previously been ripped up for thatching roofs and as fuel for heating. Brian Fagan in his book The Little Ice Age: How Climate Made History 1300-1850 wrote of the local laird becoming a pauper in a matter of hours and appealing to the Scottish Parliament for tax relief. And John Martin, of Elgin, wrote of the storm at the time: \"The wind comes rushing down through the openings between the hills, carrying with it immense torrents of sand, with a force and violence almost overpowering. \"Clouds of dust are raised from the tops of the mounds and are whirled about in the wildest confusion and fall with the force of hail. \"Nothing can be seen but sand above, sand below and sand everywhere. You dare not open your eyes but must grope your way about as if blindfolded.\" Earlier this year, sandy soil was blown off fields and coated the interiors of buildings in Nairn. Following her trial, Gowdie is believed to have been strangled and then burned at the stake. James MacMillan has said that his music sought to offer her the \"mercy and humanity\" that she was denied in the final weeks of her life. And as Lachlan Goudie has shown, her name lives on more than 350 years after her execution.", "question": "One of Scotland 's most famous alleged witches continues to be a @placeholder for artists .

Mortgages Loans Inter-bank lending Indicator of trust Reflects health of banks Banks don't just lend money to one another whenever they like. There is a system. Every day a group of leading banks submits the interest rates at which they are willing to lend to other finance houses. They suggest rates in 10 currencies covering 15 different lengths of loan, ranging from overnight to 12 months. The most important rate is the three-month dollar Libor. The rates submitted are what the banks estimate they would pay other banks to borrow dollars for three months if they borrowed money on the day the rate is being set. Then an average is calculated. This is a simple example of how it works. Since the rates submitted are estimates, not actual transactions, it has been suggested that banks could have submitted false figures.  It is alleged that traders at several banks conspired to influence the final average rate that results, the official Libor rate, by agreeing amongst themselves to submit rates that were either higher or lower than their actual estimates.

{"article": "The Briton produced a stunning lap to be 0.360 seconds quicker than Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg - and seemed as if he may have been able to go faster. But the track was empty for the final five minutes and senior figures said the format should be rethought. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said F1 should \"apologise to the fans\". \"It didn't really work for me,\" Horner added. \"We have not really put on a show. \"To have Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen in fast cars not taking part with five minutes to go is wrong.\" Rosberg was behind both Ferraris after the first runs in the final session, but he grabbed second on his final run ahead of Vettel and Raikkonen, who will start third and fourth respectively. The first race of the new season gets under way on Sunday at 05:00 GMT, with coverage on radio 5 live from 04:00 and online from 03:30. Rosberg said straight after the session: \"It's good to try something but it hasn't worked - so we should go back.\" Ferrari's Vettel, who qualified third but was able to change out of his overalls in time for the post-qualifying news conference because he did not run in the second part of the final session, said: \"I don't see why everyone is surprised it didn't work. \"It is a bit busier at the beginning of the session but for no reason. People want to see us pushing to the limit at the end of the session. It is the wrong way to go and that's what we said.\" The new format did work on one level, however. It made the first and second parts of the session more fraught - and one top team was caught out as Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat ended up 18th on the grid. Media playback is not supported on this device Hamilton was 0.838secs quicker than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who was also 0.478secs behind Rosberg. The margin between the cars was such that Ferrari decided not to bother doing a second run in the final session of qualifying because they accepted they could not beat the Mercedes and preferred to save a set of tyres for the race. On the face of it, that suggests Mercedes are as far ahead of Ferrari as they were last year. But Hamilton was actually even further ahead of Vettel in qualifying in Australia last year and the German won the next race in Malaysia. Hamilton said: \"I really have to take my hat off to this team - what they have done to raise the bar once more. It inspires and motivates me. \"I enjoyed driving the car in qualifying, got the set-up just right. They were some sexy laps, beautiful rhythm, it felt so good.

{"article": "And maybe a good percentage will already have given up and decided that maybe the following year will be the time to finally write that bestselling novel. But why do we keep putting things off? Why is procrastination such a common problem? It's claimed as a particular difficulty for students and academics. Professor Tim Pychyl, a psychologist at Carleton University in Canada, is part of the Procrastination Research Group and calls it \"the biggest problem in education today\". A lecture in which he gives advice to students on how to stop procrastinating recently passed 170,000 views on YouTube. Procrastination, it's claimed, can affect student grades, drop-out rates and mental and physical health. Lecturers suffer from procrastination too, with academic Twitter feeds talking about \"writing guilt\" and the battle between marking papers and watching Netflix. With more people studying online, procrastination is a greater problem than ever before. At only the click of a button, an essay can be replaced by a video of a sneezing kitten, or a Facebook photo album of your ex and her new boyfriend on holiday. Prof Pychyl says procrastination is making the choice to avoid doing something, even though we know this will cost us in the long run. More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch. You can join the debate at the BBC's Family & Education News Facebook page. He says it is different from intentionally delaying doing something, and it is not a problem of time management, but a failure to control our emotions. \"When we procrastinate, we are trying to improve our mood by avoiding doing something that feels unpleasant to us,\" he says. \"A bit like getting drunk or comfort eating, it is a coping strategy to feel better by distracting ourselves with short-term pleasure and forgetting about a problem.\" Procrastination is more common among people who are impulsive, prone to perfectionism, burdened by other people's expectations of them, and scared of failure. It affects younger people in particular, because we get better at controlling our emotions as our brain develops. But there is hope for procrastinators. Based on his research with Dr Fuchsia Sirois of the University of Sheffield, Prof Pychyl insists that anyone can reduce procrastination with the following steps: 1) Practice techniques of mindfulness and meditation to gain control over negative thoughts. \"Using mindfulness techniques, we can acknowledge that we do not feel like doing something without making a judgement on this feeling, then remind ourselves why the task is important, and commit to making a start,\" says Prof Pychyl. \"And when we make progress on a task, we feel better about ourselves and this makes it much easier to carry on.\" Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham, has introduced mindfulness sessions for staff and students. 2) Break down a task into clear and manageable steps. One reason for procrastination is that the targets we set are often too big and vague, which makes them seem more intimidating and unpleasant. So you should scale down your new year's resolutions from \"get in shape\" or \"write a novel\" to \"put on your running gear\" or \"find a name for your main character\". At the University of Warwick's Warwick Manufacturing Group, Paul Roberts runs mind-mapping workshops for students. This technique helps them to break down large tasks so that they can see what steps they will need to take to complete their projects. He says this helps them to overcome the inertia of starting, and procrastination drops as a result. 3) Don't punish yourself for procrastinating. Prof Pychyl's research shows that students who forgive themselves for procrastinating are less likely to delay in the same way on their next assignment. So the more guilt and anger you feel about depriving the world of your groundbreaking novel this year, the less chance you have of writing it next year. 4) Build on the good habits you already have. Prof Pychyl says he finally managed to obey his dentist's instruction to floss by combining it with his existing habit of brushing his teeth. He committed himself to placing the floss on the counter in front of him every time he brushed his teeth, and flossing soon became second nature to him. 5) Get in touch with your \"future self\". When people were shown a digitally-aged picture of themselves and then asked to allocate money, they were more likely to save for retirement because they felt a stronger association with their future selves. Putting a digitally-aged self-portrait by your desk might prompt your colleagues to look at you strangely or even accuse you of time travel. But if your deadline is 9am, then simply imagining yourself desperately writing the essay at 2am might persuade you to start earlier. 6) Work out why you care about what you are doing. Prof Pychyl says procrastination can often reflect a deeper existential problem of lacking an identity or a direction in life. We procrastinate on tasks that we see as boring or less meaningful. So remind yourself why you are doing something and how it fits in with your ambitions. Perhaps writing a good essay will help you get a good degree, which will help you pursue your dream of being a doctor. By thinking in this way, the long-term benefit of doing your work can overpower the short-term pleasure of distractions. If these research-backed steps are so effective, should they be taught in every school, university and workplace? Many universities, such as UEA, Goldsmiths and Bradford, produce guides on procrastination for students. But Prof Pychyl says much advice still focuses on time management skills, rather than tackling the root causes. \"Professors should address how students are feeling throughout the term and help them to understand why they procrastinate,\" he says. \"If they can learn to manage their emotions, it will help them in every area of their lives.\"", "question": "In these first days of the new year , @placeholder of us will have embarked on a resolution for 2017 .", "option_0": "state", "option_1": "consisting", "option_2": "generation", "option_3": "series", "option_4": "millions", "label": 4}

Dozens of other families have also been told their loved ones' body parts were kept by the force. GMP said whether or not to contact the affected families was a decision it \"agonised over for a number of months\". Mr Culshaw, 26, was stabbed to death in Wigan in 1993. His family buried him believing his body was intact, and were unaware his stomach, liver and other tissues had been retained after two post-mortem examinations until police officers visited them in September last year. His mother, Jennifer Shaw, said she wanted to know why it had taken so long to come to light. \"He's my son. And he's been left - half of him,\" she said. \"If he'd have died and they'd asked me if they could use the parts to help somebody, then yes. But just to be sat in a lab for 23 years doing nothing, that's just horrendous.\" The body parts were discovered following an audit of the former Forensic Science Service in 2014, the Manchester Evening News revealed. It found more than 180 samples - including major organs - from victims of crime in Greater Manchester were being held for the police force, which has admitted there could be more body parts unaccounted for. It became illegal in 2006 to remove or store human tissue without families' consent following an investigation at Liverpool's Alder Hey hospital in 1999. Organs from hundreds of babies who died at the hospital were secretly taken. The body parts kept for Greater Manchester Police were removed before that date.

{"article": "On Thursday, two satellites will launch from French Guiana to begin the process of rolling out Galileo - Europe's multi-billion-euro version of the American Global Positioning System (GPS). If that were not significant enough, the spacecraft will ride to orbit on the first Russian Soyuz rocket to operate from Western territory. I'll talk more of Galileo later in the week, but I want to concentrate on Soyuz for this posting. Formally initiated by European space ministers in 2003, the new Soyuz launch complex has been constructed at Europe's spaceport - the Guiana Space Centre (CSG - Centre Spatial Guyanais). It is inside the Sinnamary commune about 15km up the coast from the Kourou commune where the pad was built for Europe's heavy-lift workhorse, the Ariane 5 rocket. Engineers have cleared an area of jungle to build a 120ha, near-facsimile of the Soyuz facilities used through the decades at Baikonur, in Kazakhstan, and Plesetsk, in northern Russia. Those familiar with TV pictures of Baikonur will instantly recognise the giant flame bowl that deflects the exhaust gases and noise away from the rocket as it begins its ascent. Having stood in the new bowl a couple of times myself, I can attest to its immense scale - 250,000 cubic metres of rock and earth had to be dug out of the ground to make it. Present also is a 700m-long railway to take the rocket from its integration building, the MIK, to the pad, where, just as in Baikonur and Plesetsk, the four-stage vehicle is raised into the vertical position ready for its mission. Bright yellow and blue support towers hold the rocket in place. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" they say, and the purpose of all this deja vu is to ensure the new Sinnamary home of Soyuz stays as true as possible to a very successful launch heritage. There are differences, of course - some a little less obvious to the casual eye. The Soyuz-ST, the vehicle that will be used in French Guiana, has a bigger clam-shell fairing enclosing its satellites - 4.11m in diameter compared to 3m on a \"classical\" Soyuz. It's also got a digital flight control system and a modified upper stage. But these \"evolutions\" have all been tested in launches from Baikonur already, and so cannot really be described as \"new\" for Thursday. Another \"under the skin\" change concerns the method used to terminate a flight if it goes wrong. Back in Kazakhstan or Russia, the detection of an anomaly results in an automatic engine shutdown. With no power, the rocket simply falls from the sky and is destroyed when it hits the ground. \"In French Guiana, this will be same - plus, we will have the capacity to telecommand to stop the engine,\" explained Jean-Marc Astorg, from the French space agency (Cnes), who has led the Soyuz in French Guiana project. \"So, there will be a Cnes officer who will be following the flight, and if the trajectory is not nominal - he will push a button. It's an additional safety measure.\" Perhaps the most noticeable difference in operation is the 52m-tall mobile gantry, which will be used to install the satellites on top of the rocket. In Baikonur and Plesetsk, the satellites are always attached to the Soyuz while the rocket is still in the horizontal. But the spacecraft preparation facilities at the CSG are set up to do it in the vertical, and so the new gantry has been developed to fit with European custom and practice. \"It also means that if we wanted to change a payload from a Soyuz to an Ariane 5, or from an Ariane 5 to a Soyuz - that would be easy. And we need the gantry for environmental reasons. There are heavy rains in French Guiana, mosquitoes even - so it is better to protect the people working there.\" However, getting the gantry built in Russia, shipped to French Guiana, and then assembled and running smoothly on its bogeys, proved quite a struggle. This one item alone added over a year to the project timeline and significantly increased its final cost. Basing Soyuz in French Guiana should give the rocket a new lease of life. By launching closer to the equator, the rocket receives a bigger boost from the Earth's rotation, meaning it can lift nearly double the mass of a normal Baikonur payload - a maximum of three tonnes, as opposed to 1.7 tonnes, into a geosynchronous orbit 36,000km above the Earth. And the \"European Soyuz\" should be a fillip for Arianespace, the company set up to market and operate the Ariane rockets. With a new small vehicle called Vega also set to debut early next year, Arianespace will soon offer the full portfolio of launch services from CSG. Ariane will put in orbit the really big telecommunications satellites, Soyuz will loft the medium-class spacecraft, and Vega will take care of the compact scientific payloads. \"The talks about Soyuz in French Guiana started in the late 90s when we began the co-operation with Soyuz at Baikonur with [our subsidiary] Starsem, and in parallel there was - I would say - an opinion shared in Russia and Europe that it could be interesting to build a Soyuz launch pad in French Guiana,\" Jean-Yves Le Gall, the chairman and CEO of Arianespace, told me. \"For the Russians, the advantage is obvious - to have more launches and so to produce more launch vehicles. And for the Europeans, it was clear that the Ariane 5 would become bigger and bigger, and so we needed a mid-class launch vehicle. \"Developing a mid-class launch vehicle in Europe would have cost between three and five billion euros, and building the Soyuz launch pad has been just - if I can say 'just' - around 400 million euros,\" he explained. \"The other benefit is that we are able to launch from French territory some satellites with classified components that cannot be sent to Russia or Kazakhstan - for instance, Galileo. For Galileo, we are obliged to launch from French territory.\" At the moment, Soyuz is used at Baikonur to launch astronauts to the International Space Station. No-one is talking about human missions for CSG yet, but the space in the jungle is there to build the additional facilities if that option is ever taken up. UPDATE (09/11/2011):  I should add that before a Soyuz manned mission could ever fly from Sinnamary, considerable modifications would need to be made to its TMA capsule, which was designed to come back on land. A French Guiana launch would necessitate a contingency for an abort over the ocean, and getting the crew out of an unmodified capsule in water would be precarious to say the least.", "question": "It is one of the most important weeks in the history of European space @placeholder .", "option_0": "history", "option_1": "moods", "option_2": "life", "option_3": "tents", "option_4": "activity", "label": 4}

The Chinese conglomerate now employs more than 400,000 people worldwide and has ambitions to grow even more. HNA chief executive Adam Tan told the BBC it had \"full confidence\" in its approach, despite threats of tighter spending controls on Chinese businesses and the prospect of Brexit in the UK. The company's strategy involves buying businesses all along the supply chain. That means when you travel, for example, your luggage might be handled by one of its firms, you could eat aeroplane food from its catering group Gate Gourmet, or stay in one of its hotels. \"That's our business, from the airlines business, airport business, shopping business and travel agent business,\" Mr Tan says. As well as the travel industry, HNA also has a sprawling property portfolio. One of its major deals last year was to acquire two large buildings in London's Canary Wharf. That deal was shortly before the Brexit vote, but Mr Tan says he continues to see strengths in the UK economy. \"Before I bought the two buildings in Canary Wharf, we had full confidence in London and the UK. \"I've still got huge confidence.

For that reason, he is sanguine about plans by Beijing to tighten restrictions on Chinese businesses spending money abroad.

{"article": "Yet while such a prospect would make most of us run a mile, this is in fact a traditional massage method in Russia. Called a \"venik\" massage, the oak bunches are first softened in warm water. And rather than being whacked on your back in anger, they are gently and rhythmically applied. It is a popular treatment in the thousands of steam bathhouses, or \"banyas\", across Russia. The massage, which takes place in a sauna room set at a temperature of 70C, is said to boost circulation and prevent premature ageing of the skin. And after the treatment has finished you are supposed to immediately jump into a plunge pool of cold water. You might think that such an unusual massage would struggle to be successfully exported from Russia, but the co-founder of the first banya in London says that two years after opening, almost half of its customers are non-Russians. Launching the banya, called Banya No.1, was the dream of entrepreneurial Russian ex-pat Ksenia Bobkova. The 37-year-old has lived in the UK for more than 20 years after moving from St Petersburg to study law at Edinburgh University in 1994. After graduating from Edinburgh she has had a successful career in finance in London, first working at a large commercial law firm, and then co-founding a new investment company. Yet as much as Ms Bobkova says she has always enjoyed living in the UK, the one thing she really missed was regular trips to a banya. After dreaming of opening London's first banya for more than a decade, Ms Bobkova says that in 2012 \"the circumstances came together\" to enable her to finally start work on it. Firstly, she realised that more and more Russians were now living in London, which she hoped would make a banya commercially viable, and she had built up enough savings to launch the business. Then she found the right building, and two other UK-based Russian investors came on board. After a year of construction work, including importing a traditional banya stove from Russia, the bathhouse opened its doors in 2013. \"When we wrote the business plan, we certainly focused on the fact that the Russian-speaking community in London had grown substantially over the past 15 years,\" she says. \"But after we opened we soon discovered that London is so international, and that people who live here are so open to new experiences, that almost half our customers are non-Russian.\" Customers - both male and female - who don't want to strip naked can instead wear their swimming costume, or a strategically placed towel. And for people who wish to avoid the oak leaves, Scandinavian-style, hands-based back massages are also available. After the massages, people are encouraged to stay and relax in a lounge or rest area, where they can order traditional Russian food. While Ms Bobkova is reluctant to discuss how financially successful the banya is, it is often full, and typical visits cost Â£100 per person. And she now plans to open more branches. Running the banya is a world apart from Ms Bobkova's main job of helping to lead investment firm Fusion Asset Management, of which she was a founding partner in 2004. The business invests millions of pounds globally on behalf of large institutions, and has a sister office in Moscow. While the original six founders included one Englishman, an American and a Frenchman, it is now owned and run by three London-based Russian ex-pats. Ms Bobkova says that she likes working in the UK, because she values what she describes as \"British fair play\" in business. \"Without comparing specifically to Russia, what is very fundamental in British business ethics is this concept of fair play,\" she says. \"[Doing business in the UK means] you can trust people, and people will generally not try to squeeze you too much. In the UK both sides get a fairly allocated share of the profit, rather than one gets all, and the other gets nothing.\" In terms of her day-to-day style as a boss she says that while she has high expectations of staff, it is a point of principle that the 20 people at the finance firm don't have to work late nights or at weekends. \"Nothing in the world is so important that it needs to be done at the weekend,\" she says. In addition to the two businesses, Ms Bobkova is also a co-founder of a networking organisation for Russians living and working in London. Called Russians in the City, and with 2,300 members, it holds quarterly events, such as drinks parties, or polo matches and skiing trips. The world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015? A Richer World 2015 Listen to the reports and documentaries The organisation has since opened a sister branch in Switzerland, with other ones due to open in New York and Dubai. A UK passport holder, and previously married to a British husband, Ms Bobkova says that Russians in the City allow her to maintain the Russian side of her identity. \"I'm British in that I have lived here for 20 years, but I'm also obviously Russian,\" she says. \"There are different categories of immigrants. Some are so integrated that they almost deny where they came from, while at the other end, some people don't integrate at all. \"I'm somewhere in the middle, I'm fully integrated, I went to a British university... I speak English.... but I also like my Russian heritage, which I nurture through the bathhouse and through the network.\"", "question": "As leisure @placeholder go , you would imagine that lying naked on a wooden table while two topless Russian men hit your back with bunches of oak leaves would only appeal to a very specialist group of enthusiasts .", "option_0": "continues", "option_1": "arrives", "option_2": "prepares", "option_3": "activities", "option_4": "affects", "label": 3}

{"article": "The centrepiece is a plan to take any refugees and migrants who cross the sea to Greece in smugglers' boats and return them, directly, to Turkey. European Union officials say whatever is finally agreed \"will comply with both European and international law\". Privately, though, some admit that, while the assessment of their lawyers is \"quite promising\", there are legal hurdles that must be overcome. So can Europe carry out mass returns of entire groups of people? UN officials have cited the European Convention on Human Rights, arguing that it explicitly prohibits the collective expulsion of foreigners. And they say that under international law, it is not illegal for someone fleeing persecution and conflict to cross a border and ask for asylum. Around 90% of those arriving in the Greek islands say they are fleeing conflict, primarily from Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan. Under international law, each person's case must be heard on an individual basis, not as a group, because they may have very good reasons for seeking protection. The second difficulty, UN officials have said, is that while returns can be legal, people can only be sent back to a country that is safe, is able to care for them, give them full access to work, to education, to healthcare, and, most important of all, will take responsibility for processing the individual's asylum claim. The reason many Syrians are leaving Turkey is that it can't provide work, education and healthcare for them all. A system to apply for asylum in Europe from Turkey doesn't exist yet. Until now, the EU has not returned people to Turkey. It hasn't viewed Turkey as what's called a \"safe third country\". Turkey is not a full member of the Geneva Convention. It does not offer Syrians asylum, only a lesser form of international protection. And other groups like Iraqis and Afghans don't even have that option in Turkey. So while returning Syrians is questionable, returning non-Syrians may be even more problematic. Even if all the legal issues are settled there remains the practical problem of how Greece would send back all those making the crossings. Desperate people, men, women and children would have to be rounded up, held and then transported back across the sea. In exchange for the mass returns, the EU is offering to take in large numbers of asylum seekers directly from Turkey. So for every Syrian sent back to Turkey, one already in Turkey will be resettled in Europe. But finding EU countries willing to accept the new arrivals may not be easy. Last year, EU countries pledged to shift thousands of refugees directly from Greece, Italy, and Turkey and give them new homes in the EU. Just a few hundred have actually been moved. Could countries achieve now what they have failed to make happen so far? Hungary has made clear that it is not prepared to accept quotas under this new plan. Other countries in central and eastern Europe are also opposed. So to make this work, a \"coalition of the willing\" - countries prepared to welcome Syrians - will have to be assembled. Germany and the Netherlands may have to be the leaders here, but they will need support from other states too. Among Turkey's demands to secure a deal is visa-free access to the EU for Turks, ideally by the end of June, but there is significant political resistance. It would allow more than 70 million Turks to travel (but not work) visa-free in Europe's Schengen zone. That hasn't happened before now because some EU countries have worried about the political backlash at home from anti-immigrant parties. France in particular has been opposed. The indications from behind closed doors at the summit were that President Francois Hollande may be willing to accept a deal on visas. But then there is the problem that Turkey does not officially recognise the Greek-Cypriot government in Nicosia (Cyprus is an EU member). That's one issue to overcome, and there is also significant opposition to visa concessions for Turkey in the European Parliament, which would have to approve the change as well. Even if all of these issues are resolved, sources say that EU countries will probably still insist Turkey meet all the technical conditions necessary for visa-free access. The hurdles, such as Turkey introducing more sophisticated biometric passports, are significant. This is another of Turkey's demands. It may be largely symbolic, as most EU countries believe Turkey is years away from achieving EU membership, but making any headway on this will be even harder than on the subject of visas. Opposition from Cyprus is one big issue here. Turkey must recognise the government in Cyprus before any new discussions open. Cyprus has stated clearly that it has a clear understanding from other EU countries that \"Turkey cannot use its role in the refugee crisis... to ask for exchanges as regards its EU accession course\". Other countries like Italy and Belgium have doubts about making concessions at a time when there are serious concerns about Turkey's political direction, about declining media freedoms, and worries about a shift towards greater authoritarianism in Turkey's politics. Privately, EU sources say agreement even to open any new accession discussions will be \"very difficult\" and is one of the most important things to clarify if a deal is to be done next week. For all the difficulties, though, there are powerful, political reasons why all sides want a deal. The EU as a whole wants to regain control of events in this refugee crisis. There is a real concern that countries have started going it alone, consensus has broken down, and the EU has to find a plan that reverses that dynamic. There is also a fear that if the refugee crisis remains unresolved, it could affect Britain's EU referendum. Angela Merkel needs a deal as she's come under huge political pressure at home. And the crisis has caused a real rift between the leaders of Germany and Austria that needs to be mended. Other EU leaders want to show their electorates they can protect the EU's borders, fearing that otherwise anti-immigrant parties will seize the political initiative. Closing some border crossings to deal with the refugee crisis has had economic costs too. And a deal suits Turkey as well. It is hosting millions of refugees and is under serious pressure because of the way the war in Syria has shifted with Russia's involvement. Despite their difficulties, the EU and Turkey both benefit if they can make a strategic relationship work, and they need support from each other to deal with the crises they are facing. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

Some embed QR codes on tombstones - scanning the code with your phone allows you to access interactive memorials featuring photos and videos of your loved ones. The Changqing cemetery in Beijing has gone one step further by removing the actual grave itself - the deceased is cremated and their ashes put in a biodegradable urn. The family is then given a plaque engraved with a QR code as a sort of virtual grave. It is the latest space-saving measure in China where authorities have been promoting cremation and other alternatives to traditional burials. Hiring professional mourners has also become increasingly popular in recent years among those unable to travel home to pay their respects. But it has attracted an inevitable backlash among traditionalists who see it as insincere. Another reason to encourage virtual mourning is that it cuts down on air pollution during the festival, which is officially on 4 April but is observed throughout the week. The Chinese believe that burning joss sticks, joss paper, and paper offerings - sometimes quite large ones - honours the dead and transmits money and other goods to their loved ones in the afterlife. In Singapore, one Buddhist temple this year has banned devotees from burning \"treasure chests\" - large paper boxes containing paper clothes and luxury goods - reports The Straits Times. Meanwhile in Malaysia - where dengue fever is a concern - some shops are selling biodegradable urns for joss sticks, to replace normal urns which could collect rain water and breed mosquitoes. Still, that has not stopped some Chinese people from splashing out on extravagant and modern offerings for the dead. Burning paper versions of luxury clothes, handbags, watches, and gadgets is not uncommon. One Chinese family in Malaysia this year took it to another level this year when they spent the equivalent of Â£3,035 ($3,800) on a life-size replica of a yellow Lamborghini. The paper craftsman told the Sin Chew Daily newspaper that he had received orders for \"super bikes, yachts, aeroplanes and bicycles\" as well.", "question": "@placeholder of ethnic Chinese people will be paying their respects to dead ancestors this week , as they observe the ancient Qing Ming festival .", "option_0": "swarms", "option_1": "Millions", "option_2": "dozens", "option_3": "scores", "option_4": "millions", "label": 1}

{"article": "Now the insurance industry is calling on carmakers to provide more data showing who was at fault in accidents involving driverless vehicles. The insurers say drivers need to be able to prove that they're not at fault if the technology goes wrong. The Association of British Insurers wants cars to collect a basic set of core data which would be made available after an accident. The data would cover a period 30 seconds before and 15 seconds after any incident. It would include the exact location of the vehicle, whether it was in autonomous mode or under the control of the driver, and whether the motorist was in the driver's seat and had a seatbelt on. The ABI's Director General Huw Evans says this data \"would offer public reassurance by protecting motorists from being incorrectly blamed if something fails with their car, helping police investigations and supporting prompt insurance payouts.\" The UN body which agrees international regulations on vehicle safety is due to bring in new rules on data collection in 2019 and the insurers are hoping to influence that process. In the long term, fully autonomous vehicles could make the roads so safe that there would be little need for motor insurance. But for the next few years, as more cars get autonomous driving features, there could be a period of dangerous confusion for motorists. That certainly struck me after spending a morning on a test track owned by the insurance industry's Thatcham Research Centre. I sat in a Tesla being driven by Thatcham's Matthew Avery - and reflected that in a few years' time I might be sitting in a passenger seat with nobody at the wheel. Matthew took his hands off the wheel after switching on the Tesla's Autopilot self-driving mode and explained that on a public road this would not be allowed. He says the rules will change - but gradually: \"In 2019 you will be able to buy a car with an autopilot system where you can take your hands off the wheel for up to three minutes. But that will only work on a motorway.\" But as cars become more automated he admits that drivers will struggle to understand what is, and is not, allowed. \"When the customer can buy a car like this it's going to be confusing to him to understand what is allowed. Do I have to be in control or can I get in the back of the car and have a sleep?\" The answer, he says, is no - we will have to wait until the mid 2020s for a vehicle that can be left to get on with the job in all circumstances. Up until then we are going to be stuck in the messy middle ground - allowing the car to take some of the strain of driving, while keeping our hands hovering over the wheel and our eyes on the road. If that is the case, just how attractive autonomous driving technology will be to motorists - and whether they will pay more for it - must be open to question.", "question": "Driverless car technology seems to be advancing at breakneck speed - but the changes this will mean for the rules of the road are proceeding at a slower @placeholder .", "option_0": "pace", "option_1": "summit", "option_2": "level", "option_3": "centre", "option_4": "event", "label": 0}

{"article": "So imagine what it's been like for Banks, a performer who used to suffer such severe stage fright she would sing with her back turned to the audience. The Californian musician, whose full name is Jillian Banks, first came to attention in 2013 with her London EP - a collection of brooding, vulnerable R&B that earned her a spot on the BBC's Sound of 2014 list. Her debut album, Goddess, reached the top 20 on both sides of the Atlantic, but the star quickly found fame stressful and frustrating. \"I had to learn how to talk to people and tell them what I wanted,\" she says, \"But I felt people weren't listening. I felt really helpless sometimes.\" Things came to a head when she took her music on the road. \"The first tour I went on, the guitarist slammed a door in my face. That would never happen now. If somebody treated me like that, they'd be out five minutes later.\" The singer's metamorphosis from wallflower to self-professed \"bad mother\" is documented on her new album, The Altar. \"Do you see me now?\" she demands on Mind Games, while on Weaker Girl, she chastises a lover who can't handle \"the way I grew strong\". \"You have to have that mentality in order to survive,\" she says. \"Not only in this business, in life. You can't be like a feather blowing in every direction the wind takes you.\" On the phone from Paris, she explains The Altar's backstory and why she keeps a replica of her severed head in a box. Good afternoon, Banks. How is Paris? I love it. I wish I could see more of it today. Is there a country you've fallen in love with while you've been on tour? I love Switzerland. I played the Montreux Jazz Festival and that was one of my favourite places. But also - I don't know if this sounds funny - but when I saw more of America, I realised how different every city was. I always had this idea that Europe would be more exciting to me, which it was, but places like Boston and Seattle and Houston were just as exciting. The Altar is out this week. Is it nerve-wracking to find out what fans think? Yeah, it is. I feel different about it every 20 minutes. It feels like a much more confident record. Did you feel emboldened by the success of your debut album? No! I think I'm very introverted, first of all, so this business was very overwhelming. I was nervous to be around so many different people. I mean, I don't think anybody knows how to tell 50 people on a video set that they want to make changes, especially when they're young.  But I felt, for the first time, like people weren't giving me the respect that I deserved. And when I went into this album, I was feeling the after-effects of that frustration. I had this need to feel empowered. I needed to let go of that person who was afraid to say what she wanted. The videos for this album have certainly been uncompromising. In F With Myself, you're abusing a mannequin that's been made in your likeness. That was the most fun I've ever had on a video set! It represented exactly what that song means to me. I can be my own biggest bully - like, I'm chronically unsatisfied - but I've had to learn, especially over the last two years, to be my own biggest ally. Deciding I wanted to make a prosthetic form of myself and interact with it, it took confidence to say that out loud, even. It's one of those ideas that, I assume, sounded really good on paper - but turned out to be quite bizarre in real life. It was weird! You only ever see a mirror image of yourself, so it was strange to see myself in 3D. But it was kind of therapeutic - especially hitting my own face, because it made me want to be really nice to myself. It was like seeing physically what I do to myself mentally sometimes. What have you done with the head now? I have it still. It smells weird because we lit it on fire, so I keep it in a box. But it's still mine! You should get it out at Halloween and scare some trick or treaters to death. Oh God! That's such a good idea. My mum hated that video, because she hated  seeing me slap my face around. But that means it's good, if your mum doesn't like something. What about you? How do you feel about the songs now they're finished? Are they hard to listen to objectively? Yeah, because it's like reading your own diary entries from the past: Nobody does that. When I'm thinking about a concept for a video, I love going on long walks and listening to the song on a loop. But I would never normally go on a walk and, just for fun, listen to a song like To The Hilt. To The Hilt is especially raw, though. In the lyrics, you describe how breaking up with your muse left you \"drained creatively\". Was it hard to record? It was hard to write, but I'm happy I did and I felt deeply relieved that I got it out of my system. The vocal is very unguarded. I recorded it with  (British producer) SOHN and I did it twice all the way through, then I told him I wouldn't do it any more. So I think it's the first or second take. It was super draining. You've spoken quite openly about how you suffered from depression while making this album. How did it affect your writing? I've struggled with depression since I was younger. It's just how I was wired - but it's not all the time. It usually hits me right before I give birth to something new. On this occasion, it was letting go and becoming this new version of myself. It's like the universe's way of pulling you backwards almost, and you have to fight to move forward. Like emerging from a cocoon? That's exactly what it is. The two years before I made this album, I felt the weight of learning to accept myself as a woman and an adult in this strange society that sometimes makes women feel less powerful than they should. And I don't just write when I'm sad, by the way. Lovesick is a song about falling in love really hard, and it's very uplifting. And This Is Not About Us is a really empowering song. You're part of a wave of female artists - from Beyonce and Grimes to Tove Lo - who are unapologetic about the strength they derive from their femininity. Do you talk to other artists about that? I actually just emailed Feist because we have a mutual friend who thought we would get along. And I met Tove Lo at a festival in Toronto. She was standing side stage, singing all my lyrics. I just thought that was so cool, because for women to support each other and not feel competitive is so important. I already was a fan of her music and everything she stands for. It made me love her 10 times more. I heard you wrote the verses to Trainwreck when you were 14. Most people would cringe at their teenage poetryâ€¦ It's funny. I actually recently found this old computer of mine that I had when I was young. It had this weird app on it where I could videotape myself, and I listened back to some of the songs and I was like, \"Some of these melodies are really good. I want to mess with them more.\" The Altar is out now on Virgin EMI / Harvest Records.

{"article": "His response to deadly violence in Charlottesville was widely seen as too vague in its condemnation of neo-Nazis, while some supporters have been scathing about his announcement of more US troops for Afghanistan, a commitment he had promised to end. The Arizona rally - unusual for a serving president - was his response. Mr Trump accused journalists of misrepresenting his \"perfect\" words in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was killed after a car ploughed into a crowd of people protesting against far-right demonstrators including neo-Nazis. \"For the most part,\" Mr Trump said, \"these are really, really dishonest people, and they're bad people. And I really think they don't like our country.\" \"The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself, and the fake news,\" he added, accusing the media of being the \"source of division in this country\". The president then wrongly alleged that US TV networks were ending their live coverage of his speech because he was criticising them. Mr Trump has been accused by right-wing Breitbart news - run by his former chief strategist Steve Bannon - of \"flip-flopping\" on his \"America first\" approach and instead copying Barack Obama's Afghanistan policy. In response he talked up his support for military veterans, said he was increasing defence spending so that troops were well-equipped and said \"every American deserves a government that protects them... and fights for them.\" He also said a pro-active approach to foreign policy had led to North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un \"starting to respect the US\". \"I respect that fact very much. Respect that fact,\" he said. Mr Trump was at pains to say he wanted a better America for all its citizens, including immigrants. But some of his remarks appeared designed to appeal to those of his supporters who have been accused of being white nationalists. Mr Trump again linked illegal immigration to crime and drugs. \"This is like from a different age... These are animals. We are getting them out of here. We're throwing them in jails, and we're throwing them out of the country. We're liberating our towns,\" he said. He hinted at a possible presidential pardon for controversial former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who rose to national prominence because of his tough stance against illegal immigration and was found guilty of  in July over his detention of migrants. And he also made an apparent reference to the removal of Confederate statues - monuments to figures from the slavery-supporting southern states that attempted to secede from the union. Imploring people not to take down statues of former presidents such as George Washington, he echoed the objection of those who do not want Confederate statues removed. \"They're trying to take away our culture. They are trying to take away our history,\" he said. No Trump rally is complete without a reference to Mr Trump's proposed barrier on the Mexican border - which he says will keep out illegal immigrants and drug traffickers. \"If we have to close down our government, we're building that wall,\" he said. Mr Trump has always insisted Mexico will pay, but has accepted that US taxpayers will have to cover the initial funding and he wants money allocated in the upcoming US budget. If there is no deal on the budget and the debt ceiling then the federal government will shut down, federal employees will not go to work and millions of people will not get paid get paid. A showdown in Washington looms. Mr Trump also said he would \"probably end up terminating Nafta\" - the free trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada. Mr Trump made sure to tell his audience that he had not sold out, despite having become president and not yet having turned many of his campaign promises into reality. \"I always hear about the elite. You know, the elite. They're elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were. I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great,\" he said. \"I think - you know what? I think we're the elites. They're not the elites,\" he added. Later he distanced himself from some commentators' description of his Afghanistan policy speech as \"presidential\". Referring to Senator John McCain's vote against his bid to repeal Obamacare, he said: \"You know, they all said, Mr President, your speech was so good last night, please, please, Mr President don't mention any names. \"So I won't. I won't. No I won't vote - one vote away, I will not mention any names. Very presidential, isn't it? Very presidential.\" Mr Trump's preoccupation with the relative numbers of his supporters and opponents at events continued. In the past he has insisted that more people attended his inauguration as president than were at President Obama's. He has also bristled at reminders that while he won the election, a larger number of people overall voted for his opponent Hillary Clinton. In Phoenix he told the crowd that the secret service had informed him that there were \"not too many people outside protesting\". He also said Phoenix had been the location of his first rally speech - \"The crowds were so big, almost as big as tonight\". But the Washington Post newspaper reported that some in the crowd lost interest in the president's speech, with \"hundreds\" leaving early and others sitting down and looking at their phones.", "question": "President Trump used his \" Make America Great Again \" rally to grab back @placeholder of the conversation following criticism from both opponents and supporters .", "option_0": "details", "option_1": "secrets", "option_2": "norms", "option_3": "parts", "option_4": "control", "label": 4}

{"article": "More than 400,000 NS&I savers will see interest rates on the Direct Isa cut from 1.5% to 1.25% a year. That is the lowest savings rate since NS&I introduced the product in 2008. Before the change was announced in September, the NS&I Direct Isa had been at the top of the best buy tables. But it was forced to reduce rates, partly because of the success of pensioner bonds earlier in the year. Government rules mean NS&I is not allowed to attract too much cash, in fairness to taxpayers and so as not to destabilise the savings market. Even though the Bank of England's base rate has remained at 0.5%, Isa rates across the industry have tumbled. TSB will cut rates on 11 December, and some HSBC customers are receiving letters about a reduction. HSBC has told BBC News it will cut the ISA rate paid to long-serving customers from 1.5% to 1.3% from next January, saying it had taken a \"difficult decision\". The highest paying Loyalty Cash ISA, for Premier current account users, will see the reduction, with matching falls for lower paying versions of the ISA. Back in October 2014, the average instant access Isa rate was 1.09%, according to the Bank of England. One year later, that had fallen to 0.98%. Some experts believe conditions could improve for savers  in January, when part of the Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) comes to an end. Under FLS, banks have been able to borrow funds cheaply from the Bank of England, lowering the cost of both loans and savings rates. Anna Bowes, director of Savings Champion, believes new customers could benefit, although existing customers may not. \"We can but hope that the providers involved will turn back to savers to raise the funds they require, which could see savings rates being pushed up,\" she said. \"Unfortunately we wouldn't expect to see existing savers benefit from this.\" Savers are being advised to move their money, as some lenders - such as the Coventry Building Society - have recently increased their Isa savings rates.", "question": "From Monday , @placeholder gets even tougher for savers , as National Savings and Investments ( NS&I ) brings in lower returns on its tax - free Individual Savings Accounts ( Isas ) .", "option_0": "revised", "option_1": "including", "option_2": "reached", "option_3": "helped", "option_4": "life", "label": 4}
{"article": "IS said the men were soldiers captured in the city of Homs. They were shot dead inside Palmyra's amphitheatre. Stills from the video showed the killers to be young males, possibly even as young as 13 or 14. IS captured Palmyra and the neighbouring modern city, locally known as Tadmur, in late May. The video was distributed by accounts known to be linked with Islamic State militants. It is not clear when it was filmed. The killings took place on a stage in the amphitheatre in front of a large black IS flag. Several hundred men in civilian clothes are filmed sitting on steps watching the shootings. Among them was a young boy. In close-up shots of the men waiting to be killed, they appear to have been beaten on the face. Days after IS claimed Palmyra, it executed 20 men in the same amphitheatre. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says shootings took place in the amphitheatre on 27 May, but it is not clear if those killings are the ones in the video. The video goes on to show the destruction of Tadmur prison, which occurred in late May. In May, Mamoun Abdelkarim, Syria's head of antiquities, said: \"Using the Roman theatre to execute people proves that these people are against humanity.\" Mr Abdulkarim said most of the museum's antiquities had been transferred to Damascus before IS approached the city. Since then, there have been reports that mines have been planted among some of Palmyra's ruins, and there were claims this week that militants destroyed an ancient sculpture outside Palmyra's museum. Since capturing the city, IS has also taken control of a military airbase and a notorious prison nearby. The ancient ruins are situated in a strategically important area on the road between the capital, Damascus, and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour. Fighters with IS started claiming vast swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, aided in part by the insecurity generated by Syria's civil war.

{"article": "Compared to the third quarter, growth was up 0.6%, beating market expectations of 0.4%. Household consumption, construction and public spending were the main factors driving the better-than-expected growth. The strong data comes despite the global commodity slump hitting the country's vital mining and oil sectors. Australia's benchmark ASX/200 was up 1.5% on the positive news. \"Given Australia is going through the biggest mining pullback in our lifetimes, this is a pretty good outcome,\" said David de Garis, a senior economist at National Australia Bank. Analysts also said the stronger-than-expected figure meant further cuts in interest rates were unlikely in the near future. The Australian central bank has held rates steady since May last year and earlier this week decided to keep its main interest rate at 2% for a tenth consecutive month saying it saw \"reasonable prospects\" for growth. However The Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens said the bank would be keeping an eye on the country's low inflation rate. \"Continued low inflation would provide scope for easier policy, should that be appropriate to lend support to demand,\" he said. Australians must be feeling pretty smug these days. Despite a collapse in global commodity prices, it has managed to escape recession yet again. So what are Australians getting right? Well - it may just come down to that \"lucky country\" clichÃ© we hear about \"Down Under\" all the time. There's no denying that as mines have closed, jobs have been lost and that's putting pressure on the government to find new avenues of growth - but don't forget Australia is already a highly diversified economy.

{"article": "Max Whitlock is only 22 but he has already won 21 major medals. He not only wants to dominate the world but become a giant of his sport, one of the greatest in history. But at the beginning of this year the boy from Hemel Hempstead with global ambitions could not accomplish routine twists and tricks. He was stressed, panicking. He did not know what was wrong. \"It was over a three-month period and I went from feeling the fittest I've ever been, making my routines, to slowly deteriorating. I'd struggle to do anything over 30 seconds long,\" Whitlock remembers. Training sessions would have provided wonderful material for those partial to the silly and slapstick; a double Olympic medallist gradually morphing into Frank Spencer, falling and toppling over when all he had known since the age of seven was gymnastic excellence. Whitlock is now at ease remembering those anxious spring months because, despite it all, last weekend he became the first British man to win a world gymnastics title, ending a nation's 112-year wait for gold. The illness which \"completely drained\" him, glandular fever as it turned out, helped push him further, he says. With the pommel horse gold he won at the World Championships in Glasgow resting on the table in front of him, alongside the two silvers he won on the floor and in the team event, Whitlock can laugh as he explains the turning point in his year, a training session on the parallel bars with his coach Scott Hann. \"I nearly landed on my head,\" he recalls, flashing a smile and shaking his head. \"I was trying a big skill, one of the new ones I'd put into my routine, but my body couldn't do it, my arms couldn't take it. It didn't go to plan. My coach drew a line under it and said 'I think you need to stop'.\" Blood tests revealed low-grade glandular fever, a viral infection which at its worst arrests sporting progress. Robin Soderling has been absent from the tennis circuit for four years; Heather Watson, currently Britain's second best female tennis player, was derailed for a season. On doctor's orders, there was three weeks of complete rest -  only the second time the Essex-based gymnast had been away from his gym in Basildon for such a period since London 2012 - before gradually returning to a familiar regime. \"I tried not to get out of bed, I was told rest was the only real help, which was tough,\" says Whitlock. \"But I do believe it got me more motivated to get back to where I was, and hopefully better. \"I only did an hour in the gym to start with and built it up as and when I could. I knew what I had to do, learn new skills for the Worlds and add difficulty for some of the apparatus.\" It was Whitlock's training, endlessly repeating routines during a 35-hour week, which prepared him for Saturday's knee-knocking climax at Glasgow's Hydro Arena. Louis Smith, Britain's most recognisable gymnast, a pioneer of his craft, had produced a flawless performance on the pommel horse to top the standings. Then came Whitlock, the final participant. Guns flexing, a gold-medal shoot-out awaiting him. The triple Commonwealth gold medallist was unaware of Smith's score. He never watches his fellow competitors perform, even if they're only 25m in front of him. That would be a distraction. Admiring others, he says, would affect his performance. Whitlock walked through the tunnel from the warm-up area towards the glare of the main stage's lights with his coach. Their conversation was concise, full of knowing nods, a telepathic understanding based on a decade-long partnership. Media playback is not supported on this device \"My coach asked 'so what are you going to do?'\" recalls Whitlock. \"My coach was watching Louis and knew he had a massive score but he didn't want to tell me because he knows me well. \"I asked 'do I need to do a bigger routine?' and he just said 'possibly' so from then on I knew there was a big score out there, it was very difficult to hide that fact, so we decided to up the difficulty. It was a last-minute thing. \"In previous years I've gone in with a set routine, but these championships were about doing the best possible - going for gold, but trying not to think or say that.\" The change, increasing the difficulty rating by a tenth, was a brilliant decision, Whitlock admits. He beat his team-mate by 0.1 points - the difference between gold and silver, between history-maker and nearly man. \"I had done the training, I was as ready as I could be. It was just about doing it,\" he says. \"It's about just going there, relaxing and enjoying the experience. It's become harder to do that. It's definitely a different type of pressure these days. Before the Olympics I was going in as the underdog, no-one was expecting anything, but every competition after that everyone has been expecting results.\" There is good reason for those cranked-up expectations. Since winning pommel horse bronze in 2012 as a 19-year-old in his first Olympic individual final, Whitlock has more often than not returned from major championships with a bag full of medals: five at World Championships, six at European Championships, five at last year's Commonwealth Games alone. In his social medial world, Whitlock's Twitter (46,500 followers) and Instagram accounts (42,600 fans) have \"gone crazy\" since the weekend. \"I do like it when people are thanking us for inspiring their kids, that sort of stuff means a lot to us because that's what it's all about,\" says Whitlock, successfully hiding inevitable fatigue after a 2.30am wake-up call to start a day of endless interviews. He is not the sort to get alarmed or frightened by the life-changing consequences of continued historic triumphs. He is, after all, an athlete whose star has constantly been rising, an ad man's dream. A clean living boy with a flair for design and numerous party tricks - one a back-flip with a football between his feet, directing the ball into an open boot of a car. At the beginning of the year Whitlock was chosen by British designer Paul Smith to be the face of a new advertising campaign. Videos of the suited Briton, pivoting and rotating in expensive designer clobber, have since been projected onto Tokyo skyscrapers. There will be more of that, because Whitlock wants it, but neither will he lose focus. He admits he loves being recognised but his main motivation is to become a \"legend\" in the world of gymnastics, with Olympic gold in Rio the next step on that mission. \"That's why we're so proud of this achievement,\" he says of his pommel horse gold and Britain's best ever World Championships medal haul of five. \"It feels amazing. I would love to be a legend in the sport and to do that I need to go to many, many Olympics and that's what my main aim is. I want to carry on as long as possible and do as many Olympic cycles as my body can take.\"", "question": "When Superman was sapped of his strength he knew to blame kryptonite .

Heard came under fire for failing to declare Pistol and Boo, the couple's Yorkshire terriers, to authorities on their arrival in Brisbane in April. Under strict Australian laws designed to keep disease at bay, dogs entering from the US must be declared and have to spend 10 days in quarantine. The case sparked global attention after the terriers were threatened with death by Australia's Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce, unless they went \"back to the United States\". Mr Joyce said he did not care if Depp had been voted the \"sexiest man alive\", he still had to adhere to quarantine rules. The animals, which had allegedly travelled by private jet to Queensland, where Depp was filming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, were quickly whisked out of the country as the story hit the headlines. In July she was charged with two counts of illegally importing the dogs into Australia and one count of producing a false document. Penalties range from a hefty fine to more than 10 years in prison.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Jean-Marc Bosman did not trademark any moments of skill, score famous late winners or carry his teams to success but he was good enough to win 20 youth caps for Belgium and break into the first team of one of his country's best clubs at 18. That, however, is not what earns him a place alongside Charlemagne, Audrey Hepburn and Hercule Poirot in a list of famous Belgians. Twenty years ago on Tuesday, Bosman emerged from the European Court of Justice with a win that turned Europe's top divisions into glorious expressions of multiculturalism and added a new noun to sport's lexicon: the Bosman. From that moment, players at the end of their contracts - David Beckham, Sol Campbell, Steve McManaman and many more - could move without a transfer fee. No longer would a player from the European Union have their opportunities in the single market curtailed by rules limiting the number of foreigners clubs could field. But for this softly spoken 51 year old, it was a case that almost ruined him. \"There have been real problems but I am feeling much better now,\" said Bosman when I asked him how he was after a spell in prison, bankruptcy and a long battle with alcoholism. \"I've had medical and psychological care and I also have blood samples taken on a regular basis. \"There have been difficulties and my financial situation is not easy but life has started over. I have regained strength and feel motivated. \"It has not been easy to find work after the ruling but I am not complaining. The tunnel is nearing its end.\" He entered that tunnel in 1990 when his contract with RFC Liege expired. With the club in financial trouble they wanted the midfielder to sign a new deal on a quarter of his former salary. Yet when Dunkerque, across the border in France, wanted to buy him, Liege demanded four times what they'd paid for him in the first place. \"It was illogical,\" said Bosman, explaining the moment he decided to become a \"freedom fighter\". His lawyer thought it would take two weeks. It took five years; a period that should have been the best years of a decent career. Banned in Belgium, Bosman moved to a second division club in France, only for them to go bust. Other clubs told him they would like to sign him but could not because they already had three foreigners. He had a brief spell on the island of La Reunion and another go in the Belgian leagues, but it is an understatement to say his decision to take football's business model to court made him less attractive to club chairmen. Broke, tired and out of shape, he accepted 350,000 Swiss francs in damages for his legal victory and began a life after football that he is still trying to work out. There was a disastrous investment in a t-shirt business (he had hoped grateful footballers would buy one, only his lawyer's son did so) and problems with the taxman. In 2011, he was convicted of assault following claims he had been involved in an argument with his girlfriend after he asked her daughter to get him some booze.  Initially, the courts were lenient but when he failed to pay his fine they were left with little choice. He was sentenced to a year in prison in 2013. It was then that Fifpro, the international trade union for footballers, stepped in. The stars he had helped become multi-millionaires may have forgotten him but his union did not. \"I was young and handsome then and I now have become old,\" he explained. \"Most of the players won't be able to recognise me but my case is still being talked about - I think that is positive. \"I may not be here in 20 years' time but they will still be talking about it and if someone remembers me I will give him my bank details. Everyone benefited from the Bosman ruling except me!\" I am speaking to him at Fifpro's swish headquarters in a suburb of Amsterdam. Bosman has become a spokesman for the organisation's campaign to finish what he started: scrap transfer fees entirely. The best way to understand this is to view Bosman as a battle in a 125-year war between clubs and players. The players won Bosman but were \"ambushed\", in the words of Fifpro's general secretary Theo van Seggelen, six years later. The European Commission made a deal with the game's governing bodies, Uefa and Fifa, to stem what the clubs claimed was rampant \"player power\". This deal was enshrined in Fifa's Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players in 2001. These rules set out today's transfer system - windows - the concept of a protected period when a contract cannot be broken, maximum and minimum contract lengths and so on - and for Fifpro they amount to the pendulum swinging towards the clubs. Five years later, a row about Scottish defender Andy Webster's move from Hearts to Wigan Athletic saw that pendulum swing back. The details of the case are convoluted but the final ruling seemed to fix what compensation a player/new employer should pay the old employer for breaking a contract outside of the protected period. This sum would be the wages the player would earn if he stayed. This really could have been revolutionary but two years later the Court of Arbitration for Sport changed the compensation equation by adding pro rata slices of the initial transfer fee and an estimate of the player's replacement cost. Players such Andrea Pirlo or Robert Lewandowski could still let their contracts expire to get Bosman moves to new teams and bigger wages. But clubs wanting to sign players still under contract, even outside the protected period, would have to cough up some compensation, as Manchester City did with Raheem Sterling last summer. Quite right too, is the usual response to this compromise between a player's right to ply his trade on the one hand, and a club's right to stability and a league's competitive integrity on the other. Everton manager Roberto Martinez, the first Spanish player to get a Bosman to England, has criticised the transfer window, but does not want to scrap compensation. \"The Bosman ruling was a huge shock at the time but I used it and it now seems a normal way to move freely,\" said Martinez last week. \"Football has benefited from the multicultural input of players and it seems normal now. \"But it wouldn't be right to scrap transfer fees. The value of a footballer is important and the value of developing players is important.\" But Fifpro's Van Seggelen says this view is based on a misunderstanding of the players' position, as well as being unfounded in truth. Dr Stefan Szymanski, author of the best-selling Soccernomics and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, did some research for Fifpro earlier this year which outlined how the system was failing to do any of the things it promised in 2001. According to Szymanski, the settlement has led to the rich clubs getting richer as more than half of all transfer spending circulates among them, with little trickling down the pyramid, far less than is syphoned off by agents. He also outlined how the same clubs and leagues keep winning, while the same types of clubs and leagues keep failing, leaving themselves, he says, vulnerable to match-fixing, third-party ownership and the trafficking of minors. \"We thought the transfer system was finished on 15 December, 1995, but of course it isn't,\" explained Van Seggelen. \"In fact, the situation is even worse than before. I often say to people 'how would you feel if you had to wait three months for your salary?' \"You also have players waiting years for justice through the tribunal system, and even when he has a positive decision there is no enforcement system. We cannot accept that.\" That might win over a few more voters on the terraces but there will still be many in the \"Bosman ruined football\" camp who think this is simply a union fighting for more money for its members, and in this case the members are loaded. \"Only 1% of our members are financially independent, so not every player is making that kind of money,\" said Van Seggelen. \"We're not trying to make them richer. In an ideal world, every player would play at the level they belong. \"I don't know why the clubs are so nervous. We are not trying to kill the top clubs or leagues. \"Sport is unusual but it must be reasonable. It's an economic activity, a business, so it must respect the law.\" By this point, Bosman is outside smoking. Despite arriving late and looking like he could not wait for the interview to end, he was good company. He does not watch much football these days, he cannot afford the television subscriptions, but what he sees he enjoys. His main focus is looking after his two young boys and being a better dad to the grown-up daughter he has from an earlier relationship. \"Martin and Samuel are too young to know about my case, I don't want to complicate their lives with it, they've just left kindergarten,\" he said. \"But I think later, when they grow up, they could find out about what their dad has done for professional players on the internet and they will see their dad has done something good. \"Back then clubs were selling hens, horses, mules and pigs, but not humans. \"Players should be considered as workers, full stop, that's it!

It was a very difficult decision,\" he says, \"but we saw people fleeing and we didn't want to stay to see what happened.\" This remote corner of parched scrub seems far removed from the dramatic events in Sirte last October, as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi was dragged from a sewer, called a rat and beaten to death by fighters from the then rebel National Transitional Council. Contamination But, for seasoned observers, the arrival of these refugees is the beginning of the nightmare scenario that many feared would follow the Libyan conflict. The refugees who arrived in Mangaize, in northern Niger, are fleeing clashes between Malian ethnic Tuareg rebels from the newly-formed National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and the national army which broke out in January 2012. Some 130,000 people have fled their homes, according to the UN refugee agency. These Tuaregs had, until September, been busy fighting alongside Col Gaddafi's forces as he struggled to cling to power in Libya. They had taken sanctuary in Libya after their own rebellion in Mali in 2008 was defeated. But as Col Gaddafi's luck began to turn south, they picked up the spoils of war around them and headed in the same direction; straight into the deserts of northern Mali, already unstable following attacks from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The contamination does not stop there. Niger - now hosting some 23,000 refugees - is worried that its own Tuareg population may rise up in rebellion, inspired by the MNLA. A former rebellion in northern Niger led by the MNJ (Nigerien Movement for Justice), with links to the Malian Tuaregs, wreaked havoc in the north from 2007-9. \"We're upset that the Malians have allowed this situation to get out of control,\" says Bazoum Mohammed, Niger's foreign minister. \"Everyone knew this situation was coming; everyone knew that AQIM was present in the region; everyone knew that the Tuareg rebellion from 2008 in Mali had not been decapitated. And yet the Malians did not act.\" Brief respite Former fighters from the MNJ were among a convoy that arrived in northern Niger in September, bringing Col Gaddafi's own son Saadi to safety. But, despite the evident dangers, Niger's authorities seem to have chosen to fight. Patrols in the far-flung north of the country have been stepped up, and in the months following Col Gaddafi's fall from Tripoli, many ex-fighters from Libya coming into Niger were disarmed. Regular surveillance flights supported by the US Pan-Sahelian Counter Terrorism Initiative patrol the skies, looking for unusual movements. And former rebels have been integrated into government - the new prime minister appointed in April 2011 is a Tuareg, as are most of the local officials in Agadez. \"We dealt with the Tuareg problem better than Mali did,\" says Mr Mohammed. \"There will be no repeat here.\" Niger is hoping that its efforts will be matched by those of regional powers, with Niger calling for a regional force to be sent to Mali at a recent summit of the West African body, Ecowas . Most observers agree that Niger's strong actions have reduced the imminent danger of a Tuareg rebellion within its own territory.

{"article": "However, intriguingly, there was rather more peace in the Holyrood committee room than one might have anticipated. The advance billing was primarily of conflict. The BBC, it was said, was failing to serve Scotland. Not enough output made it to the network. Licence fee payers north of the Border got a raw deal. Plus continuing disquiet, emanating from the SNP in particular, about news coverage. To be clear, there was exceptionally close questioning directed at the BBC bosses - the Director General Tony Hall, the Managing Director for Finance Anne Bulford, and the Director Scotland Ken MacQuarrie. In that regard, the committee convener Stewart Maxwell was to the fore - but was ably supported by members such as Chic Brodie, Mary Scanlon and Liam McArthur. £323m Licence fee generated in Scotland £123m - Scottish-only output spend £82m - Scottish-made network output £132.5m - UK programmes and services available to Scotland In particular, the SNP's Gordon MacDonald - a former management accountant - plainly relished a return to his old profession, pursuing his financial inquiries with thoroughly admirable diligence, reminiscent of an indefatigable terrier. George Adam even contrived to work in a reference to his beloved Paisley. Steven Moffat - he of Dr Who and Sherlock - is apparently a Buddy (and, who knows, a buddy.) Mr Adam followed this up with sharp questioning about money and power. But still the overall tone was business-like rather than overtly adversarial. It seemed to me that the committee scented the prospect of a negotiated settlement which could be distinctly to Scotland's advantage. That impression has not lessened from subsequent conversations. That tone persisted in the evidence session with the Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop. She stressed she was not seeking a fight. She wanted a deal - which would bring investment and jobs to Scotland. Things, she suggested, were moving in that direction. To the detail. Sundry MSPs parsed these numbers. What were those top-up costs? How were they justified? Why was investment per head still greater in Wales and Northern Ireland than in Scotland? In particular, those network programmes made in Scotland. How did they qualify to be Scottish? Were many of them not just \"lift and shift\" - that is, programmes envisioned elsewhere but transferred to Scotland? The argument flowed back and forth. It was argued forcibly that programmes with a Scottish base contribute to jobs and development here. However, Tony Hall acknowledged that it was now time to move to a new phase: with further power in Scotland allied to programmes which offered a more sustained and authentic portrait of Scotland. Further, the Director General confirmed a review of news, due to report in the Spring - which might include such familiar concepts as a Scottish Six, a TV programme encompassing Scottish, UK and global news. Ken MacQuarrie was questioned about earlier ideas such as new Scottish TV and radio channels. Those, he said, had never formed part of a formal plan.  They were notions around during the earliest stages of preparing for the Charter Review, itself due to be completed by the end of this year. Tony Hall suggested the focus now - particularly in the light of the relatively constrained licence fee settlement - might more usefully be upon programmes, rather than delivery mechanisms. On governance, he said that he favoured a unitary board for the BBC with a distinctive Scottish presence. In essence, his argument was for an enhanced BBC Scotland offer within a renewed BBC. To be clear, once more, there remains deep scepticism among the MSPs. Across parties but particularly in SNP ranks. This has by no means, by no means, been entirely assuaged. But they heard the BBC executives, led by Tony Hall, seeking to address their concerns, moving to acknowledge issues surrounding funding, commissioning and decision-making. So where now? I believe those three elements - funding, commissioning and decision-making - will form the core of the committee report. I believe further that the committee members will seek to sound a positive note, amid the scepticism, urging the BBC to act in a fashion which could generate investment and jobs for Scotland.

The total prize money was $10.9m, with the runners-up getting $1.4m, and $4.5m distributed among the other 19 teams taking part in the tournament, which began on 18 July in Seattle. Valve donated $1.6m of the prize money, but the rest was raised by some of the millions of people who regularly play the game. Dota 2 is as a multiplayer online battle arena game for the PC.

Video streams of the matches have been shared online, and Valve even ran a \"newcomer\" series to educate people new to the game. In addition, some bars, pubs and gaming centres around the world held parties for people keen to see the finals in a crowd.

{"article": "The soon-to-be 45th President of the United States of America has already made an assessment of the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Donald Trump has called Kim Jong-un a \"bad dude\".  But he also added that he would be prepared to meet him over a hamburger. And Kim Jong-un seems to have made an assessment of the president-elect.  In June, the state-controlled media called Mr Trump a \"wise politician\" and the right choice for American voters. So might it be sweetness and light in the relationship between two leaders who are outspoken and upfront?  Neither lacks ego but might they yet find common ground? It seems unlikely. In Iowa in January, the American president-elect betrayed a trace of admiration, even as he suggested his counterpart was crazy. \"This guy, he's like a maniac, OK? And you have to give him credit. How many young guys - he was like 26 or 25 when his father died - take over these tough generals, and all of a sudden, you know, it's pretty amazing when you think of it,\" he said. \"How does he do that?\" And answering his own rhetorical question, Mr Trump said:  \"He wiped out the uncle. He wiped out this one, that one. I mean, this guy doesn't play games. And we can't play games with him. Because he really does have missiles. And he really does have nukes\". He does, though they are not yet fully functioning. The fear is his apparent commitment to missiles capable of striking the big American cities on the West Coast or Washington (which he has threatened to turn into a sea of flame). Kim Jong-un has also been shown inspecting what the North Korean media said were nuclear warheads, but the best expert assessment is that the missiles to deliver them are perhaps five years away. And North Korea warned that it might utilise what it could against the \"US Imperialists and the South Korean puppets\". As an official, blood-curdling video put it earlier in the year:  \"The right of a pre-emptive nuclear attack is not the monopoly of the United States.\" It has to be remembered that this kind of blood-thirsty rhetoric is frequent and relentless and rarely followed up by action. It may be as much sabre-rattling for internal politics (to keep the external threat at the forefront of North Korean minds) as it is for outside consumption. North Korea's nuclear programme: How advanced is it? So what might President Trump do to prevent North Korea fulfilling its ambition to become a fully-fledged nuclear power? On American television in February, Mr Trump indicated that he thought China was the key: \"China has control - absolute control - over North Korea. They don't say it, but they do. \"And they should make that problem disappear. China is sucking us dry. They're taking our money. They're taking our jobs. They're doing so much. We have rebuilt China with what they've taken out \"We have power over China, China should do that. I would force China to do it economically\". He has not indicated how \"economic\" pressure on Beijing could force its hand on Pyongyang, or what he thinks the consequences of being tougher on China (presumably with the threat of making trade more difficult) might be. There is always a degree of psychological second-guessing when it comes to North Korea. The risk here is that Kim Jong-un may simply be strengthened by outside attention. And while it is hard to understand fully the dynamics within North Korea, it may be that the louder an outside adversary is, the more Kim Jong-un can present himself as the strong defender of the nation to his own people. In this regard, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un would be interesting adversaries. In South Korea, there is now intense rumination on what a Trump presidency might mean to the alliance with America. Mr Trump said he would want South Korea to pay more for the presence of US troops in Asia:  \"We are defending South Korea, we're defending so many countries, we get peanuts\". He has also indicated that he would not be averse to South Korea and Japan having their own nuclear weapons. Both countries have the technology to develop them very quickly. That is viewed by many in South Korea as having the potential to destabilise the current balance of power in the region - If Japan went nuclear, the pressure on South Korea to do the same would be great.  And China would view nuclear weapons in either country as a serious threat. Five ways a Donald Trump presidency changes the world Professor John Delury, a specialist at Yonsei University in Seoul in the politics of China, told the BBC that Mr Trump's \"controversial and extreme ideas\" put into question \"the foundations of US policy towards Korea which have been in place since the Korean war.  He's put those on the table for negotiation\". And he thought that Beijing would be pleased with Mr Trump's election because of his scant experience in foreign affairs. \"I would anticipate that in Beijing right now there's a little bit of licking the chops about what China can do to advance its position in Asia, given that there's an isolationist president taking over, one who doesn't have that depth of foreign policy experience,\" he said. \"It may be a happy day in certain quarters of power in Beijing\". Mr Trump will have to learn fast in this region where emboldened Chinese authority pushes at boundaries and tests America's allies. If China is pushed by Mr Trump might it push back and resist American pressure - and might that actually cement Kim Jong-un's power? These are fine judgements for the most subtle of political minds. Mr Trump may or may not have such an intelligence. It is a new field for him - a minefield.", "question": "In the list of urgent priorities awaiting the US president - elect North Korea is likely to be near the top .

{"article": "The Tory leader said she was the only person who could \"deliver for Britain\" and negotiate the right Brexit deal. Warning of \"five more years of Tory austerity\", Labour's leader promised more spending on health and education. The Lib Dems are focusing on Remain-voting target seats while UKIP says only it can stop Brexit \"backsliding\". In Scotland, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has warned that a vote for Labour risks \"handing the keys of No 10\" to Theresa May, while leaders in Wales and Northern Ireland are also making their last pitch for votes. After a week dominated by security issues since the terror attack in London, the prime minister promised on Tuesday to change human rights laws if they hamper a crackdown on terror suspects, by potentially seeking opt-outs from the European Convention on Human Rights. The proposals have been criticised by her opponents, who have urged that \"basic rights\" should be upheld. But returning to her central message on Brexit - the reason she gave for calling Thursday's election 50 days ago - Mrs May said that money which has until now been spent on EU projects could deliver \"huge benefits\" across the UK after its withdrawal, due in 2019. She has been highlighting her party's promise to put Â£23bn into a National Productivity Investment Fund, focusing on housing, road, rail and broadband improvements. The PM's day started in London, where she chatted to butchers at Smithfield meat market in the City. She was accompanied by her husband, Philip, who was also at her side as she visited Southampton and Norwich. Speaking in Norwich, she said a Labour government would \"wreck the economy\" while she wanted to build a country that was \"more confident in itself and in which no community was left behind\". Mrs May, who will end the day in the West Mildands, said that negotiations with the EU would begin in less than a fortnight and the question for voters was about who they trusted to deliver the best deal for Britain: \"Brexit matters, Brexit is the basis of everything else. We need to get that Brexit deal right.\" But emphasising Labour's plan to invest billions on public services, to be paid for by higher taxes on business and top earners, Mr Corbyn said the NHS could not afford \"five more years of underfunding, understaffing and privatisation\". Addressing activists in Runcorn, he said the election was \"all about the kind of society we want to live in\", saying: \"Never before has there been a clearer choice between the parties... a choice quite simply between hope and fear.\" He said: \"The re-election of a Theresa May government will mean five more years of cuts to the NHS, five more years of increases in waiting times, five more years of more and more people waiting for social care and five more years of austerity.\" Instead, Mr Corbyn - who has also addressed crowds in Glasgow and Colwyn Bay - urged people to reject this \"arid road\" and back Labour's \"positive and inclusive\" vision. The Labour leader has had to reshuffle his top team on the eve of the election after announcing shadow home secretary Diane Abbott would be taking a break because of ill health. Ms Abbott pulled out of a number of media engagements on Tuesday and the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said Lyn Brown, the shadow police minister and candidate for West Ham, had been asked to stand in for her indefinitely. Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has urged Labour supporters to \"send a message\" to Theresa May on issues such as Brexit and social care by supporting his party in seats where they are the Tories' main challengers. Endorsing tactical voting on campaign stops in Solihull, St Albans and Twickenham, he said: \"This was undoubtedly an election called in the interests of the Conservative Party and it hasn't quite turned out the way she expected because Theresa May's made some very poor decisions, that have shown weakness and a level of heartlessness.\" Former Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party offered an alternative to the continuing austerity proposed by the Conservatives and Jeremy Corbyn's \"Venezuelan-style socialism\". Campaigning in Edinburgh, the Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said re-electing SNP MPs would ensure Scotland retained a \"strong voice\" in Westminster and deny the Conservatives the \"crushing majority\" they were expecting. \"People in Scotland should not risk waking up to Tory MPs who can hand Theresa May a majority and then rubber stamp anything she wants,\" she said. \"Instead, voters should take the opportunity to stand up for Scotland's schools, hospitals, public services, pensioners and jobs by rejecting the Tories' extreme and dangerous plans.\" At their final election rally, the Green Party called on people to \"vote with their hearts\". \"I'm calling on people across the UK to vote not just for the MP they want, but the kind of country they want,\" co-leader Jonathan Bartley said, emphasising his party's opposition to the Trident nuclear deterrent and support for a universal weekly basic income. Visiting Great Yarmouth, UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said only his party could keep the pressure on the next government to deliver a \"real Brexit\" - with lower immigration, exclusive fishing rights for British trawlers within UK territorial waters and no \"divorce bill\". And Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said a re-elected Conservative government with an increased majority would pose a \"threat\" to Wales and her party would stand up for Welsh interests in the run-up to Brexit and afterwards.", "question": "Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are stressing core @placeholder as they and other party leaders criss - cross the UK in a last push for general election votes .", "option_0": "decline", "option_1": "dressed", "option_2": "themes", "option_3": "levels", "option_4": "disruption", "label": 2}

{"article": "It is the last place you'd wish to be on a starless night. They say that on one such night a fellow was playing cards with a stranger at the club when he happened to glance away from his hand and down to the stranger's foot on the floor. He spied a cloven hoof... and an icy hand clutched his heart. Hell-fire clubs have always been shrouded in rumours of devil worship and dark satanic deeds. How do you separate fact from fiction? Drive out of south Dublin and climb Mountpelier Hill and there, on top, squats the shell of the old hunting lodge built for Irish Parliamentary Speaker William Connolly in 1725. Now, a team of archaeologists are excavating the site to find out more about two prehistoric passage tombs on the hill - similar to Newgrange in Ireland's Boyne Valley. To build the lodge, they say that Connolly's workmen used stones from the ancient passage tombs - their destruction marks the start of the association of the site with the supernatural. Local legend has it that the devil was so enraged by the desecration that he blew off the wooden roof of the lodge in a storm. After Connolly's death, his widow leased the building to the Earl of Rosse, Richards Parsons, in 1735. He was one of the leading figures in the Dublin Hellfire Club - also known as The Blasters or the Young Bucks of Dublin. They were a group of aristocrats, described at the time by Gulliver's Travels writer Jonathan Swift as \"a brace of monsters, blasphemers and Bacchanalians\". Among his other proclivities, it was said that Rosse liked to receive guests in the nude - him, not them. The club was one of many in both England and Ireland where rich young rakes indulged in ceremonial drinking and dining and gambling and carousing. But a few clubs crossed the line into sex, blasphemy and sheer bloody badness - or so the rumour goes. The first hellfire club was set up by the Duke of Wharton and specialised in daring deeds like playing cards on Sunday, reading Lucretius and eating pigeon - known as \"Holy Ghost\" - pie, as chronicled in The Hellfire Clubs: Sex, Satanism and Secret Societies by Evelyn Lord. The most notorious club was formed by Sir Francis Dashwood with the motto \"Fais ce que tu voudrais\" - Do as you will. Dashwood's club included some of Britain's most senior statesmen and aristocrats. They met in a series of underground caves in West Wycombe and, legend has itindulged in lot of risque behaviour with the strict proviso: \"What goes on underground, stays underground.\" His club was called the Monks or Friars of St Francis of Wycombe. It was anything but saintly and involved drinking, wenching and banqueting. Later, there were suggestions of ritual abuse of women and Black Masses  - but perhaps people with an axe to grind would be keen to spread such rumours. Aisling Tierney, from Limerick, who has just finished a PhD in Bristol on the hellfire clubs, has been working on untangling the web of rumour and gossip and establishing the archaeological truth. Her interest was sparked when she came upon a copy of Geoffrey Ashe's Hell-Fire Clubs: A History of Anti-Morality in a second hand bookshop. The spark lit a fire. The clubs appeared in waves, first in London in the 1720s, then in Dublin and Limerick in the 1740s and then the Dashwood club of the 1750s, she said. People associated them with what was going morally wrong in society. \"There were parties, revels and prostitutes. There was sexual energy and drinking,\" she said. But to what extent were there acts of blasphemy? She points to a painting of Sir Francis Dashwood by Hogarth. \"He is portrayed as St Francis at prayer, but the Bible in front of him has been replaced by an erotic novel, A halo above his head shows a picture of his friend, the Earl of Sandwich, a miniature naked woman in front of him lies in what looks like the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa.\" At that time, blasphemy against Catholicism was permitted, she pointed out. But were they actually Satan worshippers? \"The newspapers of the time had stories of the devil walking among them and those stories spread like wildfire in the 1720s and even reached papers in the New World,\" she said. \"Yes, there was gossip and rumour, but there was no actual physical evidence to suggest they viewed themselves as devil worshippers.\" In Ireland, the Dublin Hellfire Club first met on Cork Hill at the Eagle tavern. In an article for the Irish Times, David Ryan-  author of the book, Blasphemers Blackguards: The Irish Hellfire Clubs -  calls the founder, the Earl of Rosse \" a notorious libertine fond of playing outrageous practical jokes on members of the clergy\". \"On one occasion he stripped naked to receive a visit from the eminent clergyman Samuel Madden, co-founder of the Dublin Society (now the Royal Dublin Society),\" he writes. \"Another of the club's members, James Worsdale, was an artist, playwright and womaniser. Once, on a visit to Mallow, he made a little too free with his landlady's daughter, causing the irate mother to beat him through the town with a hot shoulder of mutton. So far, so frivolous.\" But there was a much darker side to the club - it was a place where young rich aristocrats could get away, literally, with murder. \"When we come to one of the club's younger members, Henry, fourth Baron Barry of Santry, things start to get more sinister,\" writes Ryan. \"Lord Santry was civil enough - when sober. When intoxicated, as he often was, a much darker side was revealed. One of his most shocking crimes was the murder of an ill and bedridden servant. Having forced the unfortunate man to drink a bottle of brandy, Santry drenched his bedclothes in alcohol and set them alight, burning him alive. He escaped punishment by buying the silence of witnesses.\" And out of dirty deeds like this, the hellfire club got its gory reputation and cast a long shadow down the years. There is a tale that a young local farmer was curious about what happened and was found by club members wondering about. They dragged him inside and allowed him to see - the next morning he was found wondering on the mountain, unable to speak and he remained deaf and dumb for the rest of his life. There are stories of a black cat with ears like horns and evil eyes who took on a priest and still haunts the place - he is, they say, the size of a large Dalmatian. However David Ryan states that although the club members were rumoured to be devil worshippers, \"in reality they were freethinkers who believed in neither heaven or hell\". Aisling Tierney is equally sceptical about the satanic line. However, there is evidence that the Dublin lodge had an additional room added on. \"Maybe it was about being able to continue the party into the wee hours and collapsing into bed,\" she said. Nevertheless, the rumours are rife and the Dublin hellfire club's reputation for black magic and mystery and heinous goings on echoes down the years.", "question": "The notorious Hellfire Club in the Dublin mountains is a @placeholder murky with ugly rumours , dark deeds , black magic and blasphemy .", "option_0": "marked", "option_1": "heated", "option_2": "name", "option_3": "packed", "option_4": "growing", "label": 2}

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device A report into claims of bullying said British Cycling \"lacked good governance\" at board level. Cookson, who led the organisation for 17 years before becoming UCI president, said: \"If there was a lacking, I think we all share in that responsibility.\" He added British Cycling had been scrutinised by UK Sport. Asked if he was \"pinning the blame\" on the funding agency, he said: \"As I understand it, they were closely involved in how things were managed and monitored. \"I'm not trying to dodge any of my responsibility. What I'm saying is there were other people with responsibilities as well.\" The Phelps report into the culture of Britain's cycling team criticised former technical director Shane Sutton and UK Sport, and noted a \"culture of fear\" existed within the team, according to many staff members. \"I don't accept there was a culture of fear and I spent a lot of time at the National Cycling Centre,\" said Cookson, who is seeking re-election after joining the UCI in 2013. However, he said Sutton should have been moved following recommendations from the King Review in 2012. \"One of the recommendations was that Shane be moved out of direct coaching with athletes,\" he said. \"As far as I understood in the first half of 2013, that was one of those action-plan elements that was implemented and it was after that in the middle of 2013 I became a candidate and then was elected to the UCI presidency.\" Australian Sutton stayed on before resigning last year amid claims of sexism and was later found to have used sexist language towards cyclist Jess Varnish, though he was cleared of eight of the nine charges against him. Media playback is not supported on this device Cookson defended his record at British Cycling, saying: \"I'm not making any excuses for my behaviour. I think we made incredible progress and some great achievements. \"The idea we had no respect for athlete welfare is wrong. The relationship between athletes and coaches was something we were concerned about from time to time. Action was taken.\" And he disagrees with MP Damian Collins, who has called for board members from the period covered in the investigation to resign. \"My former colleagues at British Cycling have been committed to their sport over many years. Many of them are good people who have worked very hard,\" Cookson said. UK Anti-Doping is also investigating allegations of wrongdoing against Team Sky and British Cycling, which both deny. \"The reputational problems that have been around that team in the past few months have not been helpful. I want to wait for the outcome of UK Anti-Doping's enquiries,\" he said. Cookson said cycling had made significant progress in the battle against cheating during his tenure at the UCI. \"We were previously considered pariahs in the anti-doping world. Now we have one of he best reputations in sport, I believe,\" he added. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway Brian Cookson wants to be re-elected later this year for a second term as president of cycling's world governing body, and sees a fresh mandate as his future. However, his past is catching up with him. After a 17-year period as the president of British Cycling many believe it's under his tenure that the rot set in within the organisation, a fact addressed and criticised in the recent Phelps review. Cookson doesn't shirk responsibility for some of the major welfare issues that have occurred within British Cycling. But what is striking is that he refuses to accept wholesale blame. In my interview with him, he points the finger firmly at UK Sport, saying one of their officials was embedded within the world-class cycling programme at the Manchester velodrome and was involved in management and monitoring. Any \"lacking\" must be shared, he believes. His message is, in effect: 'Why should the blame fall only on my shoulders?' Shane Sutton, according to the 2012 King report, should have been moved away from direct coaching with athletes. We now know he referred to disabled cyclists as \"gimps and wobblies\" in addition to his role in Jess Varnish's departure from the British team. But Cookson points to the fact he moved in 2013 to be president of the UCI and, in his absence, Sutton carried on working with cyclists unimpeded and with serious consequences.

{"article": "Four years ago, GB Taekwondo became embroiled in arguably the biggest pre-London Olympic controversy when it picked rising star Lutalo Muhammad over then world number one Aaron Cook. After a bitter legal battle, Muhammad was eventually given the nod by the British Olympic Association (BOA) and went on to claim 2012 bronze. This week, at the European Championships in Switzerland, GB fighters will have the final chance to prove their Rio potential before the 2016 squad is selected. Olympic champion Jade Jones (-57kg), world gold medallist Bianca Walkden (+67kg) and leading +87kg heavyweight Mahama Cho look certainties for their respective divisions, while Cook - somewhat bizarrely - had his nationality purchased by Moldova last year and will fight for them in Brazil. However, Muhammad's road to Rio has been far from simple to navigate with new GB rival - Damon Sansum, a former kick-boxing world champion who won taekwondo world silver in 2015 - a serious contender. Only one fighter can represent Team GB in the -80kg category this summer. Demonstrating the ability to win an Olympic medal is a key component for GB selection and Sansum had the edge after securing world silver last year. However, Muhammad responded with victory at the Manchester World Taekwondo Grand Prix and secured Britain a -80kg berth through his end-of-year world ranking. Despite missing the start of the season through injury, he is fourth in the Olympic -80kg standings, with Sansum eighth, but both are confident of their prospects. \"I've been in hiding and doing secret training and I'm ready to show the world what they've been missing,\" Muhammad told BBC Sport. \"Rio is in my mind every day, but I'd rather not talk about selection, I want to focus on winning the Olympic gold medal - that's what I'm aiming for.\" Sansum believes improvements and regular medal-winning performances since switching sports prove his potential. \"It was difficult to adapt when I first moved over and London 2012 came too soon, but I've become much more consistent since then,\" he said. \"I transferred over because it was my dream to compete in an Olympics which you can't do in kick-boxing and I think I've shown I'm a serious medal contender.\" Media playback is not supported on this device World Taekwondo has attempted to reinvent the sport after a series of controversial results - many of which came at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. They included Briton Sarah Stevenson being initially eliminated, despite a late fight-winning head-kick, before a threatened walkout by all athletes saw her reinstated and ultimately win bronze. Although officials are still involved, points are now largely scored by athletes striking electronic pads mounted around the body and within headgear, which reduces the subjectivity of results. However, the sport's governing body has become almost obsessed with change, and much to the frustration of athletes the equipment has again been revised just months before Rio 2016. \"Changing it this close is a bit confusing,\" Sansum told BBC Sport. \"It's hard to score and you find people winning through penalties rather than kicks because the head guards are inconsistent, but whoever adapts the quickest has the best chance of winning.\" Muhammad added: \"Things keep changing and there's new stuff to be aware of, but I'm confident my style and technique will work.\" To say Cook v Muhammad was a bitter battle would be an understatement, with the London Olympian - who received hate mail during the appeals process - adamant his rival took the fight too far. There has been noticeable tension between the pair when they have fought since, but Muhammad insists his relationship with Sansum is completely different. \"This isn't like other rivalries I've had in the past - there's nothing but respect here,\" he said. \"It [pre-London 2012] was incredibly tough and no other athlete had to go through those circumstances, but it made me tougher mentally and I do try to take that into the ring.\" While Cook was outside of the British set-up, training with his own team before London 2012, Sansum believes Britain has benefited from having two leading -80kg fighters sparring with each another as part of the same programme pre-Rio. \"Our team has so much talent and with the strength in depth we're always pushing one another,\" he said. \"When you see someone like Lutalo lifting big in the gym, you want to go bigger. When he's kicking hard, that motivates you more.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Fight-offs could have been used to decide as many as three of the four British Taekwondo London Olympic places, but GB selectors are not great supporters of the idea. Muhammad leads Sansum 3-1 in the career head-to-head, but results against high-profile opponents will have a greater bearing on selection. \"I would do anything to get into the Olympics, but I'm not that big a fan of fight-offs,\" said Sansum, though Muhammad admits it \"would be a great watch\". With only one athlete per nation allowed to compete in each division at the Europeans, Muhammad and Sansum will be kept apart. Muhammad has the advantage of competing in the Olympic category on Saturday, with Sansum in -87kg action on Sunday, but results for both fighters will count significantly towards Rio selection.

{"article": "Experts at Sotheby's have described the manuscript as \"the most significant piece of rock material to appear at auction.\" Dylan wrote the song in pencil on four small sheets of hotel stationery in 1965. The manuscript features corrections, revisions and additions. Sotheby's say bids could reach Â£1m. Notes attached to the lyrics relate to the singer/songwriter's life at the time, with a reference to a club appearance by the American musician Joan Baez. There are doodles in the margin, including a rooster, a fedora hat and a high heeled shoe, as well as abstract shapes. Bob Dylan also experimented with alternative rhyming schemes for the \"How does it feel ...\" chorus. He tries out \"get down and kneel,\"  \"raw deal\" and \"shut up and deal.\" Richard Austin, head of books and manuscripts at Sotheby's, New York, said the manuscript reveals Dylan's \"method of composition\". \"You can see how much work he put into it.  There is a real feel of immediacy,\" he added. The song transformed Bob Dylan's career, from a folk singer to a rock star. It also changed the course of popular culture. \"Before the release of Like a Rolling Stone, music charts were overrun with short and sweet love songs, many clocking in at three minutes or less,\" said Mr Austin. \"By defying convention with six and a half minutes of dark, brooding poetry, Dylan rewrote the rules for pop music.\" And Dylan himself knew it was good. 'Rolling Stone's the best song I wrote,\" he said at the end of 1965. The manuscript is being sold by a Californian friend and business associate of Dylan, who bought it from the singer three years ago.

{"article": "The courts have detained at least 50 protesters, according to a local human rights organisation. The secretary general of the Organisation of American States (OAS) likened the country to a dictatorship. Government officials have not confirmed the arrests or the military processing of civilian suspects. Meanwhile, official figures show there has been a sharp rise in infant mortality and maternal death rates in the country as its economic crisis continues. \"The right and basic guarantees of due process no longer exist in Venezuela from the moment a civilian is forced to appear before a military court,\" said Luis Almagro, the Uruguayan head of the OAS, in a video statement on Monday. Venezuela announced its withdrawal from the OAS last month, accusing the US-based group of meddling in its affairs. President Nicolás Maduro said on Monday he planned to create a constitutional military assembly to deepen his revolution. He wants to involve the armed forces in his new citizen's assembly, which he says is needed to restore peace as the country deals with daily protests that have claimed more than 30 lives in recent weeks. His critics say the new assembly is being designed to neutralise the opposition-led legislature, the National Assembly. \"A regime that has violated the constitution in all of its fundamental principles.\" The words used by Luis Almagro were strong, but not nearly has strong as those used by anti-government protesters marching in Caracas on Monday. \"Dictator, murderer, repressor,\" is what they called Mr Maduro, as they demonstrated against the president's plan to create a citizens' assembly to draw up a new constitution. \"We don't need a new constitution, we need a new president,\" one woman said as her fellow demonstrators cheered. At a rival pro-government march, a speaker meanwhile tried to whip up enthusiasm for the citizens' assembly. Waving a copy of the constitution, he asked the crowd to \"give a cheer\" for articles 347 and 348, which give the Venezuelan people the power to change the constitution. The response was muted. Asked about the proposed changes, many struggled to explain why the constitution introduced under their beloved late leader, Hugo Chavez, needed changing. The National Assembly is meeting on Tuesday, alongside various non-government organisations, to discuss what they see as serious government repression. Citizen's meetings, arranged by the opposition groups, are also taking place across the country to discuss the proposed constitutional amendments. Alfredo Romero, a lawyer for Foro Penal, told AFP news agency military hearings involving civilians had been taking place for several days. \"So far, 75 people have been brought before Venezuelan military courts,\" he said. \"Fifty of those remain in custody.\" Foro Penal said they were being held in Guarico state, south of Caracas. In the first figures released since the start of Venezuela's economic crisis, which is fuelling opposition to the government, the health ministry said women dying in childbirth or within a month of giving birth had risen by 65%, while child deaths had climbed 30%. There has also been an increase in cases of illnesses such as malaria and diphtheria, which had been eradicated. Venezuela's acute shortage of almost all medicines has driven thousands to cross the country's borders in search of the drugs they need, while many doctors have emigrated, saying hospitals lack basic equipment.

{"article": "In recent years, countries like Mongolia and Uganda have been praised for making great strides in improving palliative care, which focuses on managing pain and discomfort caused by serious illnesses like cancer, HIV and strokes. In India, however, the situation is dismal. Most Indians who need palliative care simply don't get it and die in excruciating pain. Home to 1.3 billion people, India ranked 67 out of 80 countries in a study released last year comparing end-of-life care. The report considered the United Kingdom as the best place in the world to die. India faces major shortages in specialists, awareness and facilities. But the southern state of Kerala is an exception. It has more palliative care centres than the rest of the country put together and its extensive programme is bolstered by thousands of volunteers who give up their time to tend to those who are incurably ill, bedridden or nearing the end of their lives. Every week, people like Radha Upasarna assist specially trained physicians and nurses treating patients at home. They check for bedsores, deliver food, and often just listen and chat. Mrs Upasarna says what she does is not only a service to her community, but a way to overcome bouts of loneliness she has experienced after her husband's death in 2014. \"It doesn't feel like work,\" she said. \"It's just something I want to do.\" Care-givers say also what makes a huge difference is that morphine is available in Kerala's hospitals and at homes for patients who need it. Despite being the gold standard to treat severe pain, access to the opium-based drug has been highly restricted in India over fears of addiction and misuse. That means although India is the leading global producer of legal opium, almost all of it is exported to the West. In 2014, in what was seen as a major step forward, the parliament amended national law to simplify procedures for doctors to prescribe morphine, but it has so far had little impact on the ground, experts say. In Kerala, access is vastly better because the state changed its narcotic regulations almost 20 years ago. Zubair, 55, had a series of amputations to his right leg as treatment for a bone tumour. Due to the agonising pain he continues to suffer even after being cured, he has been taking morphine since 1994. MR Rajagopal, the doctor who first prescribed the painkiller to him, says he's an example of what morphine can do to a person even when a disease is not terminal. Dr Rajagopal estimates that 99% of Indians who need morphine don't get it and \"their lives are destroyed and they [often] take their own lives\". But for Zubair, who lives in the city of Kozhikode (formerly Calicut), \"morphine restored me back to life\". Although other states in India have largely failed to provide access to effective painkillers and palliative care, particularly in rural swathes, initiatives are slowly emerging outside of Kerala.

The Daily Mail said the ex-Monty Python member had become \"rueful - even, in the true sense of the word, pathetic\". The Alimony Tour - so-called because Cleese says it is funding a divorce - opened in Cambridge on Tuesday. Comedy website Chortle said Cleese was \"pleading penury\" and had been \"forced out on the road to scrape together a living when he'd rather be at home with a good book\". As such, it continued, there was \"a slight feeling that with the flagrantly money-making Alimony Tour that he's done just enough to get by\". It described the Corn Exchange gig as a straightforward re-telling of his rise to fame, full of anecdotes he had polished in interviews over the years. \"He hasn't even bothered to learn the script, reading his lines from a none-too-discreet autocue,\" its correspondent claims. The Independent's Julian Hall gave the show three stars out of five, saying fans of his classic sitcom Fawlty Towers were \"in for a treat\" because of clips that feature during the show. Yet The Times' Dominic Maxwell argued there were too many such clips, and \"too little of Cleese developing intriguing ideas about craft\". He gave the show two stars out of five, describing it as \"a lecture tour more than comedy tour\" that was more \"intelligent\" than \"wildly funny\". His sentiments were echoed by Quentin Letts in the Mail, who said his routine was \"initially funny\" but peaked after 20 minutes. \"The audience tries to jolly him along, but the fizz has evaporated,\" he wrote. \"Topical satire has yielded to autobiographical dribble.\" After his last Cambridge date on Saturday, Cleese will perform his show in several cities across the UK before closing the tour in Bath on 2 July.

{"article": "This morning Greece confirmed that it was sending a letter to the head of the Eurogroup, Jeroen Dijsselbloem. It was a formal request to extend the loan agreement by six months. The Greeks were offering significant concessions. They said they would refrain from taking any unilateral action that would undermine fiscal targets. They agreed that officials from the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - formerly called the troika - would supervise compliance with the deal. This was a significant step. Although the Greek prime minister has announced the troika as dead, officials from those institutions would still very much be active. Greece also pledged to meet its financial obligations to all creditors. The Greeks clearly expected that this would form the basis of a settlement. Shortly after they had sent the letter it was announced that eurozone finance ministers would meet in Brussels on Friday afternoon. The financial markets responded positively. They saw the meeting as a positive sign. Officials in Athens were briefing that they expected a deal Friday. Then, in Brussels, there was the usual midday briefing by the European Commission. The spokesman Margaritis Schinas revealed that Jean-Claude Juncker, the Commission President, had been involved in intense talks with the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Mr Juncker, we were told, \"sees in this letter a positive sign, which, in his assessment, could pave the way for a reasonable compromise in the interests of the financial stability in the euro area\". Brussels appeared to be giving its backing to the Greek letter. Less than an hour later there was another briefing in Berlin at the finance ministry in Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin. An official, speaking on behalf of the German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, said the Greek letter was \"not a substantial proposal for a solution\". He went on: \"In truth it aims at bridge financing, without meeting the requirements of the programme.\" For the Germans there is a point of principle here. They want Athens to stick to commitments made by the previous Greek government. Secondly, they fear that Greece will gradually weaken some of the austerity conditions that were at the heart of the existing bailout deal. Berlin wants cast-iron assurances that Greece won't rehire public sector workers, for example. So there is tension between Brussels and Berlin and mistrust between Berlin and Athens. Some in Greece are already angry, believing they are being asked to capitulate and their election result ignored. It may be difficult for the Tsipras government to concede more. All the time pressures are mounting. If there is no deal, the current bailout agreement will expire at the end of the month and Greece could run out of money shortly afterwards. Today the Italian Finance Minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned: \"We have to send a signal that the euro is irreversible. \"If a country were to leave, it wouldn't just mean one less country in the union but the transformation of the euro into a mechanism that can be undone.\"", "question": "After hours of fast - moving developments , a deal to settle the Greek bailout crisis hangs in the @placeholder .", "option_0": "wake", "option_1": "region", "option_2": "country", "option_3": "balance", "option_4": "world", "label": 3}

Etsy, which became a public company in 2015, has struggled to turn a profit. Competition has also mounted from other firms, including Amazon, which has launched its own handicraft market. The two rounds of layoffs total about 230, or roughly 22% of the firm's workforce at the end of 2016. Most of the cuts announced on Wednesday will come at the firm's Brooklyn headquarters, in positions such as marketing, product management and administration. Founded in 2005, Etsy employed about 1,000 people globally at the end of 2016 and had about 1.7 million active sellers. The company made $365m in revenue in 2016, but it has posted a loss every year since at least 2012, according to its annual report. At least one of its shareholders has pressured the firm to consider selling itself.

{"article": "Some people who do not believe they can pass the test - or those who simply want the UK driving licence document without the effort - are prepared to pay hundreds of pounds to cheat the system. And it is not just the practical test that falls prey to fraudsters; the theory examination has proved open to abuse. This risk to British roads is taken very seriously by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) and its team of 30 fraud investigators. Behind an unassuming smoked glass door in Nottingham the team's leader, Andy Rice, describes the problem of fraud as \"significant\" and \"serious\". He investigates driver impersonation - where stand-ins take tests in place of learners - illegal instructors who are not registered to teach, and corrupt translators who provide the correct answers in exchange for cash. \"Because of the sums involved some people will go to great lengths for this fraud,\" Mr Rice said. People will pay about £800 for someone else to take their theory test or about £1,600 to be impersonated in the practical test, he said. \"Gangs see it as a nice earner and when we started a gang could do 200 to 500 tests before they were caught.\" One of the first convictions involved an estimated £1m made in impersonations. Mr Rice said gangs \"employ\" eight to 10 people with \"different looks\" to match the learner's provisional licence photograph. Evidence of money laundering, drug and gun trafficking has been be found at the homes of arrested suspects, he said. Mr Rice managed the investigation that led last month to Britain's first jail sentence for an interpreter, who helped about 200 people to cheat the driving theory test. Chinese interpreter Peter Hui was sentenced to 12 months in prison for correcting answers in tests between 2011 and 2012 in Birmingham. A few weeks later Mandarin translator Allyson Ng was jailed for 12 months for cheating on at least 94 theory tests between 2009 and 2012, mainly in Cardiff. Although a rare fraud, with five translators prosecuted to date, its impact is significant: for each corrupt translator the number of people who pass with that person's help can be in the hundreds. In the first case of its kind, in 2004, an interpreter speaking Tigrinya (a language from Ethiopia and Eritrea) was shown to have given answers in 562 tests. His fraud was committed mainly in London and Birmingham. The Midlands has featured in all the cases where translators have been prosecuted for fraud. In February the government launched a consultation into ending foreign language assistance for the UK driving test. Road safety minister Stephen Hammond said, in addition to the possibility of fraud, allowing interpreters created a potential safety risk, due to people being able to pass the test but not understand important traffic updates. In July two examiners, an instructor and seven candidates were sentenced after a three-year investigation into fraud in Warwickshire. And cheating is not confined to the standard driving licence test. The DSA is investigating an Urdu translator suspected of helping bus and lorry drivers cheat on theory tests in the West Midlands. John Fothergill, former chairman of the Private Hire Drivers Association in Coventry, said cheating is well known to taxi drivers. Until he left five years ago he worked alongside the Taxi Licensing Department in the city. He said: \"I heard of people using mobile phones and sending text messages to get answers in the [taxi] written exams, some drivers definitely got through without all the knowledge they needed to do the job.\" Mr Rice said the public can help to tackle fraud by ensuring driving instructors are registered with the DSA, which ensures they are competent and checked. \"The best way to be assured learners are safe is to check the green DSA registration badge on the instructor's windscreen. \"Instructors are in a position of trust, a lot of learners are young adults and for those who operate illegally, without a CRB check, who knows what their background is,\" he added.", "question": "Driving tests are a fraught @placeholder for UK residents who want to drive legally on the nation 's roads - but they can also be a money - spinner for organised crime gangs .", "option_0": "trade", "option_1": "growing", "option_2": "necessity", "option_3": "destination", "option_4": "alert", "label": 2}

{"article": "They've today gone some way to answering that charge by recruiting some of the world's most influential left-wing economists to an advisory panel. The panel includes Joe Stiglitz, the US Nobel prize-winner, Simon Wren-Lewis, Mariana Mazzucato, Danny Blanchflower and Thomas Piketty. These are economists who've written powerfully about the need for new taxes, especially on the wealth of the rich (Piketty most famously) and on the role that governments can play in sparking wealth-creating innovation (a tour de force by Mazzucato). And they are all opponents of austerity, or public spending cuts in a recession (Wren-Lewis in particular has been waspish about Osbornomics). While their views are not shared by many economists of the centre and right, none are lightweight. Which means that for the first time perhaps since Margaret Thatcher became leader of the Tories, when she sought intellectual ballast for her policies of controlling the money supply and shrinking the state from the likes of Friedman and Hayek, a leading British party is trying to establish an economic ideology outside the mainstream. It means there will be a properly emotional debate between Labour and the Tories about how to maximise growth and prosperity. What is striking is that Labour under Blair, Brown and Miliband never set up an equivalent panel of distinguished and ideologically left-wing economists drawn from all over the world. It is also intriguing that Piketty is prepared to help Corbyn but has maintained a certain distance from the French socialist government of Francois Hollande. The composition of the panel probably also tells us that the ultra formulation of \"quantitative easing for people not banks\" - till now seen as the quintessence of Corbynomics - is dead. Or to put it another way, this group of economists would not sign up to a policy of the Bank of England providing cheap loans to a new state investment bank on a permanent continuous basis - for fear that the anti-inflationary credentials of the Bank of England would be destroyed. If People's QE survives - which it may - it will be as a contingent rainy-day monetary tool, for when the economy is next in direst straits. That said I would expect all these economists to back the notion of the government taking advantage of prevailing low interest rates to borrow considerably more for investment in infrastructure. Even so Mr McDonnell has chosen not to have a public punch up over the government's proposed bill to make it mandatory for the government's deficit to be closed. Labour will vote for the bill - while reserving the right in the next parliament to borrow whatever it thinks necessary for investment (as opposed to so-called \"current spending\" on the day-to-day bills of government departments).

Some joked that sporting fans complaining about rising match costs demonstrated \"Australian values\", while others poked fun at Australians' use of language and skill at making coffee.

Some used it to protest government policy over the ailing Great Barrier Reef, or Australia's tough policy of offshore detention for asylum seekers. There was also criticism of Australia's soaring house prices, a topic of much national discussion in recent weeks.

{"article": "While councils are recording greater numbers there is no way of knowing whether some of that reflects a better understanding of home educating families. Social media and access to a wide range of education material online may be making it easier for families to take on what is clearly a major commitment of time and energy. There is a strong tradition in some rural areas of families organising themselves to help their children learn at home. Others may arrive at the choice after an unhappy or difficult experience of their child not getting on well at school or not getting a place at their preferred school. We don't have definitive data on what happens to home educated children, but there is no reason to think they can't do as well academically or otherwise as children who go to school full time. That's partly because they are very likely to be the children of middle class, quite educated parents who are able to afford for one person to be at home. Although it is a minority choice, home education does reflect reservations many parents will experience at some point about whether their child fits completely into a very structured school system. Those reservations are not enough for the vast majority to ever step out of a system which is familiar, regulated and provides an immediate social network. Home education also provokes uneasiness because by its nature it is outside the system, an alternative choice. Local authorities have the power to intervene if there are concerns about a child's welfare, or ask for evidence if they are worried a suitable education isn't being provided. But from time to time there are calls for greater monitoring or regulation. The last major bout of this was in 2009 when the Badman review raised concerns that a lack of monitoring created opportunities for child abuse. Plans for registration were dropped in the last stages of the Labour government amid strong opposition from home educating families. Now another concern has emerged, that a small number of children may be at risk of being radicalised, or places in unregulated or illegal schools. A government consultation is underway now on further regulation of anywhere teaching children for more than six to eight hours a week.

Newcastle Crown Court was told the 24-year-old was caught after he boasted about his crimes on social media. The court heard disruption to BA's site cost the airline an estimated £100,000. Unemployed Dixon, from Seaham, was given a suspended two-year jail sentence and ordered to pay £200 after previously admitting five counts of unauthorised modification of computer material. Sarah Wood, prosecuting, told the court Dixon used Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which swamp a target website with an overwhelming stream of requests for access, causing the site to work very slowly or to shut down completely. The origin of such attacks is normally hard to trace, Recorder John Aitken was told, but Dixon gave the game away by tweeting about his exploits. Ms Wood said: \"He could not resist boasting about his activities online on his Twitter account. \"Indeed, this appears to be the sole motivation behind his actions.\" Dixon did not make any money from the premeditated hacks, the court heard. He went on hackers' forums and appealed for friends to name targets for him. The attack on British Airways happened on 26 October and lasted 68 minutes. Ms Wood added: \"While the website was not brought down, the traffic to the website was so great that legitimate customers would not have been able to access it either to make a booking or to check in.\" The airline said disruption to the website would have cost it approximately £100,000. Durham Police investigated and traced Dixon after searching Twitter for messages about the attacks. Sam Faulks, defending, said Dixon was \"not living in the real world\" and was at the time \"self-obsessed\", \"puerile\" and \"fairly isolated\".

He was arrested for sharing the profile, published by BBC Thai, two days after the new king ascended the throne in December 2016. Thailand has very strict lese-majeste laws, which ban any criticism of the country's monarchy. Mr Jatupat, an opponent of the military-backed government who has taken part in numerous protests, is the only person to be prosecuted over the article. He was one of more than 2,600 people to share the online profile of King Vajiralongkorn, 64. In December, Mr Jatupat was charged with defaming the monarchy and detained in north-eastern Thailand. The court in Khon Kaen later denied at least 10 requests for his release on bail. The student, who had initially contested the charges, agreed on Tuesday to plead guilty. He was facing up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Pleading guilty in lese-majeste cases can significantly reduce sentences in Thailand, where punishment can be severe; in June, one man was jailed for 35 years. The United Nations has joined human rights groups in criticising the heavy sentences imposed at lese-majeste trials, which have a conviction rate of more than 90% and are often held behind closed doors. Earlier this year, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights urged Thailand to amend its laws. Since the country's military coup in 2014, more than one hundred people have been charged with defaming the monarchy.

{"article": "This Syrian IS recruit initially joined an Islamist brigade of the Free Syrian Army to fight the Assad regime. He told the BBC that he went on to join IS when his whole tribe pledged allegiance to the group - and because he believed in creating an Islamic state. His first orders, as an Isis fighter, were to attend a course on Sharia, or Islamic law. \"Not the principles of Islam, the principles of the Islamic State. So they teach you the Islam they want,\" he said. \"It appeals to the heart and not to the mind, so that your heart becomes impassioned with their words. This is the first stage. The second stage is military exercises, military training.\" But he became disillusioned by the \"brutality\" of the extremists and escaped to Turkey. He summed up the jihadists' tactics like this: \"If you're against me, then you'll be killed. If you're with me, you work with me. You submit to my will and obey me, under my power in all matters.\" \"Anything that contradicts their beliefs is forbidden. Anyone who follows what they reject is an apostate and must be killed,\" he said. Usaid Barho was an ordinary Syrian teenager when civil war came to his hometown of Manjib, near Aleppo. At just 14, he was recruited by IS from a mosque in the town. He joined willingly, he told the New York Times. \"I believed in Islam,\" he said. \"They seduced us to join the caliphate,\" he said in an interview. \"They planted the idea in me that Shias are infidels and we had to kill them. He said he was told Shia militants would come to rape his mother if he did not fight. Being given a mission as a suicide bomber was the only way to escape, Usaid said, so he volunteered. Late last year, he approached the gate of a Shia mosque, unzipped his jacket to reveal a vest of explosives, and surrendered himself to the guards. \"I opened up my jacket and said, 'I have a suicide vest, but I don't want to blow myself up.' \" The guards removed the vest and Usaid was taken away an interviewed by intelligence officers. \"Even if he was brought to court, we would be on his side, because he saved lives,\" one of the officers said. Like thousands of others, Abu Ibrahim is a Westerner - it is not revealed from which country - who converted to Islam and was persuaded to travel to Syria by IS propaganda videos. But the reality did not match the high-production images he had witnessed online. \"A lot of people when they come, they have a lot of enthusiasm about what they've seen online or what they've seen on YouTube,\" he told CBS. \"They see it as something a lot grander than what the reality is. It's not all military parades or it's not all victories.\" During his six months with the militants he saw crucifixions and witnessed a couple being stoned to death for adultery. He escaped after realising he was not helping the people of Syria, he said. \"My main reason for leaving was that I felt that I wasn't doing what I had initially come for and that's to help in a humanitarian sense the people of Syria,\" he told me. \"It had become something else. So, therefore, no longer justified me being away from my family.\" But getting out was not easy, he said. \"The restrictions on leaving made it feel a bit like a prison ...

{"article": "Samples were taken from the artist's teeth, bones and nails in a four-hour operation, officials said. The exhumation followed a court order on behalf of a woman who says her mother had an affair with the painter. If she is proved right, she could assume part of the Dalí's estate, currently owned by the Spanish state. It may take weeks before the results of the tests are known. The surrealist painter, who died in 1989 at the age of 85, was buried in a crypt in a museum dedicated to his life and work in Figueres, in north-eastern Spain. A crowd gathered outside the museum to watch as police escorted the experts into the building on Thursday evening. The exhumation went ahead despite the objections of the local authorities and the foundation carrying Dalí's name, both of which claimed that not enough notice had been given ahead of the exhumation. María Pilar Abel Martínez, a tarot card reader who was born in 1956, says her mother had an affair with Dalí during the year before her birth. Her mother, Antonia, had worked for a family that spent time in Cadaqués, near the painter's home. Last month a Madrid judge ordered the exhumation to settle the claim. It is contested by the Dalí foundation, which manages the estate of the artist, who was not believed to have had any children. Her action is against the Spanish state, to which Dalí left his estate. Ms Martínez says her mother and paternal grandmother both told her at an early age that Dalí was her real father. But the claim has surprised many, including Ian Gibson, an Irish-born biographer of Dalí, who said that the notion of the artist having an affair that produced a child was \"absolutely impossible\". \"Dalí always boasted: 'I'm impotent, you've got to be impotent to be a great painter',\" the biographer said.

It found a \"market failure\" in available finance. The development bank, a first of its kind for part of the UK, could have a \"significant impact\" on small business. This is the third and final report by Dylan Jones-Evans, professor of entrepreneurship at the University of the West of England in Bristol, who led the expert panel set up by the Welsh government. Previous reports found that there was a gap of Â£500m a year between what businesses want to borrow and what banks are willing to lend. This followed the economic crisis that began in 2007 and reached its height a year later. The call for a development bank could spell the end of the road for the arms-length body, Finance Wales. Prof Jones-Evans says: \"The current solutions being provided by Finance Wales, as a subsidiary of the Welsh government, will not be able to fully address the challenges in closing the widening funding gap for SMEs in Wales.\" He suggests integrating a substantial amount of its functions which could be done by either merging or amalgamating it with the development bank. \"The government provision of access to finance is too important a priority to be left within the narrow remit of this institution that has failed to adapt sufficiently to changing market conditions, \" he adds. Ultimately, the future of Finance Wales will be decided by the Economy Minister Edwina Hart. Prof Jones-Evans's other reports also raised questions about how well Finance Wales, which is publicly funded, was performing in terms of getting money to businesses and helping grow the Welsh economy. Figures last year also revealed that investments in firms from Finance Wales' main European fund had only resulted in 20% of the jobs they were expected to create. Although it has helped many businesses with financial support it has been criticised for charging high interest rates. The organisation says its loans are risk-based so it charges high rates where the risk is high. Prof Jones-Evans says high street banks need to be encouraged to lend to firms with the development bank \"working with\" rather than \"crowding out\" the private finance sector. The development bank could bring together loans, grants and business advice in one place. At the moment, companies can access different loans through the UK government, the Welsh government and Finance Wales. This is a major development in how the Welsh government supports businesses.

{"article": "Computer simulations suggest the plesiosaur moved through the water like a penguin, using its front limbs as paddles and back limbs for steering. The creature's swimming gait has been a mystery since bones of the first known specimen were dug out of a Dorset cliff 200 years ago. The plesiosaur was discovered by the fossil hunter Mary Anning in 1821. At the time even the name dinosaur had not been invented. A scientific paper unveiling Anning's find a few years later raised the question of how the marine creature swam, given its unusual pairs of wing-like flippers. The debate has continued until today, with a computer simulation based on a Jurassic fossil specimen providing evidence in favour of penguin-like motion. Dr Adam Smith of Nottingham Natural History Museum, Wollaton Hall, worked on the study. He explained that palaeontologists were divided on whether the marine creature used its four limbs in a rowing action like the oars of a boat; a flight stroke similar to modern penguins and turtles; or some sort of combination of the two. \"Our study shows the up-and-down movement is more likely,\" he told BBC News. \"That's how turtles and penguins swim today. \"Penguins are literally flying through the water.\" The study, published in the scientific journal PLOS ONE, is based on a computer simulation of a Jurassic fossil from Germany. The fossil is unusual in being an almost complete skeleton with all four limbs preserved. It is smaller than many other members of the plesiosaur family, at about 3m long. The computer model shows the animal's hind limbs provided \"relatively weak thrust\", say Dr Smith and co-researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, US. \"We conclude that plesiosaurs were forelimb-dominated swimmers that used their hind limbs mainly for manoeuvrability and stability,\" they report. The plesiosaurs were predatory marine reptiles that lived at the time of the dinosaurs. They are unique in the animal kingdom for having two pairs of large wing-like flippers. Palaeobiology expert Dr David Martill of the University of Portsmouth said the new work suggested that in the small plesiosaur at least, the forelimbs did all the work. He said it remained to be seen if the same was true of the largest plesiosaurs, which were ferocious marine predators. \"These beasts probably fed by twist feeding like the large crocodiles of today,\" he said. \"If this were the case, then the hind limbs may have been used to spin the animal on its long axis.\" Follow Helen on Twitter.", "question": "Scientists have reconstructed how an ancient reptile swam in the @placeholder at the time of the dinosaurs .", "option_0": "oceans", "option_1": "world", "option_2": "county", "option_3": "space", "option_4": "country", "label": 0}

Anderson was also involved in a verbal altercation with India batsman Ajinkya Rahane at the end of the fourth day's play in Southampton, before umpire Rod Tucker stepped in to tell both players to calm down.

Northern Ireland have now gone 10 games unbeaten for the first time. Slovenia had a chance to equalise in the second half but veteran keeper Roy Carroll superbly saved Milivoje Novakovic's penalty. The 66th-minute spot-kick was awarded when West Brom defender Jonny Evans pulled back Miral Samardzic as a corner came into the area. Notts County keeper Carroll made another fine stop in the 89th minute to keep out a low shot by Valter Birsa. Washington, the former postman who was playing non-league football just over four years ago, earned his second cap after making his debut in Thursday's 1-1 draw in Wales. Boss Michael O'Neill has said the bulk of his squad will be made up by the players who got Northern Ireland to their first major finals for 30 years, so there are only a few places up for grabs by those on the periphery. But Washington has certainly put his hand up for inclusion. Those fans wondering why the match-shy Kyle Lafferty, their top scorer in qualifying, did not start forgot all about that when the hard-working Washington bulldozed his way through to finish well for the only goal of the night. Northern Ireland going 10 matches unbeaten is a nice record for O'Neill to reflect on but, from his perspective, the result mattered more because it keeps momentum going as the Euro 2016 finals edge closer. In their first tournament appearance in 30 years, Northern Ireland will face world champions Germany, Poland and Ukraine in the group stage. Thursday's draw in Cardiff and this slender victory maintain the feel-good factor ahead of the finals. It all breeds confidence and, if they can come through their final two warm-up games without losing, Northern Ireland can head to France in fine spirits. For spells, the match may have had the definite feel of a friendly, but it was a good workout for Northern Ireland. Striker Lafferty, now with Birmingham City on loan, came on in the second half to get some more game time. Peterborough United defender Michael Smith made his international debut at the age of 27 and did not look out of place with a composed performance. Competition for places is keen - there are going to be some disappointed men when O'Neill decides on his squad of 23. Northern Ireland have two friendlies left before the serious business of facing Poland in their opening Euro 2016 match on 12 June. O'Neill's men are back at Windsor Park to play Belarus on Friday, 27 May.

Coe said he would impose serious sanctions on any nation guilty of attempting to cover up drug-taking. Kenya is to be placed on a 'watch-list' of nations at risk of breaching Wada's code and could be banned from international competition if non-compliant, as happened with Russia's athletes. \"We know that a disproportionate amount of reputational damage is caused by a relatively few countries,\" he told BT Sport's The Clare Balding Show. \"If it means pulling them out of World Championships or Olympic Games then we will have to do that. \"I know the World Anti-Doping Agency has looked very closely at the Kenyan National Anti-Doping Agency.

Isaac Mwangi denies wrongdoing but wants to leave his post for 21 days while the claims are investigated by the IAAF. For several months, Wada has been trying to persuade Kenya to set up an effective national agency so more drug tests can be conducted, but progress has been slow.

But he refused to confirm the grant would be available for all Welsh students as it is now. Students from Wales currently only pay Â£3,810 towards their tuition fees, wherever they study in the UK. The rest, up to Â£5,190 a year, is paid for by the Welsh government. When asked whether the tuition fee grant would remain on a universal basis, Mr Lewis told Sunday Politics Wales: \"We'll have to see what the manifestos say about that. \"I think the central principle needs to be; we will invest in your ambition as a young person and we will not curtail your ambitions, particularly when it comes to geography. \"If you really think you're best served across the border or in Scotland or Northern Ireland that's okay. So we will stick with that principle.\" The policy means at the moment the Welsh government is the most generous to students of all parts of the UK. But universities have long argued that the grant means tens of millions of pounds leaves the higher education (HE) sector in Wales and goes to the coffers of their counterparts in England. And the Welsh Conservatives called the policy a \"irresponsible, unsustainable gimmick\". Shadow education minister Angela Burns said: \"The current subsidy is a runaway train that gathers piles of Welsh taxpayers' cash and dumps them in England. \"Welsh Conservatives would ensure those most in need of help received it - but we would not allow Labour's one billion pounds mistake to continue.\" Last year, the head of the body responsible for allocating funding to universities in Wales said the Welsh government needed to change how it funded students from Wales to avoid universities here falling behind their English counterparts. In 2013, BBC Wales revealed that the body representing universities here had concerns they were losing out compared to their counterparts in England because of the tuition fee grant. BBC Wales has also revealed concerns expressed by the finance directors of universities here that the grant left \"the sector with an uncertain financial future\" In November 2013, the Welsh government announced a review of HE funding and student finance arrangements in Wales, which is chaired by the Scottish academic Prof Ian Diamond. Prof Diamond will make some of his thoughts public later this year, with the full review expected to be published after the assembly elections. In his first interview since  announcing his intention to stand down in May, Mr Lewis said he would miss life as an assembly member. \"It's been a tremendous honour to represent the community where I was born and raised; and to have served as education minister, which in many ways has been my dream job,\" he said. \"I'll always walk a little taller with both those things in mind.

British number one Konta is now rated as the favourite with some bookmakers, and she faces Maria Sakkari of Greece on Court One at about 15:00. Heather Watson and Aljaz Bedene bolster the British challenge on day five. Rafael Nadal, Simona Halep and Venus Williams are among the other leading names on the schedule, with another warm, dry day forecast. Watson takes on two-time Grand Slam champion Victoria Azarenka, recently back on the tour after the birth of her son Leo, in the opening match on Centre Court at about 13:00. Bedene must counter the serve-and-volley skills of Luxembourg's Gilles Muller in the first match on court two at about 11:30. It is the first time since Tim Henman, Mark Petchey, Greg Rusedski, Andrew Richardson and Karen Cross made the third round in 1997 that at least four Britons have reached that stage. Two of Murray's more chastening defeats of recent years have come at the hands of Fognini, but this time the Scot has the surface and home advantage on his side. The pair, both 30, first played each other when they were 12 and share a 3-3 record as professionals. Fognini played superbly to beat Murray in the Davis Cup three years ago and at the Italian Open two months ago, but those contests were on the clay of Naples and Rome. \"If I play like that, could be interesting,\" said Fognini. The Italian has never been past the third round at Wimbledon and will make his Centre Court debut on Friday. \"Of course, he's the favourite,\" Fognini added. \"I know my game. I know how to play against him. We know each other really well. I'm ready.\" Murray said: \"He's always dangerous. He's a shot-maker and he's very solid off his forehand and backhand side, but he can also hit winners from both sides. \"He has good hands up at the net. He moves extremely well on the other surfaces. I don't know how well he moves on the grass.\" After a gripping three-hour win over Donna Vekic in the previous round, sixth seed Konta will hope for a quicker passage into the second week against Sakkari. The 21-year-old from Greece is ranked 101st and has made it through to the third round of a Grand Slam for only the second time. Konta, 26, thrilled the crowd in her first ever Centre Court win on Wednesday and gave further evidence that she could be a title contender. \"I guess I keep sounding like a broken record, but for me, pressure is a very self-imposed thing,\" said the Briton. \"I'm approaching this event like I am every other event. I'm coming here to do the best that I can, to compete the best I can.\" Watson is enjoying a real return to form after slipping outside the world's top 100 this year. The 25-year-old reached the semi-finals in Eastbourne last week, and thrashed 18th seed Anastasija Sevastova in round two. She is now one win away from reaching the second week of a Grand Slam for the first time. \"It's been one of my goals forever,\" said Watson. \"I made those big goals years ago. Making the second week of a Slam would be huge for me.\" Bedene, 27, is another player on the verge of breaking new ground by earning a fourth-round place at a Grand Slam tournament. The world number 58 lost to Muller at a grass-court tournament in the Netherlands last month, but it was three tight sets. \"He loves grass,\" said Bedene. \"He's won Hertogenbosch. He played semis at Queen's. He loves serve-and-volley play.

{"article": "MP Iain Wright told the BBC that Parliament should examine \"flex\" contracts, which allow some shifts to be extended by two hours or reduced. An employment lawyer said the contracts could breach employment legislation. XPO Logistics, which runs the warehouse on behalf of Asos, said it was \"fully compliant with employment law\". But the company has told workers it is making changes to some of its practices. Asos is one of the UK's biggest online fashion retailers and has more than nine million customers. Its warehouse in Grimethorpe, near Barnsley, employs about 4,000 workers, with those asked to \"pick\" items for distribution given a target of 160 items an hour, while the \"pack\" target is 170 items. Many of the staff who spoke to the BBC complained about the \"flexing\" clause, which operates on alternate weeks and is designed to cope with peak times and quiet periods. Emma Clark, a former team leader and single parent, said she struggled to find childcare when asked to \"flex up\" just before a shift. \"I don't drive - I'm reliant on public transport. The childminder couldn't always do it.\" She would sometimes have to take a taxi to her sister's house to drop her young daughter off. She said if she refused to flex up because of childcare commitments, she would be disciplined. \"They'd say that I'd go down as a late anyway. It would go against my review.\" Another worker, who asked not to be named, said she had been asked to do extra hours in the middle of a shift. \"I'd describe it as unpaid overtime. If we don't do it, we're disciplined. I've been up for disciplinaries for refusing to flex.\" A third worker said they had been flexed up at every opportunity in June and July, and were now owed payment or time off in lieu for 60 hours. Since our investigation began, workers have been told they will no longer be flexed up on the day. Staff have now been promised that all outstanding hours in the \"flex\" bank will be paid this month and in future unpaid \"flex\" hours will be settled at time and a half at the end of the financial year. In a response to our questions, XPO said staff were informed of \"flex\" shifts in February for the following financial year and it encouraged staff \"struggling with childcare arrangements to raise any issues\". The company said staff had only been asked to flex up on the day of their shift three times since April. It said flex bank hours were offset as soon as was \"reasonably possible\" and workers could now request to be flexed down. It said that \"persistent non-attendance for flex hours may result in disciplinary action\" but no-one had been sacked \"as a result of a failure to attend a 'flex' shift\". It added that employees were paid the same amount each month, irrespective of whether they worked more or less than their contracted hours. This practice is known as an \"annualised contract\". But employment lawyer Zoe Lagadec said it meant the company could be breaching employment legislation. She believes the additional hours worked should be regarded as part of a \"time work\" contract, which legally requires payments within 31 days. \"They should be reconciled during the National Minimum Wage reference period which can't go beyond a month.\" XPO said all employees were paid \"no less than the National Minimum Wage\" and it was \"fully compliant with employment law\". Iain Wright, who chairs the Commons Business, Innovations and Skills Select Committee, said flex contracts needed to be examined over their legality. \"They need to be tested in a court of law in terms of whether the legal process is robust enough. \"If I'm a manager and asking you to flex up and giving you a notice period of minutes or hours and then not reconciling the work done and the pay given for something like 10 or 11 months, that's exploitation, that's abuse.\" He said he wanted to question company bosses over flex contracts. \"I also want government to answer that question - how is that allowed in law? And whether Parliament now has to change the law to address that.\" The GMB union, which represents workers at the Grimethorpe warehouse, has called on Asos to do \"far better\" to address concerns over working practices at the site. Regional secretary Neil Derrick said: \"This is about respect and dignity for workers.

{"article": "David Hyde, a 22-year-old from New Zealand, was delighted when he was accepted as an intern with a UN agency. He had hoped for a paid position, because, he says: \"I think my work does have a value.\" But he was happy to take the UN offer because of the prestige attached to working for such a renowned organisation. He admits that, during the interview process, the UN told him quite clearly that Geneva was an expensive town, and wanted reassurances that he would be able to fund his internship himself. \"I guess my budget was not realistic in the end,\" he says. \"It was way more expensive than I imagined. I thought I could find a really budget way to live, but to be honest I've ended up living in a tent.\" He is, he says, not keen to be seen as a victim, and points out that camping on the shores of Lake Geneva during the summer months is not actually \"all that bad\". He had not spent too many nights there before he was noticed, and soon his story was on the front pages of the Geneva newspapers. Genevans were shocked that the famous and much-loved institution should be connected to such a case. But inside the United Nations itself, there was little astonishment. \"It doesn't surprise me at all,\" says Sabine Matsheka from Botswana. Sabine is chair of the Geneva Interns Association. \"We get desperate calls and emails from interns asking for couches, air mattresses, just a place to stay.\" Sabine, who is interning with the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), says she too has had difficulty making ends meet. \"The unpaid element has influenced my internship,\" she says. \"I had to plan very carefully with my funds and that's why I had to stick to three months because that is what I could be supported by my family and my own funds. \"I wish I could stay longer.\" UN officials have been taken aback by the huge attention now being paid to David's case. \"Interns get a lot of experience,\" says Ahmad Fawzi, head of the UN's information service in Geneva. \"First-hand knowledge about how the international system works: it's invaluable for them, and they have fun.\" Mr Fawzi also points out that the policy of not paying interns comes not from the UN agencies themselves, but from the UN General Assembly which, some years ago, passed a resolution allowing the recruitment of interns, but prohibiting their payment. And, he insists, the UN does its best to offer a few perks, negotiating cheaper rates for interns on Geneva's public transport system, and offering discounts at the UN cafeteria. Those, however, will hardly compensate for the sky-high rents which confronted David when he arrived. \"I feel this young man may not have done his research,\" says Mr Fawzi. Unpaid internships are commonplace these days, and they can be good experience for young people hoping to gain experience in a possible future career field. But Ian Richards, who heads the UN staff trade union in Geneva, believes the United Nations is the one organisation that should not be using unpaid labour, however valuable the experience. \"It does make this organisation look terrible,\" he says. \"Here's the United Nations, it's supposed to set the standards when it comes to labour standards, reaching out to the young, reaching out to people in developing countries, and it doesn't seem to be able to do that.\" What's more, he points out, UN agencies employing unpaid interns are in danger of violating the very principles, such as the abolition of slave labour, which they exist to promote. \"A few years ago at the International Labour Organisation, they found an intern sleeping in the basement,\" he remembers. \"That created a lot of noise in the press and, as a result, the ILO decided to pay its interns.\" Meanwhile Sabine Matsheka points that continuing with the policy of unpaid interns simply ensures that only candidates with personal funds can apply. At the moment, of the 34 interns in Sabine's section alone, she is one of just two from Africa. \"I am from a developing country,\" says Sabine, \"and I know of many people from my university who would have loved this opportunity but could probably not afford to do it.\" But if the ILO can find a way to get around General Assembly rules and pay its interns, surely other UN agencies can do the same? As ever with UN bureaucracy, it is not quite as simple as that. All agencies attached to the UN Secretariat, among them OCHA, UN Human Rights, and the UN Conference on Trade and Development, remain bound by that old General Assembly vote forbidding the payment of interns. \"I personally, everyone here agrees,\" says Ahmed Fawzi. \"They should be paid. \"But the only way to change it is for a member state to draft a resolution and submit it to the General Assembly and put it to the vote. I have no doubts it would be accepted immediately. \"It's not up to us, the civil servants, it's up to member states to change the rules.\" Drafting, adopting and introducing UN policy can, as with any legislative body, take years. So any change will not affect today's interns, and certainly not David, who is now rolling up his tent. The expense of Geneva, the unpaid status, and now the pressure of media attention have all been too much and he has decided to resign, although he is keen to stress that his UN colleagues in Geneva are not to blame. \"The United Nations has done nothing to try to stop me talking about this subject,\" he says. \"They have been nothing but supportive, they don't want to see me in this situation. But on a structural level, there is a kind of missing link in terms of support. \"I'm not sure what I'll do moving forward.\"", "question": "The case of a United Nations intern found sleeping in a tent on the shores of Lake Geneva has drawn attention to the United Nations practice ( one it shares with big business and some European Union institutions ) of employing interns on an unpaid @placeholder .", "option_0": "impoverished", "option_1": "charm", "option_2": "basis", "option_3": "beach", "option_4": "footing", "label": 2}

He was diagnosed with cancer in January 2012, shortly after returning from commentating duties in the United Arab Emirates. Martin-Jenkins' Test Match Special colleague and friend, current BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew, was among those who paid tribute to the journalist. \"CMJ, as he was widely known, was one of cricket's most respected writers and broadcasters,\" said Agnew. CMJ was one of the voices of the English summer \"With modern media now preferring the views and experiences of former Test match cricketers, Christopher's authority and respect was not gained from a high-profile playing career, but a deep-rooted love of the game linked to a strong protective instinct which helped him earn the most coveted position of president of the MCC [Marylebone Cricket Club]. \"Listeners to Test Match Special were all too familiar with CMJ's eccentricities - like going to the wrong ground for the start of a Test match.

{"article": "Fast forward to present day: now, the Philippines wants Chinese cash. What happened? Well in part there is a genuine dilemma here for the Philippines. It's a small island country, stuck on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific, surrounded by much larger, powerful nations. The Philippines' main source of income and military assistance has been from its former colonial masters, the United States. It also has a large population to find jobs for, and urgent infrastructure projects to fund, none of which it can do on its own. So the Philippines is left playing a hedging game between the US and China - the world's old superpower and the new. Despite competing claims in the South China Sea, Manila is now softening its stance in a bid to woo investment from Beijing. \"At this point it is very important for us to build confidence in each other,\" Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez told me in an interview in Singapore. \"We are not abandoning any claims [in the SCS] but the President thinks that this is the time to be more friendly rather than contentious.\" But it wasn't always such a cordial relationship. As recently as 2014, Chinese investment into the Philippines was worth a paltry US$42m, a fraction of what Beijing has invested in the rest of the South East Asian region - in part due to the suspicion many in Manila had over Beijing's motivations. The new-found friendship that has blossomed under President Rodrigo Duterte is no doubt helped in part by the massive chequebook China has to finance the loans he needs to implement his \"build, build, build\" policy that is expected to cost US$180bn over the next six years. As part of this new strategy, Secretary Dominguez also told me that the Philippines is launching a US$200m bond issue to China for the first time in October, to try and tap investment in the country. But investment from China never comes without strings attached, I pointed out to him - and the list of Asian countries that have taken loans from Beijing only to find themselves unable to pay these debts back is growing fast. Is the Philippines next? Secretary Dominguez was quick to dismiss such concerns. \"We think Chinese loans can be beneficial to us, particularly if we negotiate them in a clever manner,\" he told me. \"Nobody is forcing it down our throats.\" It's an argument I've heard from many Asian officials who privately have told me that the money from Beijing is too good to ignore, and are convinced that they will be able to exploit the relationship to their own advantage. But it's also a dangerous path to tread. \"There are a lot of cautionary tales around the region of countries that come out on the losing end,\" Maria Ressa, chief executive of the Rappler website and long-time Philippines observer told me. \"The Duterte administration acknowledges that we are weaker, but that we also have something to offer China. They're trying something new - but are they really as clever as they say they are? We will have to wait and see.\" For now though, it does look like China has the upper hand. Beijing's One Belt One Road initiative, a massive infrastructure project across most of the world  has also convinced many Asian partners that China's interest in them is for the long term. Meanwhile, increasingly Asian countries feel that their traditional ally, the US, has become unreliable since Mr Trump was elected. Even if they won't say it publicly, the shift in economic and business strategy is revealing. \"Our business with the US will continue, but not be as big a part of the economy as the past,\" Secretary Dominguez told me. \"We used to have only American cars in the sixtiesâ€¦.now we are seeing Chinese motorcycles. We have to move with the times.\" China's cash may come with its own set of unique complications but the view from here is at least it's paying attention to what Asia needs.", "question": "Two years ago the Philippines was entrenched in the bitterest of disputes with regional giant China , bringing a David v Goliath - style @placeholder against it over the South China Sea islands .", "option_0": "case", "option_1": "sets", "option_2": "display", "option_3": "action", "option_4": "pitted", "label": 0}

{"article": "In cafes and workplaces all over the UK, you will hear Italians talking about food and football, but also about Italy's pivotal 4 December referendum on constitutional reform. More Italians are believed to have moved to the UK than any other European country in 2015; 600,000 are now estimated by the Italian consulate to live in the UK. More Italians live in London than any other city in the world, except Buenos Aires. They may play a key role in Italy's vote, and that is why leading Italian politicians have been flying to the UK to try to win expat votes. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi says the reforms he's proposing are the best way for Italy to kick-start its economy - by streamlining decision-making and cutting red tape and public spending. But his critics say the changes will give him too much power and are a diversion from more urgent problems, such as corruption, unemployment and poor economic growth. The stakes are high. Mr Renzi says he will step down as prime minister if he loses the referendum, prompting the anti-government Five-Star Movement to characterise the referendum as a vote of no-confidence in his premiership. It could become the Italian equivalent of David Cameron's gamble on the Brexit referendum. If the prime minister does lose, there could be calls for a general election, which his supporters warn could plunge Italy into dangerous instability. In previous votes, less than a third of Italians abroad used their vote - so politicians have been trying to get the vote out. 600,000 Estimated population according to Italian consulate 292,000  Officially registered by Italy as residents abroad 55% Increase in residents registered since January 2011 44% Aged between 18 and 40 Mr Renzi sent his minister for reforms, Maria Elena Boschi, to London along with another five politicians from the Yes campaign (##BastaUnSiUK). The No campaign (#IoDicoNo) is led by Italy's biggest opposition party, the Five-Star Movement. It flew over one of its senior representatives, Luigi Di Maio, along with three more speakers from the No campaign. At the heart of the referendum are proposals to rewrite a third of the Italian constitution and reduce the size and power of the second chamber of parliament. At the moment the two houses - the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies - are just about equal. The referendum proposals would cut the number of senators from 315 to 100 and strip the Senate of the right to hold votes of no-confidence in the government. Reformists say this would cut the cost of politics by €500m (£430m; $530m) a year and speed up lawmaking by ending decades of parliamentary ping pong. Date: Sunday 4 December, but Italians voting by postal ballot in the UK need to make sure ballots reach the Italian Consulate by 1 December Who can vote?

Yes-campaign group \"AperiSì\" has been meeting weekly in London and eight other cities. They take their name from the Italian custom of \"Aperitivo\", a pre-dinner event popular among young people. One of the London organisers, Gianluca Failla - a 30-year-old social worker originally from Palermo - believes Mr Renzi's reforms will improve politics in Italy. \"I studied International Relations in London, and I had to face ridicule each time I spoke about my country. I don't want this reputation any more. We are a laughing stock,\" he complains. He also thinks a Yes vote would help him personally. \"It will be easier for Italy to approve laws to allow gay couples to adopt,\" he says. \"Politicians avoid dealing with controversial legislation by letting the two chambers ping pong the law between them to delay a decision. I hope that finally this law can pass and I will feel like I have the same rights other Italians do.\" Make-up company employee Alessandra Ciarno, 33, is yet to decide how to vote. \"I would like to be more informed about the referendum before making a choice,\" she explains.

Six decades on, the goat greets visitors to the Tate's new show, still apparently oblivious to the car tyre which has somehow wedged around its middle. Also in 1955 the artist created Bed, a characteristic Rauschenberg \"combine\". Taking a pillow, a sheet and a quilt he merged them with a traditional oil-painting.

Walking around Tate Modern's retrospective of the work of Rauschenberg (1925 - 2008) these are not the only cases where you think: \"He got there first.\" Rauschenberg was Texan and was born into a family with a deep Christian faith. At 18 he was drafted into the US Navy and served as a medical orderly. Post-war he went to Paris to study art but disliked it. \"Right place, wrong time,\" he observed. He returned to America. He was gay but nonetheless was married to a woman for three years from 1950. David White is senior curator at the Rauschenberg Foundation. He's in London for the new show, which next May will travel to New York. \"In 1965 when I first met Bob you immediately saw he was outgoing and open and convivial.  He was always very serious about work but light-hearted in his engagement with other people. \"At the same time he was concerned about the human condition and wanted to help right wrongs.  But unlike some artists he was full of enthusiasm rather than gloom.\" White adds: \"In 1964 he had won at the Venice Biennale - so he was aware he was esteemed. He was entering the mid-part of his career and finally making money. \"But he still had a long road to travel and so much to explore.\" White points out a huge and extraordinary piece from 1966 called Mud Muse. A metal and glass tank, roughly three metres by four, is filled with soft bentonite clay which bubbles and pops as compressed air passes through. White says it's a good example of how Rauschenberg liked to work. \"Bob genuinely loved collaboration.  It might be with another artist or with people in the theatre or with a choreographer like Merce Cunningham - but with Mud Muse he collaborated with a bunch of engineers to produce something unique. It's serious art - but also it's a comic, delightful, playful object.\" White can see why some pieces in the show get Rauschenberg labelled as part of pop art - pieces such as Triathlon or the well-known Retroactive II, which uses an image of President John F Kennedy and, like many Rauschenberg images, came from a magazine or newspaper. \"But the label's really not accurate. Bob came after abstract expressionism, which had dominated American art after World War Two and he provides a partial link from there to pop art. He was his own artist.\" The curator of the exhibition for the Tate is Achim Borchardt-Hume. \"In many ways the turning-point for Robert was after Paris at Black Mountain College (near Asheville in North Carolina). Black Mountain was a true laboratory - students were encouraged to work across many different disciplines.  I suspect the parties were as important as classes - but there was also a very strong sense of discipline and of working out what you were good at,\" says Borchardt-Hume. \"In terms of race or gender or sexuality or religion it was a wonderful mix of everything. And that's extraordinary given that at the time the area beyond the college was highly segregated.\" When Rauschenberg moved to a studio in Fulton Street in Lower Manhattan he had little money. \"What he shared with the abstract expressionists was their ambition and heroic scale. So though he was younger than them, there's certainly a link,\" Borchardt-Hume says. \"But he was never happy working in a single medium - there was almost nothing he wouldn't try. \"When he was young he had been very shy and always felt he was a disappointment to his father. His sexuality must have been difficult, given his family background. \"It seems his first relief from shyness was to go dancing. Marriage came early and it failed. But it produced a son, Christopher - now a photographer - and he remained friends with his wife Susan Weil. \"Robert Rauschenberg was rather a political artist. Don't forget that he became a well-known name in the Sixties, with America changing around him. So his work often contains - quite literally - images from news magazines. They might be of Martin Luther King or an Army helicopter but they're redolent of the America he knew.\" He adds: \"He thought that to be an artist was to play a role in the world.  That and his early shyness may be why he was unusually keen on collaborating: he didn't believe being an artist meant leading a life of isolation.\" Borchardt-Hume says there are huge riches on display in the exhibition. But he's happy if the image of the Goat in the Tyre dominates how some visitors react. \"It's one of those extraordinary moments where you think, 'how on earth did an artist arrive at this idea?'. Now, with everything that has happened in art since, we think it's quite all right. But I think at the time it must have seemed truly shocking.\" The Robert Rauschenberg exhibition runs at Tate Modern until 2 April and then at MoMA in New York from 21 May 2017.

{"article": "The number of complaints about payday lenders more than tripled to 4,186 in the first half of the year compared with the previous six months. The Financial Ombudsman, which compiled the figures, said borrowers had become more aware of their rights. The payday industry said that a falling proportion of complaints were upheld. The numbers are still dwarfed by PPI complaints, which totalled 91,381 in the six months to June, accounting for 54% of new cases considered by the ombudsman. There were 169,132 new cases on the books of the ombudsman in the first half of the year. They relate to a range of consumer complaints about banks, insurers and other financial businesses. This was a 3% rise on the previous six months. The ombudsman only deals with disputes that cannot be resolved between a consumer and a financial institution, so only reflects a fraction of the total number of unhappy customers. It found in consumers' favour in just under half (48%) of cases completed in the first half of the year. The figures show that payday lending was one area in which complaints had risen in the first half of the year, up from 1,213 in the previous six months. Some 53% of payday complaints were upheld. The ombudsman said the rise was partly due to greater consumer awareness of their rights. The Consumer Finance Association, which represents some of the major payday providers, claimed most customers felt they were treated better by payday operators than by other types of lenders. Russell Hamblin-Boone, the association's chief executive, said: \"We are obviously disappointed with the number of complaints, but this must be viewed in perspective. Of around a million loans funded there were about 2,000 upheld complaints. \"The true picture is represented by a recent customer satisfaction survey by Smart Money People, which showed that 95% of short-term credit customers felt they were treated fairly against an average of 88% of all credit customers.\" PPI complaints - made by those who felt they had been mis-sold the loan insurance - fell slightly compared to the second half of 2015, continuing a trend. Chief financial ombudsman Caroline Wayman said that PPI still weighed heavily on the organisation's workload. \"Although it is a few years now since PPI complaints peaked, we have been receiving over 3,000 a week for six years running - despite wider expectations that numbers will fall,\" she said. \"We are continuing to deal with the issues and uncertainties around PPI which remain a significant challenge for everyone involved.\" PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if the policyholder fell ill or lost their job. About 45 million policies were sold over the course of 20 years from 1990. However, it became clear that it was mis-sold on an industrial scale to people who didn't want or need it - or would not be eligible to claim. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) wants to set a June 2019 deadline for people to make claims over mis-sold PPI. Banks have so far paid out Â£24bn in compensation. The UK's five biggest banks have set aside Â£32.6bn to deal with the total compensation bill. This is the major reason why the largest number of complaints made to the ombudsman in the first six months of the year was about Lloyds Banking Group. The Bank of Scotland and Barclays were next on the list.", "question": "Payday loan complaints have risen sharply but the list of gripes about financial products is still dominated by payment @placeholder insurance ( PPI ) .", "option_0": "group", "option_1": "generating", "option_2": "protection", "option_3": "data", "option_4": "suspected", "label": 2}
{"article": "Her sisters believe the Army should have done more to protect her. \"Anne-Marie was begging for help and support and no-one listened to her,\" says Khristina Swain. Her other sister, Sharon Hardy, said the family were completely shocked when they were told their \"happy, confident and bubbly\" sister had taken her own life. \"We had no idea she was in such a very dark state of depression, but somebody in the Army would have known about that,\" she said. Cpl Ellement had alleged she was raped by two soldiers while drunk during a posting in Germany in 2009. The 30-year-old, from Bournemouth, alleged she was then bullied by other female soldiers. She was found hanged at Bulford Barracks near Salisbury, Wiltshire, in October 2011. Ms Swain described how her sister had hoped to travel to Arizona and had long-term plans to become a paramedic. \"We've read her diaries - she was a private person and the last thing she wanted to do was worry her family,\" she added. \"What upsets us now as a family is that if we had known, we could have helped.\" She added: \"She felt so isolated - she felt she couldn't go to the canteen, she was stuck in her room. She didn't get any support at all.\" The sisters maintain she was also \"constantly drained\" from excessive hours at work and was frequently called in on her days off. Mrs Hardy said that after Cpl Ellement sought medical help for depression, information should have been more effectively shared with other units by her superiors and the family should have been made aware of the extent of her mental health problems. \"They didn't take it seriously - nobody seemed to want to take any ownership,\" she said. During the inquest, Mrs Hardy said her sister \"could not believe\" that the two men she said had attacked her would not be charged. \"She was 110% certain what had happened to her,\" she added. A first inquest in March 2012 recorded a verdict of suicide. A new inquest was later ordered by the High Court after her sisters argued the initial hearing did not look at the rape or bullying allegations in any depth. The RAF Police, supported by the civilian Bedfordshire police force, is currently conducting a fresh probe into the rape allegations. The second inquest was told that Cpl Ellement's colleagues had openly discussed the rape allegation. A female soldier, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denied calling her a \"liar\" and a \"slag\" and insisted there was no co-ordinated campaign against her. Human Rights organisation Liberty, which represented Cpl Ellement's family, has launched a wider Military Justice campaign. It said the system had \"failed\" and raised questions over the Royal Military Police's investigation into the alleged rape. Calling for an independent ombudsman, Emma Norton from Liberty previously said: \"Only independent oversight of military investigations and greater civilian involvement will help ensure this never happens again.\" The Service Complaints Commission (SCC) was set up to oversee complaints of discrimination and harassment after the deaths of four soldiers at Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, Surrey. It has repeatedly concluded procedures are not working \"efficiently, effectively or fairly\". Its 2012 report said service personnel frequently have to wait for a year to have problems resolved. In 2012, 525 new complaints were made to the Army, an increase of 7% from 2011. SCC Commissioner Dr Susan Atkins advocates her office being replaced by that of a military ombudsman to \"more effectively hold the services to account for the just and fair treatment of personnel\". Retired Colonel Peter Walton, board member of the UK National Defence Association which campaigns on armed forces issues, described Cpl Ellement's death as \"an absolute tragedy\". However, he dismissed the idea of an independent ombudsman, which he said could undermine military discipline. \"You can't have interference from different places - you have to accept that where people's lives are at risk, the buck has to stop with the commanding officer. \"The fact is the pressures on a young recruit can be very powerful. You need to have a system of discipline supported by good people in command who can spot where a problem is evolving and take steps to deal with it.\" He rejected the idea of a bullying culture within the armed forces. \"You can't go ahead with people being bullied into doing things. I'm not saying bullies don't exist. Sometimes the worst bullies in peacetime turn out to be the best soldiers - its a judgement on how you deal with that and that's why you need an effective commanding officer.\" Last year the House of Commons defence committee found personnel were reluctant to make complaints about their superior officers. A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesman said it had a \"a zero tolerance approach to all forms of bullying, discrimination and abuse\". \"Any allegation of rape is taken extremely seriously, thoroughly investigated and appropriate action will be taken. \"We recognise that it takes great courage for any individual to come forward and report a sexual offence,\" he added. He said the MoD had worked to improve service personnel's knowledge of how to report concerns and what support is available. For Ms Swain, the inquest is a chance to offer hope to other service personnel. \"Anne-Marie was begging for help and support and no-one listened to her. If one person had listened to her, my sister would be here today. \"I'm hoping no other family will have to go through this.\"", "question": "A second inquest into the death of Cpl Anne - Marie Ellement , who was found hanged , has found the @placeholder of an alleged rape by two serviceman and bullying by colleagues were factors in her taking her own life .", "option_0": "freedom", "option_1": "subject", "option_2": "effect", "option_3": "birth", "option_4": "heart", "label": 2}
{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Before the tour party departed for New Zealand, I thought the All Blacks would win comfortably. But then I considered South Africa and Australia's decline since the last Rugby World Cup, that England and Ireland have both risen in the rankings, that Scotland beat the Wallabies in Sydney last week, and thought the balance of power was shifting from southern to northern hemisphere rugby. I looked at the considerable strength and quality of the squad at Warren Gatland's disposal. Then I added in some weather forecasts that suggested there might be favourable conditions for the Lions forwards at Eden Park. And maybe I got carried away. In the opening three minutes, you saw Jonathan Davies go through, offload to Conor Murray and the Lions come up to within a metre. From there, the All Blacks score. But the Lions didn't. Instead Elliot Daly was bundled into touch by a superb bit of defence from Israel Dagg and that set the tone for the game. New Zealand's players have an individual skill set far above any of their rival teams. Take second row Brodie Retallick, who is 6ft 8 and 19 and a half stone. He can push in the scrum and jump in the line-out in his sleep. When he wakes up though, he plays with the distribution and space awareness of a centre. From one to 15, they all have the X-factor. But as well as the ability to execute remarkable handling skills, they also have an understanding of how best to deploy them. Wing Rieko Ioane's first try was a case in point. The All Blacks had the penalty advantage after a great scrum, but Kieran Read was not only able to scoop an extraordinary off-load off the floor to scrum-half Aaron Smith, but also to realise that, with the Lions pack wheeled, he was opening up the tourists' weak side. Three passes later Ioane was in. They were the eye-catching moments. In general play though, their superiority sprung from a simple aspect of the game that is taught all the way from mini-rugby as a child. They were coming onto the ball at pace. Or if not, they passed to someone who could. It meant that they made yards to gain territory, it gave them the upper hand in the breakdown to secure possession and opened up the options of off-loads from which they create try-scoring chances. The hosts won the collisions. It was especially important given New Zealand attacked with less width than normal to try and avoid being trapped by a Lions rush that comes up quicker on the outside. After the match, Gatland called for his men to be more physical, while counterpart Steve Hansen mocked the Lions' presumptions of front-five dominance. Both coaches knew that basic truth. The beautiful aspect of rugby is that through cohesion, organisation and commitment you can negate a team of more talented individuals and win through the collective. The Lions will have come off the pitch at Eden Park thinking about what might have been because they had the opportunities to make the result very different. They created plenty of chances from long range, one was finished by Sean O'Brien for a spectacular try after Liam Williams' deft sidestep inside his own 22m. If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app please click here to vote. But others were left unexploited. Daly came close early on and could have put Liam Williams in after collecting Owen Farrell's kick on the half hour. Jonathan Davies' break should have delivered at least five points at the start of the second half before Anthony Watson's weaving run had the All Blacks stretched, but ultimately unbreached. Rhys Webb's try in the last play of the game may have been meaningless in terms of this weekend, but it was an important psychological blow. Whether it is the first minute or the last, the All Blacks hate conceding. If the Lions finished off what they created, they could have won this game and that is their glimmer of hope. The All Blacks always seem to come on strong in the final 20 minutes. The Lions need to be leading rather than chasing as the second Test heads into that decisive period. I would go for younger, more athletic, options from the start. Starting Maro Itoje ahead of Alun Wyn Jones in the second row would be the most obvious way to increase the dynamism of the side. The 22-year-old England lock is an 80-minute animal and made an impact after coming off the bench with a fine line-out steal and several good cover tackles. Webb's try was a fine piece of opportunism and fellow scrum-half Conor Murray had a couple of wayward kicks, but I would ignore calls for the Welshman to come in from the start. Webb is a finisher, revelling in the open spaces and tired defences late on, but is too much of an individual to start. However, I would have a long think about possibly replacing Owen Farrell, who lacked his usual influence, with Johnny Sexton at 10. Farrell didn't play badly, but his positive contribution was not that obvious either. He missed a kick that by his own high standards was eminently makeable. Perhaps bringing CJ Stander in ahead of Sam Warburton on the bench would bring more physicality and ball-carry ballast. Maybe Iain Henderson could come in to the 23 as a replacement. There are not too many changes to make. Ultimately, whoever you put out, you are up against the All Blacks, who are just a phenomenal team.", "question": "I had so many @placeholder coming into this game .", "option_0": "emotions", "option_1": "swept", "option_2": "breezed", "option_3": "dominated", "option_4": "edged", "label": 0}

{"article": "With more than two million people signing a petition calling for a second referendum - and the hashtag #wearethe48 trending on Saturday - Leave voters give their reaction and share their thoughts after voting to take the UK out of the EU. I voted to leave the EU but the result was, frankly, a surprise to me, as it was for many people. I am very pro-Europe and the UK is still part of Europe but the EU today bears little or no resemblance to the one I voted for many years ago. It has not matured and its ideology is flawed. The UK has had very little influence on the decisions taken in the EU and the laws and sovereignty of this country have been eroded and threatened. I expect the British parliament to be accountable to the voting population to carry out their promises and policies and that is our democracy. If the government do not do this, they can be voted out and replaced. We do not need the approval of the EU to govern our country. Our government needs to appoint the best negotiators to carry out the exit process and stabilise the current uncertainty. Bickering about the result is pointless and undemocratic in the political arena. The UK population needs to pull together now. The democratic process is over. We need to show others in Europe that huge reforms in the EU are necessary if it is to continue. I voted for membership of the European Economic Community 40 years. I voted for what I thought was free trade between the UK and the six founder countries. I did not vote for what the EU was becoming, which appeared to be a federal state run by Brussels bureaucrats who I believe do not serve the interests of any of the EU member states. For this reason, I voted Leave on Thursday. Although I have felt some anxiety, I also feel hopeful. I have no doubt we will see some turbulent economic times initially, but we have seen economic turbulence through the recession, and prior to that, with the high interest rates and inflation of the 1970s and 80s. As an \"out\" voter, I am still European. I still believe in mutually beneficial trade deals, both with Europe, and the rest of the world, and I support controlled immigration. Britain was, is, and will continue to be a great country. I am optimistic. We should see \"brexit\" as an opportunity. I voted to leave the EU because I feel that the British public are regarded as insignificant. We need to be able to make our own decisions that affect us including our laws and our spending, not least how much money goes to the EU. The amount of money we send to the EU is atrocious. The government called for a vote to stay in or leave the EU and the people of Britain voted out. The outcome of the vote should be respected. Otherwise the voters of this country will only have a voice when the result is what the politicians want to hear. It should be remembered that this is a democracy and everyone should respect the wishes of the majority. I voted out, even taking into account the impact this may have on my job. It was time we took control of our own destiny and the interests of the British public. Too long we have been the puppet of Europe, having to pay an extortionate amount of money for the privilege. All the money we spend on being a member of the EU could have been spent on other much more important matters such as doctors' wages, instead of supporting the countries that can't control their own economies such as Greece, Spain and Portugal. There are many reasons why this period will be difficult, especially for my employers and customers. We have already seen impacts on exchange rates. We don't know how it will effect our general trading terms. The remain campaigners who are calling for a re-vote should be ashamed. The turnout was the highest for many years, even more than the last general election. The British public came out in their millions to voice the opinion which has resulted in leaving the EU. If we were to do a re-vote that would completely undermine any future public votes in this country. So even after hearing all that may happen, I would not change the way I voted. I voted out and am pleased to have done so. It was the result I wanted and we can now start taking control of our own finances. All my friends also voted out. It makes no sense to be in. As a lawyer, I see nonsense legislation from Europe that we have no say in. I don't have an issue with immigration but it needs to be kept under control, to help our NHS and benefits system. We can't keep bailing out poorer countries. If there was a stricter test on them coming in then maybe I would have voted in. I'm more than happy with my choice. We knew the pound would crash but give it a couple of months and it won't affect our economy that much. It will grow, with more markets opening up which were previously restricted by the EU. The Germans will still sell us cars and the French will sell us wine. We can still travel there. People are just scared of change. It looks like we have taken the brave move and others may follow. I voted out and after reading the reactions of some in Europe and here at home, I am now convinced I voted the right way. This was meant to be a democratic election, yet those who lost are seeking a second referendum and now we're being bullied into a quick exit from those in European positions of power. That's hardly a democratic response.. Scotland now want a second independence referendum. Were they not conscious when they had the first one that a Brexit might be coming in the future?

{"article": "On the walls are the portraits of past Burmese leaders, beginning with her father General Aung San, assassinated on the eve of independence in 1947, and continuing into the era of thuggish military rule, face after forgotten face for whom nobody had ever voted in a democratic election. The new leader, elected with an overwhelming popular mandate, arrived surrounded by civil servants and guarded by police, fresh from meetings and with many more planned later in the day. Her interview with me was the first this year and a rare encounter with the media. Aung San Suu Kyi has been bruised by the criticism over her handling of the Rohingya Muslim crisis in Rakhine state. It is a long way from the days when reporters, myself included, made the journey to her home by the lake in Rangoon, also known as Yangon, to listen to her expound on the virtues of universal human rights. Back when I first met her in July 1995 she was a political prisoner a few days free, eager for news of the world and particularly South Africa, where I had just completed my assignment as the BBC correspondent covering the transition to democracy. She had followed my reports on the BBC World Service and was keen to know how the African National Congress managed to achieve the end of apartheid. There was an innocent eagerness about her back then, a hunger for knowledge on everything ranging from microfinance to the latest news in poetry and literary fiction. Then, as her popularity grew and the army became nervous, there was another long period of house arrest. The army continued with its repression. Thousands were rounded up during the peaceful, and abortive, protests by monks in 2007. She was only finally released three years later and allowed to resume a full-time political career. The woman I meet this week in Nay Pyi Taw in 2017 is undoubtedly changed. The heroine of the human rights community is now alienated from many of her old international supporters. She is wary of the media and disdainful of her international critics, far more the steely politician than the global icon feted from capital to capital when she was released seven years ago. Our exchange on Rakhine was polite but robust. I told her that having covered many conflicts I thought that what I'd seen in Rakhine state amounted to ethnic cleansing. Did she worry that instead of being remembered as an icon of human rights it would be as the Nobel laureate who refused to confront ethnic cleansing in her own country? No. She refuses to accept this definition, speaking instead of two communities divided and explaining her lack of public activism as not wishing to fan the flames of hatred through condemnation. It is also clear that the sharp turn in western voices, from adulation to condemnation, irks her. The more UN officials demand she does something, the less likely, it strikes me, that she will accede. There is a profound paradox here. I and other journalists in Asia remember the days when it was the military regime that denounced our reporting of human rights abuses and accused us of exaggeration. Now these complaints are levelled by a democratically elected government led by a former political prisoner. It is true that not all of the allegations that emerge from Rakhine state are true, and that the latest violence was sparked by militant attacks on the police. But the weight of evidence suggests an appalling toll on the lives of innocent people going back well before the recent appearance of a radical Rohingya groups. One of the most powerful memories I have of ethnic intolerance - and this is after reporting on Rwanda and atrocities in the Balkans - is seeing the plight of Rohingya penned into a ghetto in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine, and listening to the toxic rhetoric of Buddhist monks near a burned out Muslim village. The crisis in Rakhine will cause Aung San Suu Kyi no problems among the majority of Burmese, who remain loyal supporters of her National League for Democracy. She has the support of the street even if her backing in ethnic minority areas is declining. However the alienation felt by international supporters could become a problem if the military refuses to accede to her demand to change a constitution that gives them power over key ministries like defence and home affairs, and which prevents Aung San Suu Kyi from becoming president. She is too shrewd a politician to be unaware of this risk.

{"article": "Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, was murdered on an estate in Bristol in July 2013 amid false claims he was a paedophile. He repeatedly called police for help in the days before, the trial heard, but had been seen as a \"nuisance\". PC Kevin Duffy and Andrew Passmore were convicted of misconduct but PCs Leanne Winter and Helen Harris were cleared. The four Avon and Somerset officers were accused of letting their dislike of Mr Ebrahimi influence their decision making. Iranian-born Mr Ebrahimi, who was registered disabled, was beaten to death by neighbour Lee James outside his flat in Capgrave Crescent, Brislington, in July 2013. His body was set alight. Days earlier he had called police to report James had assaulted him. James believed Mr Ebrahimi had filmed his children but he was actually recording anti-social behaviour to submit to Bristol City Council. The trial heard PC Winter and PC Harris did not see any injuries on Mr Ebrahimi. Instead they arrested him for an alleged breach of the peace. A crowd gathered outside his flat cheered and James shouted: \"Paedo! I'm going to kill you.\" The court heard \"vigilantism was in the air\". After being released the following morning, Mr Ebrahimi repeatedly tried to get police to investigate his complaint against James and called the non-emergency 101 number 12 times. He was told his local beat manager - Duffy - would visit. \"My life is in danger. Right now a few of my neighbours are outside and shouting and calling me a paedophile. I need to see PC Duffy,\" Mr Ebrahimi told one operator. But the trial heard Duffy, 52,  saw him as a \"liar and a nuisance\" and never went to see him. He asked Passmore to conduct a \"bit of a foot patrol\" around Capgrave Crescent. Passmore, 56, was convicted of misconduct in a public office by falsely claiming during a police interview to have spent an hour patrolling the area around Mr Ebrahimi's home. Mr Ebrahimi's family claimed their brother was the victim of racism for years. Speaking outside court, his sister Mojgan Khayatian said there had been a clear failure by police. She said: \"Bijan was crying for help not one time, not twice, not three times. He made several phone calls and ignoring these phone calls for somebody who's very vulnerable, who's got a history of being vulnerable and seeking help from police for years, it was even worse.\" James was convicted of murder in 2013 and is serving a life sentence. Another Capgrave Crescent resident, Stephen Norley, was sentenced to four years for assisting an offender. Eighteen Avon and Somerset Police officers and staff - including Duffy, Passmore, Harris and Winter - still face internal police misconduct proceedings. Nine of them face gross misconduct charges. Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe described Mr Ebrahimi's murder as \"senseless\" She added: \"This tragedy should never have happened. A great deal has been done to understand and reflect on the events in the weeks leading up to Mr Ebrahimi's death.\" Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens said it was \"clear that on this occasion the constabulary failed local people and let down a vulnerable man in his own home\".

Scottish Water said the discoloured water appeared to have built up in the hospital's internal storage tanks. It said further sampling was being carried out but it was believed the discoloured water was caused by naturally-occurring manganese. A spokesman said this was harmless in the quantities commonly found in drinking water.

The aircraft were allegedly smuggling drugs from Central America and refused to follow the military pilots' orders. Another 11 unauthorised planes have been disabled on the ground this year. Venezuelan security forces say more than 35 tonnes of drugs have been found this year. The head of Venezuela's Strategic Operational Centre, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, told the country's state television that a plane had been targeted after \"all other means of persuasion had been exhausted\" in the early hours of Saturday. \"This was the first plane shot mid-air in the country since the approval of the Law and Control Regulation for the Integral Defence of the National Airspace, following the orders of our commander-in-chief, President Nicolas Maduro,\" Gen Padrino said. Another plane allegedly tried to evade the authorities by trying to land on an illegal airstrip in the jungle and was also shot down. \"These are drug trafficking mafias which intend to use our country as a platform for drug distribution, trespassing our airspace,\" the head of the National Anti-Drugs Agency, Alejandro Keleris Bucarito said, after posting a photo of the destroyed plane on Twitter.

{"article": "The funding council has published an analysis of changing patterns of young people going to university. It shows a widening regional gap, with Londoners taking an increasingly disproportionate number of places. The gender gap has widened too, with women more likely to go to university. The study from the funding council examines trends in young people entering higher education in England, between 1998-99 and 2011-12. The overall underlying trend is that more young people are going to university, with the proportion of 18-year-olds getting places rising from 30% to 38%. But this is not an even spread. The increase has been much greater among young women, with a current gender gap of 12%, compared with 3% in the late 1990s. This gender gap was even more extreme in the poorest areas, with women 35% more likely to go to university. The gap in university entry between rich and poor remains as wide in this decade as it was in the 1990s, although both groups have increased their numbers. \"Young people in the most disadvantaged areas would need to treble their participation rate in order to match the rate of those from the most advantaged areas,\" says the study, observing that the difference remained \"broadly stable\". But there had been significant regional shifts. London had the highest levels of participation in 1988-99 and this was even more pronounced by 2011-12. The proportion going to university has risen from 35% to 48%. Schools in the capital have become among the highest performing in the country and a much higher proportion of youngsters go on to university than anywhere else. What makes this particularly striking is that in 1998-99, youngsters in London in poorer \"low participation\" areas were the least likely in the country to go to university. But by 2011-12 they had gone from the bottom to the top of the regional league table. There are 23% of youngsters in London living in poorer areas now entering university. The lowest level of entry among the most deprived is now in the south-east, previously amongst the highest. The study says that more than half of all the extra disadvantaged entrants brought into higher education across England were from London. The highest level of participation by constituency, Wimbledon, has four times the level of university entry for the lowest, Nottingham North. This more local breakdown showed the highest levels of university entry in south-west and north-west London, with the highest rates of increase clustered around north-east and south-east London. The report highlights the places with the lowest levels of university entry, coastal towns, former industrial towns in the midlands and north, rural areas of the south-west, the east midlands and east of England. Along with Nottingham North, the other lowest individual constituency was Bristol South. In terms of the increase in the young people going to university, the biggest increases in the country were in Barking, Lewisham Deptford, Croydon North, Bermondsey and Greenwich. In contrast, North West Norfolk, Bognor Regis and Copeland in Cumbria saw numbers going into reverse. The lowest regional level of increase over these years was the south-west. Prof Les Ebdon, head of the Office for Fair Access, welcomed the \"sustained progress\" in increasing participation in higher education. But he said that narrowing the gap between the most and least advantaged would mean early intervention. \"This means encouraging children from an early age to think about higher education as an option, supporting teenagers as they make key decisions, and working with employers to reach out to potential mature students.\" He also warned that the fall in part-time student numbers would have a disproportionate impact on poorer families. Rachel Wenstone, vice-president of the National Union of Students, said: \"It's fantastic to see that young people still recognise the value of higher education, but it remains a national embarrassment that where you're from remains such a key factor in whether or not you go on to university.\" Prof Michael Gunn, chair of Million+, representing new universities, said: \"The increase in the number of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education is one of the great British success stories of the last 15 years. \"This is the result of governments being willing to fund an expansion in university places and widening participation initiatives and modern universities rising to the challenge.

{"article": "Across the 18 satellites now in orbit, nine clocks have stopped operating. Three are traditional rubidium devices; six are the more precise hydrogen maser instruments that were designed to give Galileo superior performance to the American GPS network. Galileo was declared up and running in December. However, it is still short of the number of satellites considered to represent a fully functioning constellation, and a decision must now be made about whether to suspend the launch of further spacecraft while the issue is investigated. Prof Jan Woerner, the director general of the European Space Agency (Esa), told a meeting with reporters: \"Everybody is raising this question: should we postpone the next launch until we find the root cause, or should we launch? \"You can give both answers at the same time. You can say we wait until we find the solution but that means if more clocks fail we will reduce the capability of Galileo. But if we launch we will at least maintain if not increase the [capability], but we may then take the risk that a systematic problem is not considered. We are right now in this discussion about what to do.\" Each Galileo satellite carries two rubidium and two hydrogen maser clocks. The multiple installation enables a satellite to keep working after an initial failure. All 18 spacecraft currently in space continue to operate, but one of them is now down to just two clocks. Most of the maser failures (5) have occurred on the satellites that were originally sent into orbit to validate the system, whereas all three rubidium stoppages are on the spacecraft that were subsequently launched to fill out the network. Esa staff at its technical centre, ESTEC, in the Netherlands are trying to isolate the cause the of failures - with the assistance of the clock (Spectratime of Switzerland) and satellite manufacturers (Airbus and Thales Alenia Space; OHB and SSTL). It is understood engineers have managed to restart another hydrogen clock that had stopped. Esa is also in contact with the Indian space agency which is using the same clocks in its sat-nav system. So far, the Indians have not experienced the same failures. A statement issued by the agency late on Wednesday gave additional details. It appears the rubidium failures \"all seem to have a consistent signature, linked to probable short circuits, and possibly a particular test procedure performed on the ground\". The maser clock failures are said to be better understood, with two likely causes, the second of which has caused most grief. The Esa statement said this second scenario was \"related to the fact that when some healthy [hydrogen maser] clocks are turned off for long periods, they do not restart due to a change in clock characteristics\". Actions are being taken to try to prevent further problems. These involve changing the way clocks are operated in orbit. Clocks about to fly are also likely to be refurbished, and future devices yet to be made will have design changes, the agency says. Esa is hopeful it can still launch the next four satellites in the constellation before the end of the year. Precise timing is at the core of all satellite-navigation systems. Atomic clocks generate the time code that is continuously transmitted to users on the ground to help them fix a position. The passive hydrogen maser clocks in Galileo are determined to be accurate to one billionth of a second per day, or one second in three million years. This performance ought to contribute to giving users fixes that have errors of a metre or less - significantly better than the standard open service from GPS. A fully operational Galileo system is regarded as a constellation of 24, split across three orbital planes in the sky. But spares are required also, and with one very early satellite in the constellation already considered very close to complete failure - for different reasons - there needs to be near-continuous production of spacecraft. The four latest satellites went up as a quartet in November; more are set to follow later this year. Galileo is a project of the European Commission, the EU's executive branch. The EC employs Esa as its technical and procurement agent. The development path to a \"European GPS\" has been a tortuous one. The project is years late, and the completion cost - expected to be some 7bn euros by 2020 - is substantially higher than that originally foreseen by EU member states.

{"article": "The data marks the biggest increase in overseas shipments in more than a year. Meanwhile imports declined in March by 1.7% compared to last year, leaving China with a trade surplus of 194.6bn yuan ($30bn; £21bn). The revival in exports has raised hopes that the world's second largest economy is not as badly affected as many had thought by the global slowdown. The trade data comes one day after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) again downgraded its global outlook. The IMF expressed concern over the lacklustre nature of the global economy, even as it noted there has been some recovery from the financial crisis and the recession which came with it. Later this week China will release its much-anticipated growth data for the first quarter. The forecast is for an expansion of 6.8% for the three months to March. Almost everything is up, so on the face of it good news for China.  But when you look at the figures for this time last year, there really was only one way to go. If you marry the export trade numbers - way past forecasts - with the increase in demand for some raw goods like crude oil and iron ore you see an economy that appears to be on the rebound. But beware two factors; the government itself has warned that the base line from March 2015 is low. A reminder that observers shouldn't get complacent about the downward pressures still threatening China's economy. And then there's the figures themselves, can they be trusted? The government said it hit its target of \"around 7%\" GDP growth last year but many experts think it's half that in reality. And as for the strategic shift - to move China away from being an investment-led export economy to something more driven by domestic consumption - these figures suggest it's still only the government that can see off a dangerous economic slowdown, not the Chinese consumer.", "question": "China 's exports in yuan @placeholder surged 18.7 % in March compared to the same period last year , new data shows .", "option_0": "terms", "option_1": "slowed", "option_2": "helped", "option_3": "jumped", "option_4": "surged", "label": 0}
{"article": "EU-Serbia negotiations would begin in January 2014 at the latest, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said at a Brussels EU summit. Talks on an EU association agreement with Kosovo will also get under way. Tensions between Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority and remaining ethnic Serbs resurfaced this week. Stabilisation and association agreements with the EU cover trade, economic and political relations. They are seen as important landmarks for applicant countries seeking EU membership. The summit conclusions say that before January \"the negotiating framework will be... confirmed by the European Council\" - a sign of the EU leaders' commitment to membership talks with Serbia. The European Commission President, Jose Manuel Barroso, called the Serbia decision \"indeed historic\". \"We very often use the word 'historic' in an abusive manner, but this is historic. Let's not forget what happened not so long ago in that part of Europe, with one of the most violent wars we saw - and now we will start negotiations with Serbia,\" he told a news conference after the summit. The EU leaders also welcomed the entry of Croatia into the 27-nation bloc, which will happen on Monday. A big celebration is to take place in the Croatian capital Zagreb on Sunday night. Croatia fought a bitter war against Serb forces during the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. It will become the EU's 28th member, and the second from former Yugoslavia, after Slovenia. Mr Van Rompuy said EU officials would visit both Serbia and Kosovo on Monday, in a sign of the EU's commitment to their integration with the bloc. Many countries recognise Kosovo as independent, but Serbia is among those, including Russia and China, that do not. Five of the 27 EU countries do not recognise Kosovo: Spain, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Cyprus. Under the April deal the ethnic Albanian government in Kosovo accepted a high degree of autonomy for Serb-majority areas in the territory's north. Belgrade insisted that the deal did not mean Serbian recognition of Kosovo's independence. In the capital Pristina, ethnic Albanian nationalists clashed with police outside parliament on Thursday as MPs ratified the deal with Serbia, brokered by the EU in April. Hundreds of protesters carried banners that read \"The deal will not pass\" and \"A state cannot be built with thieves\". According to Serbian media, Serbs who gathered to commemorate a historic battle outside the city on Friday were attacked with stones after they left the site by bus, and several people injured.

{"article": "The Western Health and Social Care Trust said it was working with residents and families affected by the sudden closure of Ashbrooke Care Home in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. It is understood 43 residents are waiting to be re-homed. Regulators said it was the first time they had forced a home to close. Conditions at Ashbrooke were described as the worst ever seen by regulators following an unannounced inspection last Wednesday. Failings included dirty facilities, a strong odour of faeces and urine and no evidence of action taken to address substantial weight loss in some residents. Runwood Homes, the company that operates Ashbrooke, said it was not given any notification of the closure and that regulators had found no concerns at their other Northern Ireland homes. \"We as an organisation are deeply saddened by the decision to close Ashbrooke Care Home and will do all in our power to ensure the transition of our residents to their new homes is as seamless as possible,\" said the company. At a meeting on Monday, relatives were told by the Western Health and Social Care Trust that residents could be moved to premises in Londonderry. The trust said it would \"work with residents and their families to manage the transition and find suitable accommodation that meets the resident's individual needs\". \"The trust anticipates that all clients will be placed in suitable accommodation within the next 10 days.\" Relatives I've been talking to have told me they've had sleepless nights worrying about where their family members are going to end up. There seems to be a lot of anger and a lot of disappointment - some have said they're happy with the care provided and have questioned the closure of the home. Others have wondered if there's a mechanism by which it could be kept open to avoid upheaval. There are two main factors in re-homing - these are mostly people from the Fermanagh area, but they could be re-homed anywhere in the Western Health and Social Care Trust area, which includes Londonderry and Tyrone. Another factor is that because most of the residents have a greater or lesser degree of dementia, they each need to be placed in homes that can provide them with the care they need. Just how many of those kinds of places are available? Sinn FÃ©in MLA Michelle Gildernew said she would lead a party delegation to meet the Western Trust over the relocation of residents to \"discuss what went wrong and how lessons learnt can ensure this never happens again\". \"The emerging picture of neglect of vulnerable patients is both heartbreaking and infuriating. She added: \"The priority now is getting these people the care they deserve without adding to the stress of the situation.\" Ulster Unionist MLA Rosemary Barton said it appeared the Western Health and Social Care Trust had given \"varying support\" to relatives in its efforts to relocate relatives and that there was a \"great deal of concern and worry\". \"Some have received excellent support from social workers while other families have set about the task of finding new accommodation themselves, with only very limited support from the Western Health and Social Care Trust. \"However the residents of Ashbrooke must be relocated to safe new homes that are convenient and easily accessible for their relatives. \"The Western Trust must also take some responsibility for relocating the staff and making sure none are left without employment.\"", "question": "Residents in a nursing home that was closed because conditions posed a \" serious risk to @placeholder \" will be re-homed in the next 10 days .", "option_0": "life", "option_1": "develop", "option_2": "improve", "option_3": "stop", "option_4": "protect", "label": 0}

Ten players have joined since Mata's switch for a then club-record £37.1m under Ferguson's successor David Moyes. \"They told me 'you are very important, you are one of the first',\" Mata said. Current manager Louis van Gaal completed the double signing of Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger and France international Morgan Schneiderlin on 13 July. Schneiderlin scored five minutes into his first United appearance with the only goal against Club America on the tour of the United States. \"I knew the club was going to have these kind of signings,\" Mata said. The total amount spent on the 10 players is £228.1m, a figure which does not include the £6m loan fee for striker Radamel Falcao, who has since joined Chelsea. Mata, who has scored 16 goals in 50 competitive games for United, added: \"We know there is still a lot of work to do. \"It's not just about bringing good players in. It's about playing well and winning trophies.\" During a 12-minute interview with BBC Sport, Mata answered the following questions: Do the signings of Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger make you fearful of your place? When you play for a top team you always know you have to be at your best level. There is a lot of competition for spots in the first team but I believe in myself. I always train the best I can. Between us all we have to help the team but obviously if you play for a team like Manchester United you are always going to have competition. Where do you still need to add to the squad? I don't know - this is a question for executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Van Gaal. I am quite happy with the players we have at the moment. Obviously I think they are looking in the market to bring a few more in. Let's see what happens. Where has further improvement got to come from this season? Last season we started a new philosophy with a new manager. It takes time. This season we know how the manager wants us to play. We know the way he loves to play football. It should be better for us. What is the manager like? With the media he can be brutal but also very funny. Like it is with you. We don't know what to expect. It depends how we perform and how we have been training. He is very straight. He is very direct. He is very honest. It is good. You can be a good or bad manager but, apart from anything, I believe in the person. Sometimes he is tough, as you can see. But I think he does it for the right meaning. What is his philosophy? To win with good football. Good football means to play with the ball and make the pitch big. To create, not to wait, and to be proactive. He wants you to be the boss in the game and the team that makes the tempo. Obviously you have to adapt sometimes and you have to defend a little bit more compact and know how to play without the ball. Were you envious at not being in the Champions League last season? Yes. Every Tuesday and Wednesday at home watching the games, mainly with Ander Herrera and David De Gea. We need to be back there. This club needs to be fighting for the Champions League.

{"article": "The LSE chairman, Donald Brydon, thanked shareholders for their \"strong support\" after 98.9% backed the deal. The two stock exchanges agreed a $27bn (Â£20bn) merger earlier this year, but the Brexit vote has raised questions about how it should be implemented. The LSE said the deal would still deliver value to shareholders. \"Whether the UK is just European or a member of the EU, the merger will create a globally competitive, industry defining market infrastructure group at the service of European industry,\" the company said. Earlier, Mr Brydon said he was confident of \"satisfactory\" regulatory approval for the tie-up. Last week, Germany's regulator said the proposed headquarters for the newly-merged company might not be in London. \"Without doubt... it is hard to imagine that the most important exchange venue in the eurozone would be steered from a headquarters outside the EU,\" said Felix Hufeld, Bafin's president. \"There certainly has to be an adjustment here.\" Bafin does not have a veto on the deal but it is thought that Deutsche Boerse is likely to take its concerns seriously. Mr Brydon told an extraordinary meeting of shareholders in London on Monday that Britain would remain in the EU for at least another two years providing ample time to work out the \"optimal structure\" for the deal. He denied the London Stock Exchange had received approaches from any company other than Deutsche Boerse. In a joint statement released shortly after the UK's referendum the companies said the outcome did not affect \"the compelling rationale of the merger\". In fact, the head of the Deutsche Boerse Joachim Faber said the decision made it \"ever more important to maintain and foster ties between the UK and Europe\". David Cumming, head of UK equities at Standard Life Investments, told the BBC: \"I think there will potentially be political interference from German regulators and politicians but it is not entirely clear they will scupper the deal. \"They don't like the fact the headquarters are here in Britain, but unless there is a significant change the deal will go ahead.\" The merger still needs to be approved by regulators and, according to the Reuters news agency, any major changes to it could need further shareholder approval.

{"article": "Pierre Cornlouer from Tredegar spent 30 years in the Navy, serving in the Falklands, the Gulf and Bosnia. He wrote The Adventures of Mrs Orangeleaf to explain to his daughter what life was like for servicemen. An animation of it is narrated by Simon Weston and voiced by 40 other veterans. They are all aged 20 to 85, with many of them people Mr Cornlouer has met in his role as chaplain for the Alabare charity - which helps those struggling to cope with life outside the military. The Armed Forces Covenant funded the animation and radio play adaptations and they will be premiered in Portsmouth to coincide with the 35th anniversary of the Falklands conflict later this year. Mr Cornlouer said recording them helped many veterans \"feel part of something\" for the first time since leaving the forces. \"My daughter asked 'what are you doing daddy?' when I spoke to her [while away]. I replied 'giving Benjamin [HMS] Illustrious his breakfast',\" he said. \"I described oil sandwiches, Norman the Harrier taking off from it and lights on the Hormuz strait between Iraq and Iran being pirates.\" Trying to explain to a child what he was experiencing was the inspiration behind him putting pen to paper. He was an assistant steward on the QE2 after it was commandeered to take soldiers to the Falklands when the conflict over the South Atlantic British colony broke out with Argentina in 1982. \"We got to know many of them and gave them a can of beer [as they got off] and wished them luck,\" he said. \"But then we had to pick up survivors from the Coventry and Antelope [British boats that had been bombed] and realised the Galahad [another ship] had also been hit. \"We lost some of them. That is when we realised the nature of the war.\" While flashbacks of what he saw, such as the badly injured servicemen he helped, can be triggered any time such as through television shows, his books give a different perspective of the conflict. Instead of the horrors, details on the Falklands War are limited to a story about \"two penguins, a seal and a ship stuck on ice\". Mrs Orangeleaf and the Pirates has sold 10,000 copies, while he has written two others, including Mrs Orangeleaf Goes to Santa's rescue - based loosely on the Army helping out after floods hit England over Christmas 2013. \"The idea is to let children and adults know that the Army, Navy and air force don't go around killing people,\" he said. \"You see on the news stories about places like Syria and some things are very graphic. \"There are messages in the book, like don't bully people, with a liar on the ship getting the worst jobs and details of the humanitarian work.\" Through his chaplaincy work, he runs coffee mornings for veterans around south Wales. He said being able to joke and make light of things they had experienced was part of the \"healing process\" for many ex-servicemen, with the project being an extension of that. Mr Cornlouer added: \"A lot of people come out of the forces and find life difficult. Their children can just see daddy has been in a war and is not very happy. \"But a soldier is a human being and they are just valleys guys. This [Mrs Orangeleaf] can hopefully mean they can explain things better and are film stars instead.\" Veterans taking part include Alice Robinson, who was in the Women's Royal Army Corps, who is the voice of Mrs Orangeleaf. Falklands veteran Simon Weston, whom Mr Cornlouer met on the QE2, agreed to narrate the animation. \"It is nice for all veterans to get together. One thing they miss is the camaraderie,\" he said. \"This works tremendously well - when they stop acting, they have a laugh.\" His words were echoed by Barry Edwards, a former corporal in the Royal Regiment of Wales, who met Mr Cornlouer at Alabare's Pontypridd's accommodation for veterans who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. He believes involvement in Mrs Orangeleaf has been \"inspiring\" for many who served in the Falklands, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. \"This has shown that the teamwork and comradeship still exists now as it did then,\" Mr Edwards said. \"It has allowed teamwork to flourish and banter to prevail, it has allowed the veterans to have a sense of belonging.\"", "question": "A book explaining to children how the armed forces \" do n't just kill people \" is now being used to help veterans suffering from issues such as post traumatic stress @placeholder ( PTSD ) .", "option_0": "disorder", "option_1": "hand", "option_2": "explains", "option_3": "life", "option_4": "events", "label": 0}
{"article": "In April 2015, the 31-year-old from Mugnano, on the outskirts of Naples, sent a series of sex videos to five people via WhatsApp. The recipients included her boyfriend Sergio Di Palo, with whom she had an unstable relationship. The videos showed her performing sex acts with a number of unidentified men. \"She was beautiful but fragile,\" remembers Teresa Petrosino, a friend for 15 years. \"She was with the wrong people at the wrong time.\" The videos were soon shared and uploaded to several adult websites. The physical actions on the tapes did not stand out. But a single sentence from Tiziana Cantone did. \"You're making a video?\" she asked the man holding the camera. \"Bravo!\" The words suggested an uninhibited young woman, who enjoyed being filmed during sex. By accident, the phrase gave viewers licence to watch the video without reservations: if she was so happy to be filmed, she wouldn't mind them watching. But Italians did more than watch. Users soon turned her comment into a meme-worthy punchline. Her image appeared on t-shirts and parody websites. No-one seemed to worry what the subject herself might think as she seemed so pleased about it. But this was a profound misunderstanding. \"People confuse being an uninhibited person with wanting to go viral,\" says social commentator Selvaggia Lucarelli. \"You can film a video, share it with some people but there's a tacit agreement that you won't share it further.\" Tiziana Cantone, a fragile woman, was horrified. \"She and I never actually spoke about the details of the video,\" says her friend Teresa. \"I never saw them, and I never want to see them. You could tell she was suffering a lot. But she was strong.\" Read more here: How Italians reacted to Tiziana's death Ms Cantone decided to fight back. But there was no immediate way to get the videos taken down. She took the case to court, arguing the tapes were uploaded to public sites without her consent. By this time, she was no longer able to live a normal life. \"She didn't want to go out as people would recognise her. She realised that the virtual world and the real world were the same thing,\" Teresa explains. \"She understood at some point that the situation would never be resolved; that a potential husband, her potential children could find those videos; that they would never disappear.\" Tiziana Cantone retreated to her family home in a quiet street in Mugnano, a working-class suburb of Naples. It took her mother, Maria Teresa Giglio, weeks to find the strength to tell reporters about her daughter's life. \"My daughter was a good girl but she was also vulnerable,\" she told the BBC. \"She lacked a paternal figure, from birth. She never met her father. This affected her entire life.\" Mother and daughter lived together. In happier times, Tiziana listened to Italian singers, read novels and played the piano. But after the intimate videos were shared online, she withdrew. \"Her life was ruined, in front of everyone,\" says her mother. \"People made fun of her, parodies ended up on pornographic websites. She was called shameful names.\" In September, a court in Naples ordered the intimate videos to be removed from several websites and search engines. But the court also ordered her to pay â‚¬20,000 (Â£17,200, $21,600) in legal costs. It was all too much. On 13 September 2016, Maria Teresa Giglio went to work at the local town hall. Her daughter stayed at home. Ms Giglio received a phone call at work. \"My sister-in-law called me, and in a calm voice told me to come home; when I got here I saw the police, the ambulance, and I quickly understood,\" she says, breaking down. \"My sister-in-law tried to pick her up and save her. My neighbours didn't allow me to get out of my car. I almost fainted. They didn't want to let me into this house. I wasn't even able to see her for a last time. \"The day she died, my life ended.\" One day later, Maria Teresa Giglio buried her daughter in a white coffin. The notice outside the funeral described her as a \"sweet, beautiful, fragile angel\". There is a sad paradox at the heart of Tiziana Cantone's death. By taking her own life, she drew even more attention to the videos she hoped everyone might forget. Her mother has forced herself to watch the tapes. \"You can only imagine what it is like. I wanted to see details that would allow me to understand the truth. That was not my Tiziana,\" she says, convinced that her daughter was under the effect of drugs. She believes that the distribution of the videos didn't happen by chance. \"It's as if this was a premeditated, criminal plan. They just wanted to show the face of this poor girl, with the intention of exposing her on the internet.\" Read more here: In particular, Ms Giglio wants her daughter's former boyfriend, Mr Di Palo, to explain exactly what role he had in the sharing of the videos. \"He didn't help me to save her life. But maybe he can help me get to the truth. I'm desperate.\" In November 2016, prosecutors questioned Mr Di Palo for 10 hours. They wanted to know whether anyone was guilty of inciting Tiziana's suicide. Mr Di Palo declined our request for an interview. \"We refrain from making comments, out of respect for poor Tiziana who suffered so much due to the enormous publicity that her case received,\" says Bruno Larosa, Mr Di Palo's lawyer. \"We trust the courts and it should be noted that my client is not accused of anything.\" In the aftermath of Tiziana Cantone's suicide, the tone of Italy's debate about pornography and privacy has changed. \"I think this case did make a difference, quite drastically, to the way that Italian journalists talk about these cases of revenge porn,\" says social commentator Selvaggia Lucarelli. \"They used to have a very carefree approach, and her death changed it. In subsequent cases, one of them involving a celebrity, they were a lot more cautious.\" But there is also a lesson for anyone who chooses to share intimate videos online. \"People think that their virtual life and their real life are parallel realities,\" warns Ms Lucarelli. \"They're not. They coincide. The web is our life. So anything that you don't do in real life you shouldn't do online.\" Tiziana's videos can no longer be found on the main search engines but they still exist. Her mother wants Italy and the rest of the EU to agree a much faster way to get private material removed from the internet and make the big internet firms act responsibly. \"I speak on behalf of other mothers who may be suffering like me,\" she says. Italy's privacy tsar, Antonello Soro, agrees things have to change but does not specify what the government might do. \"We need a quicker response mechanism from different online platforms, but it is also necessary to increase respect online,\" he said in a statement. \"We need strong investment in digital education to promote a culture and sensibility that are adequate to the new online world.\" For Tiziana's mother, life is now a fight to defend her daughter's name, and to prevent others from suffering the same fate. \"I hope that the name Tiziana Cantone, instead of standing for mockery, becomes a name that could save the lives of other women. I would like this to happen.

{"article": "These Western fighters have had a high media profile, especially since the beheading of two US journalists by a suspected British jihadist. Yet recent studies show that most foreign militants in Syria and Iraq are Arabs. The New York-based Soufan Group and the London-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalization suggest that the total number of foreign fighters in Syria at present is between 11,000 and 12,000, with only about 3,000 of them from the West. Of the remainder, Tunisians make up the largest group (estimated at about 3,000), followed by those from Saudi Arabia (about 2,500) and Morocco (1,500). Arab media stress that the true figures could be much higher than these estimates. Tunisian media sources, quoting a PEW/CNN report, point to the fact that their country has become the main \"incubator\" of \"terrorists\" fighting in Syria. Since the overthrow of Tunisian President Ben Ali in 2011, the country has seen a low-level insurgency involving Islamist militants. Several opposition politicians have been assassinated, and dozens of militants and soldiers have been killed. Tunisia has also suffered from the chaos in neighbouring Libya and the presence of militants there. According to a report attributed to the Syrian military, almost 54,000 foreign combatants from 87 different countries have come to the country since the start of the civil war. Thousands of them are said to have been killed. The report, first published by Tunisian daily newspaper al-Chourouk and widely circulated in the Arabic media, says the study was compiled by an unnamed Syrian military research centre. It says Chechens top the list of foreign fighters with 14,000 combatants, of which 3,691 have been killed. Besides Chechens, the largest groups of fighters are thought to be Saudis, Lebanese, Libyans, Iraqis and Tunisians. Saudi fighters are estimated at 12,000, with 3,872 reported killed and 2,689 said to have disappeared, including seven women. Out of 9,000 Lebanese involved with jihadis in Syria, about 2,904 have lost their lives, including four women. According to Maghreb analysts quoted by al-Chourouk, Libyans and Tunisians are mainly fighting under the IS banner, while Algerians and Moroccans are with al-Nusra Front. It is not known how many Chechens or Saudis are fighting alongside IS. Like their Western counterparts, Arab jihadis appear to rely on both online and offline radicalisation and recruitment techniques. In the immediate aftermath of the Arab Spring in 2011, the newly-found freedoms in countries such as Tunisia, Egypt and Libya allowed Islamists and jihadis alike to openly promote their ideologies. This was done through handing out pamphlets, public talks and conferences as well, as via recorded videos and content shared online, radicalisation in mosques and schools, and mainstream media. The Syrian conflict provided a narrative to help galvanise the recruitment process. And when the Muslim Brotherhood was removed from power in Egypt, the space available for radical clerics tightened, leaving social media and personal networks to fill the gap.

{"article": "Food Standards Scotland (FSS) has found that 400 billion calories worth of food was purchased by Scots households in 2014/15, the equivalent of just over 2,000 calories per person, per day. The report also discovered that there was 115g of sugar in the food the average Scot purchased daily last year - well above the World Health Organisation's recommended intake of 25g a day. However, its statistics should be treated with some caution. The report relates to how many calories are purchased, rather than consumed and takeaways, restaurant meals and working lunches are also excluded. Soft drinks, biscuits, confectionary, table sugar, cakes and pastries contained more than 45% of the sugar purchased by Scots last year. Although fruit topped the list of \"total sugar purchases\" in Scotland in 2014/15, many less health foods made it into Food Standards Scotland's top 10 list. The amount of regular soft drinks bought by households in Scotland dropped by 21% in 2014/15 - but sales of diet drinks remained static. A total of 173 million litres of drinks with added sugar were sold to Scots homes last year. About one billion individual servings of cakes and pastries are purchased by Scottish households annually. However the FSS has found that the amount of sugar and fats found in the products has risen steadily since 2011. The numbers of puddings and desserts bought into homes in Scotland has dropped by 7% since 2010. Despite that, the amount of fat the Scottish population receives from puddings and desserts has remained static and sugar levels have increased. FSS researchers believe their evidence suggests that products have changed their recipes to include more sugar or fat products. The volume of pies and pastries purchased in Scotland dropped by almost 17% since 2010; sausage sales fell by 8%. It has led to a drop in the amount of saturated fat and salt people in Scotland have derived from the products. Scottish households are buying slightly fewer crisps and savoury snacks than they did in 2010. The FSS believe a \"reformulation\" of the products may have led to a marked reduction in saturated fats and a small reduction in salt. People in Scotland bought 10% more oil-rich fish last year than they did in 2010. The volume of plain bread purchased in Scotland has declined by 12% in the past five years, according to the FSS research And the number of potatoes bought by the nation's households has fallen by 28% since 2010.", "question": "The latest report by Scotland 's new food @placeholder offers an intriguing glimpse into the eating habits of the nation .", "option_0": "records", "option_1": "helped", "option_2": "body", "option_3": "shows", "option_4": "data", "label": 2}
{"article": "The former South Wales Police officers are suing the force after corruption allegations were made over the Lynette White murder investigation. In 2011, they were cleared of perverting the course of justice following the wrongful conviction of three men for her 1988 murder. The review's findings are due in 2016. On 14 February 1988, 20-year-old Lynette White was found stabbed more than 50 times in the Cardiff docklands flat where she worked as a prostitute. South Wales Police launched an investigation and Stephen Miller, Yusef Abdullahi and Anthony Paris, who became known as the \"Cardiff Three\", were jailed for life in 1990 after being convicted of her murder. But their convictions were quashed on appeal in 1992 after judges were told they had been \"fitted up\" for the crime. A new investigation was launched by the force but it was not until 2003, 11 years after the Cardiff Three were freed, that the real killer was identified. A breakthrough in DNA techniques led detectives to Jeffrey Gafoor's Bridgend home. He was arrested and later admitted her murder. In the years that followed, questions were raised over the initial investigation into her death ultimately leading to eight former police officers being charged in 2011 with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. But the trial later that year collapsed in dramatic fashion when prosecutors lost confidence in the disclosure process and the case was abandoned. All eight were cleared of any wrong-doing and have since launched civil action against South Wales Police. And on Thursday at a pre-case hearing at the High Court sitting at Cardiff, it was said that the findings of the review into the matter would be made public after the the civil action is concluded. Richard Horwell QC, who was appointed by the Home Secretary to head the inquiry, had initially been due to report his findings by the summer but due to the civil action under way is now not expecting to complete his inquiry until the spring of 2016.

{"article": "Greenpeace called it \"another attempt to silence criticism\". In April, the government blocked the group's bank accounts, accusing it of violating tax laws and working against India's economic interests. In May, the Delhi high court ordered two accounts to be unfrozen and allowed them to collect domestic donations. The foreign funding licence was cancelled on Thursday, a home ministry official told the BBC. The government order is the latest in a series of actions aimed at Greenpeace and a number of other organisations whom the authorities have accused of working against the country's interests. \"It is yet another attempt to silence campaigns for a more sustainable future and transparency in public processes,\" Greenpeace India said in a statement released late on Thursday. It said cutting access to its foreign funding was \"a desperate attempt to get us to cease our work\", but added that since a majority of the group's funding came from Indian citizens, most of their projects would continue. Greenpeace, which has been present in India for 14 years and employs 340 people, says it has been targeted because of its campaigns on issues such as pollution and harmful pesticides. In April, while freezing its bank accounts for six months, the government accused Greenpeace of not fully declaring the amount of foreign funds it brings into the country. India has also accused the environmental group of \"stalling development projects\" by protesting against large infrastructure plans. Since coming to power in May last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has cracked down on several non-governmental organisations.

We believe in transparency, truth and professionalism - we're ready to answer all questions.\" We had been invited to watch the graduation of a new cohort of spin-doctors for the self-proclaimed government in Tripoli. Not the most scintillating of occasions but one designed to send a message of business as usual. Listen to From Our Own Correspondent for insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Broadcast on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:02 GMT and Saturdays at 11:30 and  BBC World Service Listen to the programme Download the programme If the ruling coalition in the west of the country is to be believed, all is well in the new Libyan state. Over a lunch of chicken and rice one of the graduates introduced herself. Sabah Abul-Ez had been living in exile with her family in Manchester in England but she moved back to help rebuild the country after the overthrow of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. For more than two years the country prospered but the hopes and dreams of those who joined the revolution have gone awry. Ms Abul-Ez has still to learn the alchemy of spin doctoring. She told me she is thinking of returning to Manchester with her child because of the state of the country. Her husband wants to stay. \"If he doesn't want to go back, I'll divorce him,\" she said. I think she was joking. The last time I was in Libya was towards the end of the war which resulted in Gaddafi's downfall. The picture seemed clear then. What used to be called The Arab Spring was in full bloom and an uprising in the name of freedom and democracy was about to overthrow a brutal four-decade-long dictatorship. Three-and-a-half years on and dreams of a brave new world in the Middle East are in tatters. Today even getting into Libya is a challenge. The roads from the borders are unsafe for Westerners who used to be welcomed with open arms, passenger ferries have stopped running, foreign airlines have cancelled flights to Libya, most embassies have shut and foreign workers fled. So we joined a small band of pensive passengers on a charter flight into the last airport to remain open in the west - now in the hands of an Islamist militia. What we saw was quite unexpected. Libya's rival power bases: Why Libya is lawless On a warm Friday evening on the Tripoli seafront we watched parents photographing their kids playing at a candy coloured funfair. Groups of young men in a nearby park performed tricks on motorbikes in front of a crowd of excited onlookers. Restaurants were busy, the streets jammed with traffic and shop shelves full. We drove for hours out of Tripoli to the east and the west. The only remarkable things were how bad the roads were and how poor the people for such an oil-rich nation. There were no Kalashnikov-wielding, balaclava-clad bandits or wild-eyed jihadists waiting to nab us on the road. No smoke, few guns and frankly, it felt safe to travel unaccompanied. We even stopped for a while at the magnificent Roman ruins of Leptis Magna for some sightseeing, where families wandered between marble columns looking for a nice spot for a picnic. But as events in the capital this week show, this seeming normality is perilously thin and frequently punctuated by bouts of violence. I met a young engineering student at a packed cafe near the main mosque. Mohammed did not want to give his full name and he did not want to be filmed. But he told me that by nine at night people head to their homes, afraid of the militias and criminals that control their streets. He told stories of death and displacement. Prices have gone up and some salaries are not being paid. I asked him about the growing influence of some hard-line Islamist elements. \"Everyone has guns now,\" he said. \"It's like a magnet for extremism, because whenever they have guns they have the power to control you in the same way Gadaffi did.\" Many are deeply offended by the idea that they are seen as religious hardliners. When we drove to Libya's economic and business heartland in Misrata, a young man from the local council greeted us. He introduced himself and immediately asked if I thought he was al-Qaeda. The chaos that has descended on the country has allowed some extremists to prosper - mainstream Islamists too. But crucially, what really divides people are tribal and regional differences. Too many here feel they are the rightful heirs of the revolution and they are willing to fight to the death to claim its spoils. Libyans try to go about their daily lives, desperate for some normality, but few expect it anytime soon.

{"article": "With almost all the votes counted, Ms Bachelet had 62% against 38% for Evelyn Matthei, a former minister from the governing centre-right coalition. Ms Bachelet first served from 2006 to 2010, but under Chile's constitution she could not stand for a second consecutive term. She narrowly missed out on outright victory in the first round last month. By Gideon LongBBC News, Santiago Winning Chile's presidential election was pretty easy for Michelle Bachelet. She led the contest from the start and never faced much of a challenge from her bickering centre-right opponents. The hard part will start in March when she takes office. Even Ms Bachelet's closest aides acknowledge her education reforms will be costly, eating up an extra 1.5% to 2% of gross domestic product each year. She says that money will come from taxes, particularly on big business. The other big pledge of Ms Bachelet's campaign is constitutional change. She says Chile needs a new constitution to replace the one drawn up under Gen Augusto Pinochet in 1980, as well as a new electoral system. But perhaps the biggest challenge facing her is the weight of expectation. After four years of centre-right rule marked by huge street protests, Chileans are clamouring for change. Read Gideon Long's analysis in full BBC Mundo's Ignacio de los Reyes said that hundreds of people applauded Ms Bachelet when she took to the stage outside the headquarters of her coalition in the centre of Santiago, some even cried with joy. Many of them were women, members of the gay and lesbian community and environmentalists - some of the core groups that supported Ms Bachelet throughout her campaign. In her victory speech, Ms Bachelet, 62, said she would carry out \"deep reforms needed in Chile\", but she assured voters she would do so \"responsibly\". \"Today in Chile we're in the majority and it's time we moved forward to fulfil the dream we all have, to again believe in ourselves, and to believe that there's strength in unity,\" she said. \"I am proud to be your president-elect today. I am proud of the country we've built but I am even more proud of the country we will build.\" Ms Bachelet is now set to become the first leader in Chile to serve two terms since the military rule of Gen Augusto Pinochet from 1973 to 1990. Upon hearing the news, her supporters took to the streets to celebrate, waving flags and sounding car horns in the capital, Santiago. Her rival, Evelyn Matthei, 60, conceded defeat and congratulated Ms Bachelet in person. Coming close to tears, Ms Matthei told her supporters that her \"deepest and honest desire is that things go well for her [Michelle Bachelet]\". \"No one who loves Chile can want anything else,\" Ms Matthei said. Ms Bachelet thanked Ms Matthei for her good wishes and said that both shared a love for their homeland and a willingness to serve its people. A paediatrician by training, Ms Bachelet won 47% of the vote in the first round on 17 November. Ms Matthei secured 25%. Ms Bachelet leads an alliance of her Socialist Party, Christian Democrats and Communists and has campaigned on policies designed to reduce the gap between rich and poor. Chile is one of the richest countries in Latin America, but millions have staged protests over the past few years to push for a wider distribution of wealth and better education. Ms Bachelet wants to increase taxes to offer free university education and reform political and economic structures dating from the dictatorship of Gen Pinochet. Her manifesto this time is much more radical than before, the BBC's Gideon Long in Santiago reports. Ms Bachelet was constitutionally barred from serving a second successive term but was very popular when she left office. Ms Matthei entered the race after two candidates of the centre-right alliance resigned earlier this year - one for alleged financial irregularities, the other one after struggling with depression. She called for a continuation of the policies of outgoing President Sebastian Pinera, asserting that Chileans are \"better off\" now than when he came to power four years ago. As children in the 1950s, the current rivals were neighbours and used to play together on the airbase where their fathers, both air force generals, worked. Ms Matthei's father, Fernando, rose through the ranks to run a military school. Michelle Bachelet's father, Alberto, had a job in the Socialist administration overthrown by Gen Pinochet in the 1973 coup. He died in 1974 of a heart attack while in custody. An investigation concluded that the 51-year-old general had probably died of heart problems aggravated by torture at the military academy.

{"article": "You can expect to receive a lot of communications from political parties in the coming weeks, as they prepare for June's snap election. It's the same for everyone on your street, a place full of different characters - some with children, some younger, some older. There is likely to be just as much political difference among your neighbours, from the loyal party supporters to those changing their vote at each election. In other words, whether your constituency is described as a \"middle class suburban seat\", a \"traditional working class community\", or a \"Remain voting area\", there are still significant differences between individual voters. This matters a great deal to the parties and it's highly likely that friends and neighbours will receive very different campaign messages from the parties - even different ones from the same party. For several elections now, parties have been making use of many different sources of data to target information at voters. This use of big data has become very important to them for three key reasons. First, we voters have changed quite a bit. In fact, we've been changing quite a bit for the last 40 years. Traditional allegiances between voters and parties have declined rapidly and while there are still strong party loyalists, there are far fewer than there used to be. This means more voters are unsure as to how they'll cast their vote - a big opportunity for the parties, because winning the backing of these voters means they will not just be relying on their core support. As a consequence, parties have been targeting seats much more intently and with greater precision. The second reason is that while membership of many political parties has risen in recent years, they have generally had fewer volunteers that they can call on come election time. This means that technological developments such as using data to target voters have provided a useful alternative. Thirdly, parties have become more efficient. There is little point in seeking to convert voters who are committed to another party, or indeed strong supporters already on your side. Instead, parties are increasingly focused on the \"waverers'\" and \"undecideds\" - the people whose votes are going to win elections. To do this, the parties go to great lengths to combine a whole range of data sources. First, they use their own canvass returns - information about voting intentions - collected on the doorstep and the telephone over the course of a few years. The most recent information collected from voters is now uploaded in real time. This tells the parties if the would-be voter is a committed supporter, \"waverer\" or \"undecided\". They then combine this with market research data, which tells them more about the individual - demographic characteristics such as age, sex, education level, income and family size. This is the information which has led parties to create key target groups at past elections - so-called \"Essex Man\" or \"school gate mums\", for example. In turn, these are then combined with further information the parties have gathered on the doorstep, from telephone calls and social media engagement. Tailored leaflets, Facebook posts and other messages reflecting the voter's interests and concerns can soon follow. So, while a family with young children might receive a leaflet about what has been done for primary schools in the area, their retired neighbour may receive a different circular about what is being done to help pensioners. So does it make any difference? The short answer is yes. This use of big data to target key voters and decide where to focus resources invariably leads to stronger electoral performances. This was well illustrated at the last general election, where all three of the main parties improved their performance as a result of their targeting strategies. All three parties ran their most intensive campaigns in the seats that mattered most. Indeed, had Labour and the Liberal Democrats not targeted voters so well, their results would have been even worse. Yet for all that, big data alone will not win elections. Over the last six elections, the one approach that works better than all others when persuading voters is face-to-face contact. So, while the use of big data matters - and makes election messages more personal - it plays a supporting role to human contact, rather than replacing it. All of which makes this election a particularly interesting one. Campaign techniques which focus on big data usually begin long before polling day - maybe six or nine months before. But this snap election doesn't afford that luxury and there is a danger in bombarding voters with the same volume of communications in four weeks. So ironically, this election may prove to be more traditional - still informed by big data, but with a stronger focus on the human touch.

{"article": "So to many, the prospect of a free 30-hours-a-week will sound like a fantastic offer. But when the government, in other words the taxpayer, is footing the bill for a policy, there are other questions. Such as what does it expect to get back from spending the money, other than a lot of grateful parents? In this case, we are not starting with a blank sheet. All three and four-year-olds in England are already entitled to the equivalent of 15 free hours a week in term time. So we might expect in these times of tighter public spending that a detailed evaluation is under way by the Treasury. If so, it is being conducted in such secrecy that they couldn't share the information with the Lords Select Committee on Affordable Childcare. They weren't able to persuade a Treasury minister or official to give evidence to their recent inquiry. As the committee said in its final report in February: \"No hierarchy of policy objectives was provided in the written evidence from HM Treasury.\" In other words, it is not clear exactly what increasing free childcare is expected to deliver. In the past, ministers have suggested that making childcare more financially accessible would encourage a greater number of women into the labour market. Whatever you think of this as a broader societal benefit, it does have potential gains in terms of tax revenues and potentially reducing the lifelong income gap between men and women. But the effect seems to be very modest, according to the academics who have done the most comprehensive review of the impact of the free 15 hours for all three and four-year-olds. Dr Claire Crawford, research fellow at the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, described the impact as \"reasonably small\". \"We found that around two percentage points more women were in work compared with before the scheme. That's the equivalent of about 12,000 more women in work,\" she said. When they looked more closely, it seemed that was because many three and four-year-olds were already in some kind of childcare. So the cost of around Â£1.9bn a year largely delivered a cash benefit to working mothers. But what about the children? Learning and playing in a safe environment with other children can help develop social skills that are useful for beginning school. There is evidence that for children from poorer backgrounds, high-quality childcare can help narrow an attainment gap that will otherwise limit their life chances. Quality, of course, can be defined in many different ways. For the very smallest children, having kind, patient, caring staff who can give them attention is a good start. But among academics, there is a consensus that quality means qualified. Private and voluntary nursery and pre-school settings are considerably less likely to employ a graduate with early years training because of the cost. There were 1.9 million children, under the age of five, receiving some form of childcare or early education during term time in England in 2012. Of those, 1.6 million received formal provision. Use of childcare is particularly high among three to four-year-olds, of whom 88% (1.18 million) received formal childcare or early education in 2012, compared with 37% (429,570) of nought to two-year-olds. As at September 2013, there were more than 25,000 nurseries and pre-schools, providing education and care to more than one million children aged nought to five; 54,000 childminders cared for a further 270,000. Added to this, 290,000 three-year-olds and 45,000 two-year-olds received education and care in maintained schools. During the election campaign, Save the Children pointed out that two in five private or not-for-profit nurseries don't have a graduate on their staff. So expanding hours alone won't help close that gap for children early in life. Which brings us back to the 30 hours being offered to all three and four-year-olds where both parents are in work. There is an opportunity for the government to drive up standards by insisting that only those places rated good or outstanding can provide the extra hours. There is a challenge too, with many in the pre-school sector saying they are already cross-subsidising the free hours by charging more for younger children or the remaining hours. It is an argument the government has accepted to the extent of promising an increase in the average rate. By how much could be crucial to getting enough pre-school providers to take part in the extended scheme.", "question": "Any working parent will tell you the cost of childcare burns a massive @placeholder in the family wallet .", "option_0": "hole", "option_1": "drop", "option_2": "boom", "option_3": "decline", "option_4": "spot", "label": 0}
{"article": "The Higher Education Policy Institute says some universities need to treble how much they spend on support. The report says one in 10 students has a \"diagnosable mental illness\". Ruth Caleb, of the higher education working group on mental health, said counselling could help students before a \"concern becomes a crisis\". The report calls for more support for students who have problems such as depression, anxiety and loneliness, warning that the number of student suicides has risen. It calls for more continuity of care, such as allowing students to be simultaneously registered with a GP both at their parental home and at university. Universities are urged to carry out a review of their current services and find what can be improved. In many cases, funding for counselling and mental health services is inadequate, says the study. The report author, Poppy Brown, is herself a student at Oxford University, conducting research on anxiety disorders. \"The scale of the problem is bigger than ever before,\" she said. \"Yet support is hard to access, universities often underfund their counselling services, and the NHS does not recognise how vulnerable students are. \"In particular, there is often no consistent care between term-time and holidays. We need to tackle these problems,\" said Ms Brown. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that students starting university needed to know that support was available. \"Mental disorders are most common in young adults, just at the age when many people become students,\" he said. \"Going to university can be stressful, especially for first-in-family students. \"Typically, you lose your established support networks, move to a new part of the country and take on large debts. \"Occasionally, it even ends in tragedy.\" The report is supported by Norman Lamb, former Care Minister, who said: \"I regularly meet with university students all across the country and am struck by how often mental health is raised as one of their main concerns about life on campus.\" There have been warnings of sharply rising demand for counselling and advice from students. The University of York earlier this year released figures showing that half of the ambulance callouts to its campus were for incidents of self-harm or suicide attempts. Universities UK says a strategy for student wellbeing is currently being devised by a group chaired by Steve West, vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England. It will set guidelines for counselling and mental health services that should be available from universities and the NHS. Universities UK's chief executive, Nicola Dandridge, said: \"It must be a core part of the offer to students, parents and staff as well as to local and national stakeholders. \"Student wellbeing must be at the heart of the university.\" Figures from a leading US university published this month suggested that demand for counselling there was even higher. Among students starting university at Harvard this autumn, almost one in five had already received counselling.

{"article": "It said \"strong evidence\" implicated government forces in the killing of four men near rebel-held Donetsk. When the bodies were discovered Russian media spoke of \"mass graves\" there. Meanwhile a huge blast has rocked part of Donetsk, as clashes continue despite a truce agreed on 5 September. The shockwave from a powerful explosion damaged the Donbass Arena stadium on Monday. It was a venue for Euro 2012 football matches. Reports say it happened near a munitions factory on the outskirts, in the same area as the airport, where fierce fighting has raged in recent weeks. No casualties have been reported. A dramatic video on YouTube showed the shockwave disrupting a rebel press conference. The pro-Russian separatists allege it was caused by a \"Tochka-U\" missile. \"There is no doubt that summary killings and atrocities are being committed by both pro-Russian separatists and pro-Kyiv [Kiev] forces in eastern Ukraine, but it is difficult to get an accurate sense of the scale of these abuses,\" said Amnesty's Europe and Central Asia director John Dalhuisen. In a new report, Amnesty urged both sides to investigate such killings and other abuses thoroughly, because some had been \"deliberately misrecorded\". \"Some of the more shocking cases that have been reported, particularly by Russian media, have been hugely exaggerated,\" Mr Dalhuisen said. The pro-Russian rebellion began in Donetsk and Luhansk in April, inspired by Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in March. The separatists in the predominantly Russian-speaking east were enraged by the overthrow of elected pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Amnesty compiled its report based on research conducted widely in eastern Ukraine in August-September. An Amnesty delegation visited the village of Nyzhnya Krynka, near Donetsk, on 26 September where four bodies - believed to be local residents - were found. Amnesty says there is no doubt that Ukrainian government troops and volunteers were in control there when the victims went missing. There is also evidence of summary executions by pro-Russian separatists in the region, Amnesty says, including the killing of two captives in Severodonetsk in July. Two bodies found in April near the town of Raigorodok, in rebel-held territory, bore signs of torture, Amnesty says. \"Victims have included pro-Ukrainian activists and suspected sympathisers, local criminals and detained combatants,\" an Amnesty press release said. A rebel commander quoted by Russia's RIA Novosti news agency says the separatists are now attacking Ukrainian positions near Schastye, a town in Luhansk region.

{"article": "The parishes of St Minver and Rame Peninsula held a referendum on reserving new homes for full-time residents. It followed a vote in St Ives last year which approved the same restrictions. That move was challenged in the High Court by a developer but the referendum result was upheld. Four communities in England have now adopted the restriction on second homes, including Lynton in north Devon, which voted in favour before St Ives. The referendum was held in St Ives after the number of second homes topped 25% of the total housing stock. St Ives estate agent Paul Le Bas said the referendum result meant developers were looking elsewhere. But buyers were scooping up existing homes instead which still put pressure on prices, he said. Buyers were also looking further afield in the town, away from seafront fisherman's cottages to outlying residential areas and that was having a \"detrimental effect\" on prices for first time buyers, he added. Places which are not subject to the second home restriction, like Hayle, had seen more interest from developers. \"People are looking elsewhere and it was coming to that anyway because St Ives has outpriced itself,\" Mr Le Bas said. \"The referendum was a nudge in that direction.\" Christopher Balch, professor of planning at Plymouth University, said the results at St Minver and Rame may lead to more. \"But this is a policy that's going to take five or 10 years before one can really judge whether or not it's achieved the objectives,\" he said.

{"article": "It sits inconspicuously next to the other handbags on the shelves at high-end fashion brand Kate Spade. There is nothing notably different about it. Yet it was made in a factory that doesn't have a reliable source of running water, where the electricity routinely cuts out, and where, until relatively recently, the workers didn't have the necessary manufacturing skills. It's in a tiny village called Masoro in landlocked Rwanda. There are no dependable roads, which means all the products made here have to be airlifted out - a much more expensive option than the usual way of sending them by ship. And perhaps most unusually, this factory didn't exist at all until global fashion firm Kate Spade decided to open it and fund its creation just over three years ago. The obvious question is: Why? \"We like to stretch ourselves,\" laughs Mary Beech, chief marketing officer at the firm. She says as a brand that makes clothing and handbags for women, and whose employees are mainly female, doing something to help empower women \"came very naturally\". The branding of the product is subtle, says Ms Beech, because they don't want it to be a token charity product. \"We want women to buy these bags because they walk into the store and love them. First and foremost it has to be a beautiful product which is completely natural and integrated,\" she adds. Rwanda's horrifying 1994 genocide, when 800,000 Rwandans were killed, continues to affect people today, and Kate Spade says this history was an added incentive for choosing the location. Of course, many brands undertake charitable projects. Fashion firm Asos, for example, sells a \"Made In Kenya\" range produced by local clothing manufacturer Soko, which it says aims to support local craftsmanship. Similarly, footwear firms Toms and Roma Boots both give away a pair of shoes to a child in need for each pair they sell. The difference with Kate Spade's charitable initiative On Purpose, the firm says, is that it's a business venture that had to make commercial as well as emotional sense. \"It couldn't be a crafty aside done for corporate social responsibility that didn't tie back into economic sustainability,\" says Taryn Bird, senior manager of the On Purpose initiative. She said this was because the firm wanted to set up something that lasted and enabled the factory to be financially independent, eventually taking orders from other fashion brands and becoming part of the global supply chain. The only way to make sure this happened, was to set it up themselves, says Ms Bird. The factory is not owned by Kate Spade, but is an official supplier. The people who work there - around 150 - are employed by Abahizi Dushyigikirane Corporation, known as ADC. So is this just exploiting Rwanda's low-wage economy? Kate Spade says not, pointing out even the lowest paid worker's salary in the country is considerably higher than the median salary for private sector jobs in Rwanda. It has also set up a life skills programme at the company, offering counselling, information on health and nutrition and English language lessons. While the firm won't be drawn on how much exactly it ploughed into the factory to get it going, Ms Beech says it was \"a minimal investment\". Almost four years on she says they are \"on track\" to get their investment back and for the factory to become profitable. The staff retention rate is an impressive 98%. But Africa is not such an unusual choice for a firm looking to diversify its supplier base. Labour costs are already much lower than in China. According to Georgetown University in Washington, which studied the Kate Spade project, staff in factories in coastal China earned around $700 (Â£537) a month, over six times the average $113 monthly salary at the ADC factory. Africa also offers what Ms Bird describes as \"a very business friendly climate for export companies\". ADC does not have to pay duties on incoming raw materials and is also able to export the finished bags to the US without tariffs. In contrast, tariffs on handbags from Asian suppliers range from 4.5% to 17.5%, according to Georgetown University. So Africa has the potential to become the world's next low-cost manufacturing hub thanks to a cheap workforce and an abundance of raw materials. A lot of production has moved there already. Ms Beech, however, says that wasn't why Kate Spade chose Rwanda. The bags made there were additional orders reflecting increased demand for its products. Pietra Rivoli, a professor teaching finance and international business at Georgetown University, and part of the team which researched the project, says it proves it's possible to put a factory anywhere. \"The set up was not terribly complex. It's not something that other companies could not do given the motivation and support from management,\" she says. She says the supportive factory set-up made ADC feel very different to any other factory she had visited. \"I'm not saying other factories are somehow bad. But most supplier relationships tend to be very transactional. The relationship is one of monitoring for labour abuses, whereas the ADC approach is a much more positive philosophy.\" Typically, how cheaply and quickly something can be made are the main criteria a company uses for deciding where to locate a factory. Prof Rivoli says the Kate Spade example offers \"a demonstrative case study\" of an alternative approach. \"What they have shown is that it can really be a win-win. The factory can pay the company back [for the set-up costs] and the firm can support the worker and their communities. So far it's one small-scale experiment. But Kate Spade says it is already planning to pilot a second factory in a different developing country in the next couple of years. \"This time we'll make sure it has access to a port,\" laughs Ms Beech.

{"article": "Two years ago, American film maker Jeremy Saulnier took his revenge film Blue Ruin to Cannes to screen as part of the Directors' Fortnight - a strand of the film festival which has screened early works from Martin Scorsese and Ken Loach to more recent films by the likes of Clio Bernard. His new film Green Room casts British acting royalty Patrick Stewart as the leader of a gang of white supremacists in a Portland backwater bar. They lay siege to a dressing room where a young band are cowering, having witnessed the aftermath of a brutal murder. And it's all set to a thrashing punk soundtrack. \"I grew up in the punk rock hardcore scene in Washington DC and had always been attracted to the aesthetic of that world,\" he explains. \"It's also very kinetic and physical and I loved that world. My high school years were spent with my friends making movies and playing in punk rock bands so the idea's been gestating for quite some time.\" The film also features Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin, as the band's bass player, with Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat as the guitarist. British actor Joe Cole, seen recently in Peaky Blinders, and Callum Turner play the other band members. British actress Imogen Poots is also stuck in the room with them, sporting plenty of attitude and a rather marvellous Chelsea fringe haircut [a punk style long at the front and short or shaved at the back]. The decision to cast a renowned stage actor against type as a backwater racist is the one of which Saulnier is most proud. \"We were about two weeks out of shooting and we still didn't have Darcy [Stewart's character] and I thought the film would implode,\" he admits. \"But Patrick swooped in. He got the script, he saw Blue Ruin and he was up for an adventure.\" The British actor arrived on set pre-prepared, having worked on a detailed back story with the director. \"You hear horror stories of big name actors being a nightmare and not knowing their lines but he came in, he knew everything he had to do and discussed everything,\" he says. Saulnier also cast his best friend Macon Blair, who starred in Blue Ruin, as another member of the skinhead gang. \"He got his hair cut short and bought fake tattoos from the internet and auditioned for the role,\" says Saulnier. \"I thought, 'not only is he going to get this role, he's the only person who can do it'.\" Another key character is the music, which plays a major role in the film. \"We have Slayer, we have Bad Brains, we have CCR [Creedence Clearwater Revival]. All of these crazy awesome bands. \"But also in the background of some of the scenes, and in one of the live performances, are [songs] from my high school bands. \"Hearing these songs that I used to hear in 1994 in Virginia being played live by Anton and Alia was a dream come true. The film is incredibly violent with various characters dispatched with shotguns, machetes and even a vicious dog. But the director insists \"ideally there is an emotional impact to everything. The visceral blowback of seeing these acts on screen is not easy to digest - it's never supposed to rest easy.\" The press screening at Cannes over the weekend was punctuated with gasps and squeals, which delighted Saulnier. \"This is a straight up genre film, it's for my 19-year-old self and the kids I grew up with. It's a movie for fans, if you're a horror nerd. \"But I also wanted to make sure that the violence is not celebrated. It's grounded and brutal and it has to serve the intensity of the story. If it's just violence for violence's sake, you lose the value of it.\" For all the horror, Green Room is not without lighter moments of comedy, which often serve as a release valve for some of the more intense moments. A neat running gag involves the band all choosing a band which they would take with them on to a desert island. They all go for the most obscure, credible bands until they face genuine danger and the truth comes spilling out. Without ruining the joke too much, it seems the hardest punks have a weakness for pop music. And it has a great payoff in the film's closing scenes. \"I always find humour in dark places, it also seems natural. I really let it evolve and I find a little irony here or a moment for a character. I like the fact when the characters are not experts and [there is] lots of confusion and miscommunication, that is a good environment for dark comedy.\" So, what is Saulnier's one desert island band? \"Definitely (Black) Sabbath,\" he says.

Just under 10,000 people in England and Wales needed treatment for diabetes-related kidney failure that year. The charity said the figures were \"concerning\". Kidney failure is a common complication in people with diabetes. Around three million people in the UK are thought to have diabetes, with most cases being Type 2. Another 850,000 are thought to have undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes, There are a number of checks which people with diabetes should undergo each year - to ensure that potential complications including eye and foot problems are picked up early.

More people have this - but Diabetes UK warns the urine test is also an essential part of the check-up.

Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: \"It is really concerning that a quarter of people with diabetes are missing out on a simple check that could identify kidney problems early enough to slow their progression. \"Kidney failure might not worry people with diabetes as much as other complications such as blindness and amputation, but it can have an equally devastating impact on quality of life. \"All those people who are not getting this check are at increased risk of needing dialysis and ultimately of dying early.\" And she said the cost of treating kidney failure was part of the reason diabetes costs made up 10% of the NHS budget.", "question": "A quarter of people with diabetes do not get the kidney checks they need to detect early @placeholder of damage , a charity suggests .", "option_0": "millions", "option_1": "levels", "option_2": "signs", "option_3": "control", "option_4": "parts", "label": 2}

{"article": "Only Sinn FÃ©in had held the education post until now. But Peter Weir will be aware of many of the pressing issues he faces, as he recently chaired Stormont's education committee. With Simon Hamilton responsible for universities as part of his economy brief, the DUP now oversee every aspect of education - from pre-school through to higher education. In the run up to the assembly election, the party produced a policy document specifically on education which set out their priorities. While they firmly back academic selection, it is unlikely that they will attempt to reintroduce a Northern Ireland-wide test. Instead, it is likely that it will become easier for primary schools to teach to - and facilitate - the current Association of Quality Education and Post Primary Transfer Consortium-run tests. However, the new minister may press both bodies to find a common test rather than continue to run separate ones. The big problem facing Mr Weir will be money. The education budget has fallen, while costs are rising. Many school leaders warn that they are facing deficits which could lead, in the worst cases, to staff and subject cuts and higher class sizes. The DUP have said that they support more money going directly to schools, so principals may have more say on what their budget is spent on - if not more funding overall. In addition, the new minister may take a fresh look at the area planning process. That aims to ensure that the size of schools and where they are located meets the needs of pupils. A number of reports have said that we have too many schools in Northern Ireland. Closing or merging a number of those deemed unsustainable would undoubtedly help save money, but, in practice, any move to do that inevitably meets strong local opposition. The DUP also broadly backed the \"shared education\" approach favoured by previous minister John O'Dowd, where individual schools from different backgrounds collaborated while maintaining their own independence and ethos. So it is unlikely that the integrated sector, which educates about 7% of pupils, will grow significantly in the coming years. One change that the DUP has committed to is to change the GCSE-grading system to bring it in line with changes taking place in England. That means that pupils in Northern Ireland will soon get grades from 1-9 rather than A*-G when they get their GCSE results, and should mean schools can re-introduce exams set by English examining boards. Mr Weir's appointment has been broadly welcomed by representatives from a range of sectors, who believe that he is well aware of the challenges they face. However, those in the Irish medium sector may be a little nervous about a DUP minister committed to tackling what the party criticised as \"preferential treatment\" when it came to money for new school buildings.", "question": "For the first time since the @placeholder of the Assembly in 1998 Northern Ireland has a DUP education minister .", "option_0": "aftermath", "option_1": "establishment", "option_2": "future", "option_3": "result", "option_4": "head", "label": 1}

{"article": "In My Mother and Other Strangers, the peace of a small Tyrone parish is disturbed when an American airbase opens nearby. The five-part series is set in the forties and was written by well-known musician and screenwriter Barry Devlin. \"It's like a big spaceship floating into this rural place,\" he said. \"It's set in a parish called Moybeg, which might or might not be something to do with a real parish called Ardboe. \"In 1942 this enormous airbase was dropped right into the middle of it, which let all of these exotic creatures with ray-bans and proper uniforms out into the parish.\" The series stars Hattie Morahan as Rose Coyne and Owen McDonnell as her husband Michael. However, Hattie falls in love with the American Captain Ronald Dreyfuss, played by Aaron Staton, best known for his role as Ken Cosgrove in Mad Men. According to Staton, playing Dreyfuss meant learning more about his own grandfather, who fought in the battle of the Bulge in 1944. \"I've always been very proud of his service and it made me think about my grandfather although his experience was probably very different,\" he said. \"But it certainly made me wonder about what he saw. \"This actually happened, these bases in Northern Ireland. \"You've got these kids who've left home to possibly go off and die, and they're coming and disturbing what was a peaceful community. \"They feel at times entitled to a bit of fun as part of their service, but it's disrupting what would have been a quiet parish. \"It's my character's position to try to help these two worlds understand one another.\" The character Rose is English, although she has lived in Moybeg for nearly two decades since marrying Michael. According to Barry Devlin, that means she also has to confront different attitudes to the war and the Americans from some of the other villagers. \"There's a certain amount of resistance to the Americans coming in,\" he said. \"Some of that is just the kind of envy young men who don't have much money feel for young men who do. \"That's a kind of a volatile and potent mix.\" Devlin has previous written episodes of hit series like The Darling Buds of May and Ballykissangel.

The International Committee of the Red Cross had released a list of 90 missing British and Irish people, but the BBC understands more than 30 have since been accounted for.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device As Britain basked in a May heatwave 25-year-old striker Robert William Thomas Stokes - known fondly as Bobby - kept his cool for Saints. Southampton, led by former Coldstream Guardsman Lawrie McMenemy, were given \"no chance\" against the superstars of Tommy Docherty's Manchester United before the kick-off on 1 May. But, latching on to Jim McCalliog's through ball, Stokes despatched a shot past the diving Alex Stepney in United's goal, earning his side a 1-0 win and writing his name into Southampton folklore. As the 40th anniversary of their day in the Wembley sun approaches, Stokes' cousin and the author of a new book on his life, lift the lid on his story. As a child, Stokes lived 30 miles from Southampton on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth, and dreamed of playing for their fiercest rivals. \"Unfortunately for Bobby, his trial coincided with Portsmouth having financial problems and they scrapped their reserve and youth teams,\" said Mark Sanderson, author of 'Bobby Stokes: The Man from Portsmouth Who Scored Southampton's Most Famous Goal'. \"The management at the time famously said, 'there's only money for fish in the sea in Portsmouth'. Bobby ended up signing for Saints in 1968.\" But the residents on the estate did not turn their backs on their boy and on Sunday 2 May, 1976, Pompey's heartland was decked in red and white to welcome the Wembley hero back home. Cousin Maria Johnson remembers the day well, as hundreds of people lined the street for a glimpse of the cup final hero. \"I don't think it bothered the Paulsgrove people he was playing for Southampton at all. Most of them supported him anyway,\" she told BBC South Today. \"There was red and white bunting, all to welcome Bobby home. They weren't celebrating Southampton as such, but Bobby - the local boy done good.\" Six months before that May Day afternoon, Stokes might have left The Dell, Southampton's former home. Transfer-listed by the club in November 1975, he turned down the chance of a swap deal with Portsmouth's Paul Went, and reportedly said: \"I just don't think it's the right move.\" How right he proved to be. \"These were the days when teams were only allowed one substitute, there were finer margins,\" Sanderson said. Stokes was ever-present in Saints' run to the final, scoring against West Brom and Blackpool in the fourth and fifth rounds before his iconic goal against United. \"The cup final was one of the very few games shown on television,\" Sanderson added. \"So whether it's grandparents or kids, all around the country they now knew who he was.\" Life was about to change for Stokes and his family. \"Everything was mayhem, everyone was cheering,\" recalls Johnson. \"I wore his semi-final shirt. It was just wonderful for him, and for us really.\" David Coleman's Match of the Day commentary famously mentioned how the goal won Stokes not just the cup, but a Ford Granada car as well. However, he was never able to drive it despite being filmed at team-mate Mick Channon's testimonial the following Monday, sat on the bonnet with his L-Plates. He would catch the train to training from Southsea every day. Nobody knows what happened to the Granada. Despite his Wembley winner, Stokes would start only eight more games for Saints. McMenemy was looking to shuffle his pack and, most importantly, secure Southampton promotion back to the first division. Stokes found himself dropped after the first game of the season and after Ted MacDougall's arrival from Norwich, he was sold to Washington Diplomats in the North American Soccer League. \"In those days the American season was played in the summer,\" said Sanderson. \"So he played in the summer of 1977, had seven months at Portsmouth in the 1977-78 season and then came back to the UK in 1980.\" During his time in the USA, Stokes scored the winning goal in New York against the Cosmos in front of 50,000 people at the Giants Stadium. Within a year of that goal against the likes of Pele and Bobby Moore, he was making his debut for non-league Chichester City. After retiring, Stokes went into coaching and worked in a number of soccer schools alongside Wembley team-mate Peter Osgood. He ran a pub called the Manor House in Cosham, near Portsmouth, before working alongside cousin Maria at the Harbour View Cafe down at The Hard in Portsmouth. Bronchial pneumonia sadly caused his death at the age of just 44 in May 1995 in the same Paulsgrove house where he was born and to which he returned as a hero in May 1976. \"He was a lovely man, so kind, ever so thoughtful,\" she said. \"He wasn't well. His marriage broke up and I don't think he had come to terms with it. \"When I knew he wasn't well, I took him home. His mum and dad nursed him until the day he died. \"He was a pleasure to know and I'm proud of him and I know his mum and dad would be too.\" Stokes' cult status among Southampton fans lives on. His surviving Wembley team-mates will parade through the city centre on the same open-top bus from 40 years ago before the Premier League match against Manchester City at St Mary's on Sunday. \"I don't like to think of it (Stokes' premature death) as a downward spiral,\" Sanderson added. \"If you score that goal, it's probably going to be a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Bobby might have died at a young age, but he packed a lot of life into those 44 years.\"", "question": "They said it would be one of the most one - sided FA Cup finals ever , with pundits predicting scores of four , five and even six - @placeholder in Manchester United 's favour against Second Division Southampton at Wembley in 1976 .", "option_0": "form", "option_1": "landed", "option_2": "starred", "option_3": "nil", "option_4": "gathered", "label": 3}

An article entitled \"the dictatorship of democracy\" in El Mundo voices the fear that other countries could follow Britain's example. \"What is disturbing is that, after Brexit, fools can say with greater strength and certainty: 'Yes you can.'\" In Italy's La Repubblica, a commentary says the vote for Brexit reflects rising general discontent by the \"excluded\" that is driving the rise of the likes of Donald Trump in the US, as well as of Italy's own populist Five Star Movement. On the website of Polish news magazine Polityka, commentator Andrzej Celinski warns against \"giving in to the wave of nationalism\", and appeals to Poles to end what it calls their hesitant approach to the EU project. \"In the face of a real threat to the [European] Union, Poland's political leaders must stand together to fight for European unity,\" he urges. \"Do not follow the British. Build Europe\". An article in Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza agrees, saying that the anger felt by many EU citizens must be channelled into a desire for a \"stronger Europe and better democracy, not nationalist phantoms\".

{"article": "Twenty-sixteen will very likely mark the first time the concentration of CO2, as measured atop Hawaii's famous Mauna Loa volcano, has been above 400 parts per million for the entire year. The forecast is from the UK Met Office. It says carbon dioxide levels have seen a surge in recent months as a result of the El Niño climate phenomenon, which has warmed and dried the tropics. These conditions not only limit the ability of forests to draw down CO2 from the atmosphere but also trigger huge fires around the globe that inject extra carbon into the air. This means the instruments at Mauna Loa, which maintain the benchmark record of CO2, are unlikely to see any month in 2016 where the concentration dips below 400ppm (that is, 400 molecules of CO2 for every one million molecules in the atmosphere). To be clear: the value has no particular significance for the physics of the climate system; it is just a number. But it has resonance because the last time CO2 was regularly above 400ppm was three to five million years ago - before modern humans existed. \"There's nothing magical about this number,\" said Prof Richard Betts at the Met Office's Hadley Centre in Exeter. \"We don't expect anything suddenly to happen. It's just an interesting milestone that reminds us of our ongoing influence on the climate system,\" he told BBC News. The usual trend seen at the volcano is for the CO2 levels to rise in winter months and then to fall back as the Northern Hemisphere growing season kicks in. Last year most months were above 400 with only three below. Ordinarily, one expects the carbon dioxide concentration to rise by an average of about 2ppm per year, but the team expects a record rise in 2016 of 3.15ppm, plus or minus 0.53ppm. The scientists used a seasonal climate model to predict sea-surface temperatures in the Eastern Pacific - where the El Niño shows itself most obviously - and then linked these to a statistical relationship with CO2 to generate a picture of what levels would probably look like across the calendar year. This gives an average for 2016 of 404.45, with a September low of 401.48 (again with errors of plus or minus 0.53ppm). The team has already had success in forecasting the 2016 high, recorded in May, of 407.7ppm. The group had predicted 407.57. \"It's important to note that this year's rise in CO2 is bigger than the last El Niño, in 1997/8, because human emissions have gone up by 25% since then. So, it's the natural effect on top of the increasing human effect,\" said Prof Betts. For the future, it is unlikely that CO2 concentrations will come down again at Mauna Loa within at least a generation, even if the commitments to constrain emissions agreed at the Paris climate summit last year are fully implemented. The Earth system responds only very slowly to change. \"Elsewhere on the Earth's surface, we will see values below 400. At Barrow in Alaska, for example, you get a much larger seasonal cycle,\" the meteorological agency's head of climate impacts research explained. The CO2 time series at Mauna Loa is recorded by two independent groups. One is associated with the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa); the other is curated by California's Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The latter's graph of ever-rising carbon dioxide levels has become known as the \"Keeling Curve\", after the man who first started taking the measurements in 1958 - Charles Keeling. Back then the ppm value was around 315. Today, Keeling's son, Ralph, continues his father's work, and is a co-author on the Met Office paper. \"Back in September last year, we suspected that we were measuring CO2 concentrations below 400 ppm for the last time,\" he said in a statement.  \"Now it is looking like this was indeed the case.\" The research is published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Meanwhile, former New Zealand hooker Corey Flynn has left the club, despite having a year to run on his contract.

{"article": "As the recent sackings of Kevin Pietersen and Michael Laudrup reminded us, modern sport is characterised by evasiveness, insincerity and suspicion on all sides. And try getting anything vaguely interesting out of a Premier League footballer nowadays. Assuming they can spare two minutes of their time. Fury, meanwhile, says things like this: \"I'm a very complicated man - one minute I might be thinking about the stars, the next I might be thinking about punching somebody in the face.\" I think Fury is joking. Sometimes it is hard to tell. For example, he sounds genuinely amazed when he describes all the cooking and washing he has to do in training camp, as if he has stumbled upon unequivocal proof of womankind's true calling. My wife gets treated right and she thinks I'm a nice person. I'm not a woman, but to be married to a handsome man like me - a stallion - must be a good feeling \"These women, they really do deserve a lot of respect,\" he says. \"I had to sack myself from doing the washing, I couldn't keep on top of it.\" On Saturday, Manchester heavyweight Fury fights for the first time in 10 months, against unheralded American Joey Abell at the Copper Box Arena in London. Victory for Fury, who is unbeaten in 21 professional fights, would set up a rematch with Dereck Chisora and put him on the verge of a world title shot. With Vitali Klitschko having swapped boxing for politics and younger brother Wladimir getting on in years, Fury believes this is his moment. And not before time. Since Fury's last encounter, a seventh-round knockout of Steve Cunningham in New York last April, life has been muddled and maddening, not to mention hard on the pocket. The 25-year-old was supposed to have fought fellow Briton David Haye last September, only for the former world champion to pull out a week before the bout with a cut eye. The bout was rescheduled for February, only for Haye to announce his retirement last November, citing a shoulder injury. In the wake of Haye's announcement, Fury took to the internet to declare himself done with boxing. But so it is with Fury, who has a relationship with his Twitter account such as others have with their psychotherapist. Sometimes foul-mouthed, sometimes sick, sometimes Biblical, Fury's Twitter timeline reads like the outpourings of an extremely turbulent priest. Which is why some might find it worrying that Fury rejects the suggestion his Twitter voice is merely a persona. \"You'll just get me in different moods,\" says Fury, who was fined £3,000 by the British Boxing Board of Control last March for an online attack on Liverpool heavyweight David Price. \"You might see a flashy, arrogant person, you might see someone who can't be bothered living any more. \"Doing controversial things in life is what you'll be remembered for, not for how kind or how nice you were. People think of Mike Tyson and they don't think 'youngest heavyweight world champion ever', they think of him raping someone, biting someone's ear off, being the baddest man on the planet. \"People want to listen to what I say, whether it's rubbish or facts. And not everyone is as gifted as me in being able to talk rubbish. Anybody can be Mr Boring and sit in the corner and be nice and quiet. But that ain't me. If I'm going somewhere, I'm going to be the life and soul of the place. \"I'm an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up any more. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me - an idiot, maybe?\" Fury's detractors - and they are legion - call him far worse. Usually hiding behind online pseudonyms, tough guys that they are. But it is often difficult to defend him, especially when he resorts to homophobia and casual death threats. But it is not unreasonable to point out that he receives some sickening abuse relating to his gypsy roots, of which he is immensely proud. \"We come from fighting backgrounds,\" says Peter Fury, Tyson's uncle and trainer. \"So he's got to fight fire with fire. When you insult a young fighter, what do you expect? \"He's a nice, placid lad who never loses his temper. Anybody who's nice to Tyson, he's nice to them back. You've got a young man here trying to do his best. These people on Twitter giving him all this abuse, where are they in life?\" Tyson comes from a long line of fighting Furys, most of whom scrapped without gloves in fields and fairground booths. His father, 'Gypsy' John, made the transition from bareknuckle boxer to the licensed ranks, losing an eliminator for the British heavyweight title to Henry Akinwande in 1991. \"Boxing is a key element of the travelling culture,\" says the younger Fury, whose father was handed a long jail sentence in 2011 after causing a man to lose an eye in a brawl. \"Before anything else, you learn how to fight. \"Whereas in other cultures little kids will kick a ball about, we're punching hands. When we have a dispute we're not supposed to go to the police, we're supposed take our shirts off, go outside and sort it out with fisticuffs. To be a good fighting man is one of the best things you can ever be in life. \"But you go outside now and people are pulling swords out. You've got little men wanting to be big men but they can't, so they pull out a gun and let five bullets go instead.\" It isn't only the passing of more manly traditions that Fury laments. The portrayal of the traveller community in the mainstream media, with its obsessive and exploitative focus on 'big fat' celebrations, also gets his blood up. \"You wouldn't have 'big fat Pakistani weddings' or 'big fat black weddings',\" says Fury, who currently resides in a house in Morecambe, Lancashire. \"It's discrimination and it's very offensive. There are idiots out there like the people on those programmes but you can find the good and bad in all walks of life. If you go to Wythenshawe, where I was brought up, it's not like that.\" Fury, a born again Christian, can descend deep, as when discussing his religion. \"I'd like to think that God is going to forgive me for everything,\" he says. \"But you wake up in the morning and there is sin everywhere. It's a hard road to walk but God gives me the strength every day to batter the devil.\" But a few minutes later Fury is singing sweetly on request - he fancies himself as a crooner - while rocking back and forth in his chair and smiling sheepishly. More proof that this 6ft 9in beast of a man is every bit as complicated as he says he is. \"I fight to provide a better life for myself and my family,\" says Fury, who has two children with his wife Paris, a daughter Venezuela and son Prince John James. \"I'm not interested in being a role model for anybody else. Every man has his own life to live and every man should take his own path. \"You can never tell what I'm thinking. My wife never knows what we're doing next. She gives me stick because she knows if I go out on a Friday night I'm coming home at seven in the morning. \"I'm probably a hard person to live with but it's like it or lump it. She gets treated right and she thinks I'm a nice person. I'm not a woman, but to be married to a handsome man like me - a stallion - must be a good feeling.\" You can never tell what Fury is thinking but at least he tells you if you ask.

{"article": "Tom Ryan is just your typical, easy-going American entrepreneur - he wants to take over the world. Mr Ryan is founder of restaurant chain Smashburger, one of the fastest-growing companies in the US. From just one outlet in Denver in 2007, it now has more than 150 branches nationwide, and will later this year open its first foreign sites in Kuwait, Canada and Costa Rica. Europe and Asia are then due to follow. Aiming to reach 500 US branches within the next few years, Smashburger's current global ambition is for ultimately 2,000 international outlets. Mr Ryan, a restaurant industry veteran, says: \"Everyone said the burger industry in the US was too crowded for a new entry, but I was sure there was a place for a new chain offering much higher quality than the established players.\" Backed by a private equity firm, Smashburger was immediately popular with American consumers, and its expansion quickly started. Mr Ryan adds: \"Obviously I'm delighted with how things have gone. I knew we had a strong concept, and therefore a fighting chance.\" Smashburger is far from unique in the US. Starting a business: Ask a question The likes of Google, Twitter and Facebook may not make hamburgers, but all three were also just start-up businesses not too many years ago. Facebook was only established in 2004, and Twitter was not set up until 2006. Facebook was first started in a university dormitory, and Google's early days were based in a garage. But as the US continues to produce a wealth of start-up companies that quickly grow to dominate their marketplaces, what are the reasons behind America's continuing entrepreneurial success - and can they be copied? And are successful entrepreneurs born or bred? Californian Eric Ries may be just 33, but he's a Silicon Valley veteran. With a number of technology sector start-ups behind him, \"some successful ones, and some failures\", he is now an in-demand start-up adviser, and author of The Lean Start-Up. Mr Ries says that when it comes to supporting entrepreneurship, the US has some key advantages over Europe and other parts of the world. \"There are definitely cultural factors in the US's favour, perhaps most importantly a willingness to tolerate failure,\" he says. \"In Europe if you fail in business you are going to find it very difficult to borrow money the next time around, but in the US it is almost seen as a useful experience to have gone through.\" Mr Ries adds that this all makes American entrepreneurs more willing to take risks. \"On top of this, some European countries have very high personal liability levels for entrepreneurs, which is a terrible mistake,\" he says. \"Regulations are also lower in the US for smaller firms. Add all these together, and you can see the advantage the US has. \"But it is not all one-sized, there are still some great firms in Europe.\" Julie Meyer is a US entrepreneur who lives and works in London, where she is chief executive of investment fund Ariadne Capital. This invests ??55m per year in early stage technology businesses. Ms Meyer agrees that more Americans are willing to take a chance on starting up their own company, which she says is a \"cultural thing\". \"But I don't want to stress the US market too much. I believe we have excellent entrepreneurs in the UK, it is just the available financing and tax policies that lag behind. \"The UK government needs to cut taxes for small firms to help spur growth and act as an incentive. \"Overall this would mean more successful small firms and therefore more tax revenues.\" Looking across Europe in general, Ms Meyer says generations of left-leaning governments have held back entrepreneurship. \"The welfare states across Europe have not helped boost entrepreneurship, because governments have told people 'don't worry, we'll look after you' instead of 'you have a  unique contribution to make',\" she says. \"Instead governments need to be much smaller, with more focus on individuals. And we are now heading in that direction, because European governments suddenly realise they cannot afford to be so large.\" But if European nations want to copy more of American-style entrepreneurship, how easily can this be achieved? Or is it simply that more entrepreneurs are born in the US? Mr Ries says: \"I'm definitely not one of those people who say that entrepreneurs are born with the 'right stuff'. \"It is teachable, but countries have to change their cultures and rules to help support successful start-ups. That's the US's cultural advantage.\" Julie Meyer also says she doesn't believe entrepreneurs are born. \"You aren't born, rather I think entrepreneurs are nurtured,\" she says. \"My father was an entrepreneur, so I realised it was not the easiest choice to make. But I knew it was what I wanted to do, and I had that experience to draw upon.\" Smashburger's Tom Ryan says that while entrepreneurs may have \"a little bit of creativity that is not inherent in others\", the first two key factors to success in business are your product and your business model. He adds: \"The third is work with great people, you need these to make everything come together.

{"article": "By Tuesday, 12 hours after the blaze, damaged tents had already been cleared away and most of the residents of this sprawling facility had returned after escaping the flames and sleeping out in the bush. The metaphor of the inferno was clear. For months, anger has been building in Moria as asylum applications were delayed and migrants were held in an overcrowded camp. Moria has capacity for 3,500 - but about 5,000 live here in stretched facilities. \"Fighting broke out between blacks and Afghans,\" says Kingsley, a Ghanaian man whom we spoke to through the fence, the authorities not allowing us in. \"They were throwing stones at each other and there was an argument over food. The fire caused a lot of damage and my luggage was destroyed.\" Does he have hopes of staying in Europe, I ask? \"We've been given papers that say we'll probably have to return to Turkey,\" he replied. \"But I have hope in God.\" The EU deal struck to deport failed asylum seekers to Turkey and then back to their country of origin significantly cut the numbers of new arrivals here. But the quid pro quo was supposed to be visa-free travel for Turks travelling to the EU's Schengen zone in return. It hasn't happened, as Brussels says Turkey needs to amend its broad anti-terror legislation. Ankara has refused and the deal is foundering, sparking fears that new arrivals here will again soar. In the wider Lesbos community, there's also growing anger over the continued migrant presence. The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party has stoked it, organising protests and exploiting the tension. It could prompt more flare-ups here. With the burnt tents removed and new ones brought in, Moria has an air of permanence. There are holes in the fences - the residents sometimes wander out, through the litter-strewn forest around it. But there's little place to go.

John Kirk, 26, had slept for only a few hours in the previous 31 and ploughed into Mr Nimmo's Volvo and a Ford Focus, Teesside Crown Court was told. Kirk, of Boston, Lincolnshire, was jailed for five years for causing death by dangerous driving. Mr Nimmo, from Murton, had been involved in a minor collision with the Ford Focus and was parked on the hard shoulder exchanging details with its driver, Lada Khazanovych, 38. Kirk's Skania articulated lorry smashed into them at around 05:25 BST - killing Mr Nimmo instantly while Ms Khazanovych suffered serious leg injuries and a cut to her scalp. Prosecutor Shaun Dodds said Kirk had been driving back to Spalding from Washington in good conditions and daylight. In the aftermath, Kirk admitted to police: \"I was nodding\". Analysis of his phone showed he had accessed porn sites on the outgoing drive to Washington and he had made a 40-minute phone call despite not having a hands-free kit, the court was told. The defendant had altered his tachograph and was flouting rules about breaks and minimum daily and weekly rest periods, the court heard. Matthew Gent, defending, said Kirk had been overworking and had a second job as a printer, as he wanted to make a better life for him and his wife, who has since left him. He pleaded guilty on a previous occasion to causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and falsely recording rest days.

Sunday's game was postponed due to a fake bomb left in a stadium toilet. Fans said many people were unable to attend the re-arranged game due to work and family commitments. There were plenty of empty seats. Bournemouth fan Steve Baxter said: \"I came with 14 on Sunday but I'm the only one here.\" But others such as self-employed Stephen Large and Gary Hickson decided to make one more trip. \"I have been to every game this season and I'm not going to miss this one,\" he said. Mr Hickson added; \"When we evacuated the stadium I left my programme on the seat and want to go back for another one.\" The men said their 12-year-old sons had not been able to make the trip. Man Utd fan Moses Kamara, from Sierra Leone, whose dream trip to watch United on Sunday was ruined, paid tribute to the fans who have helped him watch the rematch. \"I am so happy, I have had an incredible day,\" he said. The fan, whose 3,000 mile (4,800km) trip ended in tears initially, has been looked after by the Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST), which provided accommodation  and raised funds for the flight home. \"They have treated me so well,\" he said. Before that match he was taken round the club museum and also made a pilgrimage to the grave of legendary former United boss Sir Matt Busby. \"It was awesome to go the grave of such a great man,\" he said.

Cyclist David Jones called the cancellation a \"disappointing end to an amazing few days\". The match on Tuesday finished with United beating Bournemouth 3-1.

{"article": "\"Well, I suppose Jeremy will need a Chief of Staff, won't he?\" joked John McTernan, a former adviser to Tony Blair, on his way into seeing his old boss set out his diagnosis of Labour's problems. Hours earlier, Mr McTernan had described Labour MPs who offered left winger Jeremy Corbyn their support just to ensure he made the shortlist of Labour candidates, rather than because they supported him, as \"morons\". Other occasions, when talking to Labour MPs, resemble a wake: lots of animated talk about the past, just don't mention the future. Sometimes as a political correspondent, the most telling remarks, the best quotes, are muttered in private conversations you have with politicians. It is what we call being off the record - we offer the politician anonymity, in exchange for complete candour from them. But who needs off the record with lines like this: Tony Blair was asked about Jeremy Corbyn's outlook: \"People say, my heart says I really should be with that politics. Well get a transplant, because that's just daft.\" \"We are in danger of becoming the political equivalent of Millwall Football Club. Their chant? `No one likes us, we don't care.' So said shadow cabinet minister Mary Creagh in the New Statesman. The message has even crossed the Atlantic: \"My party is suffering a relapse,\" the Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna has told an audience in Washington. So what is going on? This is about so, so much more than a single YouGov poll - suggesting Jeremy Corbyn might win the Labour leadership - which may turn out to be drivel. It is, instead, about something much, much deeper. The other day on Radio 4's Today Programme, I described what was happening to Labour as \"the cries of pain of a party still deeply wounded after its heavy election defeat\". One or two Labour activists accused me of indulging in a spot of journalistic hyperbole. And let's be honest, that kind of accusation levelled at a reporter is often a fair cop. It was nothing more than a difference of opinion, some listeners told me. Well, it was definitely a difference of opinion. But here are ten reasons why it might be a symptom of much more than that: 1) Labour's defeat was, to many, unexpected. 2) The scale of Labour's defeat was, to many, more unexpected still. Net result: gloomy activists wonder what the future holds. 3) Those on the right of the party say the reason is obvious: Labour was too left wing. Net result: They argue the party has to move to the right, and point passionately and in no uncertain terms to Tony Blair as proof of it. 4) Those on the left of the party say the reason is obvious: Labour was too right wing. Net result: They argue the party has to move to the left, and point passionately and in no uncertain terms to the SNP's success as proof of it. 5) So who's the enemy for Labour? It depends who you ask. 6) A chunk of the Labour movement, its left, has, for years, felt sidelined, belittled, scorned and ignored. Suddenly, in Jeremy Corbyn, they have a standard bearer with a platform, offering a clear, socialist platform. Net result: He can give straight answers to straight questions, his supporters are upbeat and in the spotlight, his three rivals do rather more caveating, triangulating and not answering questions so clearly. Or even, whisper their critics, are being boring and saying nothing. 7) Two of the Labour leadership candidates, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, served as Chief Secretary to the Treasury when Labour was in government, at a time when Labour faces questions about its economic credibility because of its time in government. One, Andy Burnham, was also Health Secretary - meaning questions about the deaths at Stafford Hospital would keep coming too. Net result: Some Labour activists fret these are hostages to fortune. 8) Supporters of Ed Miliband said one of his greatest achievements was keeping the party united. Net result: this internal combustion has been a long time coming 9) Conservatives are gleeful - and quickly nicking as many Labour policies they think are worth nicking as they can Net result: when Tories are cranking up the minimum wage and talking about 'one nation,' where is the turf for Labour, mutter some. 10) Throw one to nine into the pot, shake, stir, throw in an added dose of 1 and 2 and you arrive at... the current situation.", "question": "The only smiles you see on the faces of Labour types at the moment is when there 's a spot of gallows @placeholder .", "option_0": "events", "option_1": "behaviour", "option_2": "phenomenon", "option_3": "shows", "option_4": "humour", "label": 4}

Chan plays Ruth, the wife of Teddy, the eldest and most successful of three sons who has returned to London from the US where he is greeted by his physically and mentally abusive father and his brothers and uncle. Yes it's full on, it doesn't let up at all - you can't drop your concentration for a second. It's a wonderful play because there's no fat on there. In every moment there is something going on, the power is shifting or the dynamics of the scene. I've not watched it from the outside but when you're in it, it's very full on. It's wonderful writing and Pinter, in a way, these characters he created - particularly the male characters and their attitudes and the way they behave - it's still quite shocking. I can't imagine how shocking it would have been in 1965 but I think he created characters that are still incredibly interesting. The traits that you see in certain characters you can still see in society today. I still think the play's got something to say and I love my character - she's been fascinating to explore and try and understand where she's coming from. A lot of people think she's controversial and ask why she behaves the way she behaves, and it's been really interesting trying to work that out. There is a lot of ambiguity with the character and in [Pinter's] text, but as you work on it you have to make choices and decide what your truth is. It was interesting to work with [director] Jamie [Lloyd] and the other actors to say: \"What is the truth with these characters, what's happened between Teddy and Ruth and their marriage?\" It could well change. We've got three months to go and I have my own ideas of what she might do next and I'm looking forward to getting to grips with that. I've loved it. I love a pause and a silence so I will happily milk those. But Jamie said to us when we were rehearsing: \"You've got to explore why the pause might be there, they're not just there by coincidence.\" He's put them there for a reason - sometimes it might just be because he thinks there will be a laugh, other times there's something going on between the characters and you have to allow that to be alive on stage. It's been really technical but once you have examined it forensically, you can then just enjoy what he's written. I'm the same age as John Macmillan (who plays amateur boxer Joey) but I can't compete with their anecdotes during rehearsal, they have a few between them. They have been wonderful - there are quite a few personalities in there but I can honestly say that we didn't fall out once, which was great. All the drama was in the scenes, there's been a lot of laughter. I don't know, I haven't really got a master plan. After this, I have to do Humans series two and that's five months of next year. Then I'm open to to anything interesting that comes up. Absolutely, I have a love/hate relationship with technology. It's frightening how much we rely on it but how little we understand it and when it breaks, we're screwed because we don't know how to fix it. I hate that but at the same time, I couldn't live with without it. I think the show's resonated with people because of their dependence on and wariness of rapidly advancing technology. I haven't, I've heard some rumours but they are keeping me in the dark too. I'd love to see it expand and to see what's going on in other parts of the world. I'd love the characters to be moving on and exploring, particularly my character. I've heard that the scripts are very good though.

{"article": "They had a date with fellow relegation candidates Motherwell, and with only one home win and just 12 Scottish Premiership points all season, the gift of three points was essential. Defeat would have left them nine points adrift of Motherwell and, as results turned out, six behind St Mirren. How the Buddies must wish things had gone differently. Few would have imagined that Ross County would recover from a defeat. A play-off would have seemed the best possible outcome to avoid relegation. As it turned out, a fiercely contested match ended in euphoria, a 3-2 win that brought hope, tempered by the realisation that they still needed an almost miraculous turnaround to prevent a slide into the Championship. Up until then, season 2014-15 had been fairly wretched for all connected to the Dingwall club. Derek Adams, after a largely successful period in charge, was relieved of his duties following four consecutive league defeats at the start of the campaign. Chairman Roy MacGregor described the decision to end his reign as \"the most difficult decision I've ever had to make in football\". It was clear that he wanted the club to take a different direction on and off the park and he acted decisively. Jim McIntyre was recruited from a successful spell at Queen of the South and has just begun his second year in charge. As he sits within the stadium, McIntyre has a look of satisfaction at what has happened since that pivotal date in mid-February. \"When we came in the door the remit was to stay up,\" he told BBC Scotland. \"The run we put together was fantastic.\" In a game full of opinion and counter-claim, no-one can dispute the impressiveness of their achievements. A sequence of eight wins and a draw in nine games meant they could not be automatically relegated, but with other teams responding to the threat of a relegation play-off the Staggies' top-flight safety was only secured with a game to spare. \"That allows you to build,\" McIntyre continued. \"We've certainly done that in terms of the infrastructure of the club and improving the squad.\" There have been difficult decisions along the way. Club captain Richie Brittain was released with a host of players. The management team moved swiftly to recruit and re-sign the talent they believed would improve their standing in the top division. At this stage it seems to be working. Fans in the Highlands are starting to whisper about a potential top-six finish. Who would have thought that six months or so ago? \"We managed to start the season the way we ended it,\" said McIntyre. \"We've shown decent consistency. We know there's a long way to go.\" They sit fourth in the table at this early stage of the season. While not quite on the winning run of last season, they seem capable of at least challenging the top six. From that crucial win over Motherwell, County have gathered 43 points from a possible 63, about two points a game on average. Does that raise expectation and targets? \"We have targets that we set at the start of the season which will remain private,\" the manager reluctantly offered. \"We need to work ever so hard to try and achieve them. \"Come the end of the season, if we've met them we'll know if it's been a successful year or not.\" Who knows how far they'll go on a journey that's promising a very different experience this season compared to the tension of last.", "question": "Valentine 's Day can , for some , be fraught , but Ross County can look back on 14 February of this year with @placeholder .", "option_0": "affection", "option_1": "facts", "option_2": "emotion", "option_3": "fluid", "option_4": "title", "label": 0}
{"article": "Hamilton won the Abu Dhabi GP driving slowly in an attempt to bring other drivers into the battle, knowing he needed Rosberg to finish below third. Hamilton was repeatedly told to speed up but told the team: \"Let us race.\" Rosberg came under pressure from Sebastian Vettel but held off the Ferrari driver to finish second. Hamilton controlled the race from the front but was under instruction from Mercedes management not to try any strategic games to delay Rosberg. However, he disregarded message after message to speed up and prevent Vettel and Red Bull's Max Verstappen from closing on Rosberg. The German in turn complained on the radio to the team to \"consider doing something\" and the tense title battle will do nothing to improve the cool relationship between the two drivers. At one point, as Vettel homed in on Rosberg in the closing laps, Mercedes executive director (technical) Paddy Lowe, who only speaks to the drivers on the radio in extreme circumstances, told Hamilton: \"Lewis, this is Paddy. We need you to pick up the pace to win this race.\" Hamilton replied: \"I'm in the lead right now. I'm quite comfortable where I am.\" But his tactics were not enough and Rosberg whooped with delight as he crossed the line and, after wife Vivian congratulated him over the radio, did doughnut spins on the pit straight before climbing on to the nose of the car to take the cheers from the crowd. \"It's a childhood dream come true,\" Rosberg, 31, said over the radio. \"Thank you for everything.\" After the drama of the race, Hamilton congratulated Rosberg on his world championship and the two men embraced and shook hands on the podium. Rosberg said he had not decided whether to take the number one on his car as is his right next year or whether to stick with the number six, which he chose as his race number because his father Keke won the 1982 world title with it. The Rosbergs are only the second family in which a father and son have won the F1 world title, after Graham and Damon Hill. Rosberg started the race 12 points ahead of Hamilton, and knew a podium finish would be enough to secure the championship regardless of what Hamilton did. It initially looked as though he would be able to cruise to an easy climax to the best season of his career, but it did not take long for the tension to mount. Hamilton and Rosberg both made good starts to convert first and second places on the grid into a one-two from the start. But the difficult moments for Rosberg began when he came out from his first pit stop behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen. After a spin at the first corner of the race, the Red Bull driver recovered ground quickly and, running a long first stint as a prelude to a one-stop race, ended up in second place behind Hamilton after the leaders had finished their first pit stops. Rosberg came out right behind Verstappen, and was also under pressure from behind from Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, and Vettel. Ricciardo attacked Raikkonen intermittently, without managing a pass, but Rosberg was able to stay out of the Ferrari's reach and the Finn never got close enough to try the same to the Mercedes. Rosberg tried to pass Verstappen two laps after his pit stop but the Dutchman defended aggressively and the championship leader decided discretion was the better part of valour and sat back looking after his tyres. However, as Verstappen's stint grew longer and longer, Mercedes realised they were at risk of losing second place to him because he could make his one stop for tyres and still come out in front. Rosberg was told on lap 19 that passing the Red Bull was \"critical\" and he responded by passing Verstappen on the next lap to take the second place he would hold to the end. Hamilton continued to lap only just as fast as he needed, balancing his vain hope that other drivers might be able to get among the two Mercedes with instructions from his team not to drive too slowly and force the issue. As the race progressed, Hamilton went slower and slower and the team began to worry that a one-two was at risk. This ensured Verstappen was never more than about three seconds behind, with Ricciardo closing on him and, in the final stint, Vettel attacking both. With 11 laps to go, Hamilton was warned to pick up the pace because Vettel was an \"imminent threat\". At the time, Vettel was running in fifth place but was closing rapidly on Verstappen and Ricciardo in third and fourth places because the four-time champion had done a long middle stint and fitted super-soft tyres for his final stint, while the others were on the more durable but slower soft tyres. He passed both but was not quite close enough on the last lap to make an attack on Rosberg work. \"It was a tricky situation at the end with Lewis playing dirty tricks,\" Vettel said to his team as they congratulated him over the radio. \"It was tough out there. I didn't want to be an issue. But at the end I was thinking maybe to try to pass both of them but it didn't work out.\" Hamilton denied using dirty tricks to hamper Rosberg. Jenson Button's final grand prix came to an early end when his McLaren's front suspension broke as he bounced over a kerb on lap 12. Button said: \"The result doesn't count. The weekend does. It has been awesome, from the fans, to before the race, a load of the team lined up and I walked between them and they clapped me into the garage. Very emotional, not the easiest thing before a grand prix. An amazing day and an amazing weekend.\" Williams driver Felipe Massa, who is also retiring from F1, finished ninth, fending off a late attack from former Ferrari team-mate Fernando Alonso's McLaren. His long-time friend and engineer Rob Smedley praised him on the radio afterwards, saying he had had a \"great drive\".

{"article": "Picture gallery: How to get the best from Bangkok's street food Working Lives: Bangkok Your pictures: Thailand In pictures: Bangkok's street food More from Thailand Direct I have just been on a tour of Bangkok with Chawadee Nualkhair, or 'Chow', as she appropriately likes to call herself. Chow is a Thai brought up in the USA who returned to Bangkok as an adult and developed a passion for street food. She writes a blog and has published a book about the top 50 places to grab a bite along the road. We managed eight places, until we were too stuffed to walk. First, to Banglamphu, in old Bangkok. This area is popular with tourists, particularly around Khao San Road, but it also has some of the best casual eating spots in the city. Chow took me to Somsong Pochana, near the Chaophraya River, which is renowned for its Sukhothai noodles. These are thin rice noodles, in a pork broth sweetened with palm sugar, tamarind, slices of pork, crunchy green beans, topped with peanuts. I asked Chow what was the key to getting this dish right. \"It's got to be spicy, but not overpoweringly, tart from the tamarind, sweet from the sugar,\" she says. \"Roasted peanuts for texture - you need to get the balance just right. That's what I love about Thai food. They pay attention to detail - the balance of flavours, texture, aroma, how it feels on the tongue.\" The chef at Somsong Pochana also served me kanom jin saonam, an unusual and hard-to-find dish these days: fermented rice noodles, topped with coconut cream, masses of raw, sliced garlic, pineapple, chillies and dried shrimp. An amazing mix of flavours, but delicious! Chunks of chicken and pork are skewered onto bamboo with expert precision and speed Next towards Hualampong Station, Bangkok's main railway terminus, for pork sate at Chongki. Sate is a Malay/Indonesian dish, although of course as Muslims they use chicken or goat meat, rather than pork. A row of young women sit in the corner of Chongki, quickly skewering the chunks of pork or liver onto thin bamboo sticks. It's marinated in sweet coconut cream, grilled over a smoky barbecue, and dipped in a peanut sauce, the recipe for which is a secret closely guarded by Chongki. Thais will tell you that all their food should have a balance of four flavours - sweet, salty, sour and spicy - and the sauce seems to have all these. We moved on, to a little cafÃ© called Nai Mong Hoy Tod, just off Charoen Krung, the main road in Bangkok's Chinatown. Hoy tod is one of many Thai street dishes with its origins in China - brought by the influx of Chinese immigrants a century or so ago. It's an omelette, filled with local oysters or mussels, cooked on a hot griddle. A wonderful snack, but like many casual Thai dishes, be sure to specify if you don't want the cook to put MSG in it. Even good cooks do this in many parts of Thailand. Chow likes her omelette super crispy, which she assures me is a feminine trait. Real men, apparently, like their oyster omelettes soft and sloppy. If you are after dessert, there is nothing more cheerful than nam kaeng sai - shaved ice, piles of multi-coloured jelly bits, strings of dough, crunchy water chestnuts, ginko beans, with salty-sweet coconut cream on top. In pictures: Bangkok's street food And there is nowhere better to have it than Seng Sim Ee, in Suan Luang market, behind Chulalongkorn University. Don't be put off by the swarms of bees clustering around the bowls of ingredients - it is a richly refreshing dish, well worth the trip. I asked Chow what she looked for in a street stall or restaurant. \"Hygiene is the first thing I check. Are the condiment jars clean? Have the tables been wiped? What about the food preparation areas.\" I have been eating street food in Thailand for more than a decade, and I have never once had an upset stomach. Hygiene standards may not seem to be up to top restaurant standards, but I suspect there is not much between them. The best street stalls do care a lot about keeping their cooking clean and safe. Another dish that has come from China is 'jok' - rice porridge, or congee. And most Bangkok residents will tell you that the place to go is Jok Samyan, also behind the university. Outside the cafÃ©, a woman stirs an enormous pot of simmering rice that has been stewed to a sticky, soupy consistency. Next to her is an equally large pot of pork-bone soup. Thais like to add minced pork-balls, and a raw egg, with crispy bits of fried dough on top. It's irresistible - real comfort food. \"It's the quality of their meatballs - they're very well seasoned - that makes this restaurant so famous,\" says Chow. Few dishes are as well-known in Thailand as phad thai. This fried noodle recipe originates from an attempt by a nationalist Thai leader in the 1940s to give noodles - a Chinese import - a more 'Thai' flavour, by holding a competition. Phad thai was the result. In pictures: Bangkok's street food Cooked in a searingly-hot wok, the noodles are fried with bean curd, garlic chives, dried shrimp, then tamarind juice and palm sugar are added, and it is served with chillies, nam plaa - the ubiquitous fermented fish sauce - bean sprouts, banana blossom and coriander leaves. At Thip Samai, back in Banglamphu, perhaps the most famous phad thai restaurant, they keep at least two woks going on charcoal stoves, producing a phad thai every minute. Then, in a trademark twist, a woman coats another wok with egg, and with two flicks of her spatula, ingeniously wraps the noodles in a neat, egg bag. Like so much fried street cuisine, this is not health food, but it is irresistibly delicious. Round the corner from Thip Samai is one of the city's most famous street chefs, Jay Fai. Jay Fai's food is worth the price tag She's been called the 'Mozart of the Wok', and watching her stoking her charcoal stove to blast-furnace intensity, and tossing ingredients into a wok or saucepan with lightning speed, it is easy to see why. The dishes at Jay Fai are more expensive than other street food. A plate of phad kee mao - 'drunken noodles' - will set you back US$10. But eating it is the closest to noodle heaven I have ever been. Thick slices of chilli and onion, a rich, smoky gravy, succulent prawns and glistening noodles, all cooked in a matter of seconds. Perfectly balanced, wonderfully fresh. Her tom yam gung, sour prawn soup, is legendary, and priced to match. Finally, no Thai food odyssey would be complete without som tam, the fiery salad of grated, green papaya from Thailand's north-east. Among the best places to get it is Hai Somtam, in Soi Convent, just off Silom Road. The papaya is pounded with raw garlic, chillies, fish sauce, lime juice, and small tomatoes, and for an especially pungent flavour, a raw, fresh-water crab is thrown into the mix. Eat with small baskets of sticky rice. A true taste of Thailand, uncompromising and unmistakable.", "question": "Food - specifically Thai cooking - should be one of the @placeholder of any visit to Bangkok .

{"article": "BBC Sport takes a look at the stories you may have missed from Saturday's action. Forty years ago this week a raw, no-nonsense 18-year-old centre-back by the name of Mick McCarthy was making his debut for Barnsley in a 4-0 win over Rochdale. The Ipswich Town manager had been marking that football landmark in fine style, until Saturday's 2-0 home defeat against Fulham put an end to his side's 100% start to the league season. Following an impressive playing career at club and international level with the Republic of Ireland, the Yorkshireman has been in charge for almost 900 matches in the top two tiers of English football, as well as leading his adopted country to the last 16 of the 2002 World Cup. But it is the man whose boots he used to clean who now boasts the only perfect record in the Championship. Can you spot McCarthy's fellow Championship manager below? McCarthy, 58, was a certain Neil Warnock's apprentice during his early years at the Tykes and, incredibly, between them they have managed more than one-third of the teams currently in England's second tier. Warnock's Cardiff City lead the way on their own now, with five wins from five thanks to a 2-1 success against QPR. And here's a quiz question bonus for you. Can you name the nine second-tier sides the pair have managed? Answers at the bottom of the page. After a total of 439 minutes* spanning more than four and a half league and cup games this season, Gillingham finally scored a goal on Saturday. In fact they got three. Well, Tom Eaves did to be precise, netting a hat-trick - and his first goals for the club - inside 24 second-half minutes. Eaves' efforts saw the Gills twice come from behind to earn a 3-3 draw against Southend United. Not to be outdone by Eaves, Newport County's Frank Nouble also grabbed a hat-trick - marking his home debut in style as his side beat Chesterfield 4-1. Coming through the ranks at Chelsea, the Exiles are Nouble's 13th British club, with a brief spell in China sandwiched in between. The South Wales air certainly seems to agree with him. Maybe his treble will help the much-travelled 25-year-old forward settle? *Not counting Gillingham's 0-0 draw on the final day of last season, or the 25 goalless minutes in the game before that. Every new signing dreams of scoring on their debut, but Burton Albion loanee Joe Mason took that to the next level in his side's 1-1 draw with Sheffield Wednesday. Not only did the striker equalise for the Brewers, he did so only 31 seconds after being brought on at the Pirelli Stadium. Seconds after jogging on, Mason was allowed space in the area to shoot on the turn, converting after Gary Hooper had put the visitors ahead with a close-range backheel. Mason had not scored since January. How is he going to follow up that first impression? Grimsby Town's players are either very unlucky or need to brush up on the laws of the game following their fifth red card in five matches this season. Danny Collins was guilty of two bookable offences in the Mariners' 3-2 home defeat against Wycombe after a handball in the penalty area and a bad foul on Matt Bloomfield. Early baths for Ben Davies, Sam Jones, James Berrett and Zak Mills in the four previous league and cup matches mean Collins' dismissal kept up the unwanted 100% record. Grimsby now find themselves third from bottom in League Two and will hope to move themselves back up the table before they run out of available players. Northampton Town's start to a season seemingly so full of promise has been miserable to say the least. With Matt Crooks and Matt Grimes headlining a host of summer signings, hopes were high for a positive campaign in League One. Four games in and Justin Edinburgh's side are one of only two teams in the EFL yet to register a single point. Saturday's 4-1 home loss against high-flying Peterborough United means the rock-bottom Cobblers have now lost all four league matches, conceding 10 goals and scoring two. Under-pressure boss Edinburgh told BBC Radio Northampton: \"We are in this together. We will never isolate anybody. We have let ourselves down, we have let the fans down and the football club. I accept all the responsibility. \"I have had to work hard in my career as a player and a manager and I am not going to give it up lightly. \"If we are going to get the result that we need we certainly have to defend better than we have. We were so, so poor in the goals we gave away. I understand the frustration but the only way you get through it is by sticking together.\" At least the Cobblers are not alone at the foot of the third tier. Oldham Athletic's 2-1 loss to Blackpool means they also have no points but remain above Northampton on goal difference. Did you get the nine Championship clubs managed by either Mick McCarthy or Neil Warnock? They are: Cardiff, Ipswich, Wolves, Leeds, QPR, Sheffield United, Sunderland, Millwall and Burton.

{"article": "The UK Independence Party was founded in 1993 with one main goal: to take the UK out of the European Union. Back then, the idea was way outside the political mainstream. But on 23 June the country narrowly voted to leave and Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to implement the people's decision. So what is the point of UKIP after Brexit? Leader Paul Nuttall will have three main priorities for the year ahead as it faces a potentially tricky set of local elections, defending many of the council seats won in the 2013 surge: \"Brexit means Brexit,\" says Mrs May, but as of yet, we don't know many more details. She says she will trigger Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty before the end of March, starting two years of divorce negotiations. But there are many unresolved questions. Should the UK continue to pay into the European budget and accept the free movement of people, in exchange for closer economic ties? Or should it pursue what some call a \"clean\" and others a \"hard\" Brexit, severing the link more definitively? UKIP is firmly in the second camp. \"The British people voted for Brexit, so we could control our borders, leave the single market, and create our own laws,\" the party says. It will be on hair-trigger alert in 2017, ready to campaign against anything it sees as Brexit backsliding from the government. Despite its remarkable successes in 2016, at times UKIP resembled a circular firing squad. Nigel Farage, UKIP's longest-serving leader and best known public face, does not get on with the party's only MP Douglas Carswell, or former deputy chair Suzanne Evans. Diane James resigned as leader in October only 18 days into the job, causing Mr Farage to take over on an interim basis before Mr Nuttall's election. It is hard to keep track of the various alliances and schisms. Ideological differences exist within UKIP like in all parties. But often the differences seem to be more personal than political. The party's most ignominious fight - whether it  was a literal one or not - of 2016 saw one-time leadership favourite Steven Woolfe in hospital in October following an alleged \"altercation\" with fellow MEP Mike Hookem at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Mr Woolfe subsequently left the party, saying it was \"ungovernable\" and in a \"death spiral\". But an internal report by the party said it could not \"verify\" whether a fight had taken place, and Mr Hookem denied striking his colleague. If UKIP is to remain a serious force, Mr Nuttall will have to contain these sorts of tensions. After comfortably winning his leadership election in November, two days shy of his 40th birthday, he has appointed a team from across the party. Things seem more stable than at any time since the referendum. For now. UKIP began as a thorn in the side of the Conservative Party. But in recent years the party has had Labour voters in its sights, gaining ground in northern England and Wales. Lots of Labour-supporting areas voted Leave in June, even though the party officially backed Remain. Also, many of those who did not vote in the 2015 general election did in fact turn out for the EU referendum - and according to NatCen research a lot more of them backed Leave than backed Remain. Mr Nuttall, who has working-class Northern roots, thinks these voters are closer to UKIP than Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party on policy areas such as immigration, the EU and welfare. UKIP will be hoping to win some of its support in 2017, causing existential problems for Labour. A by-election early in the new year in Copeland in Cumbria, which voted Labour in 2015 and Leave in 2016, will give an early sign of whether this approach is working. After one of the craziest years in British political history, the party will be hoping for a calmer 2017. But with UKIP, you can never quite be sure what lurks around the corner.", "question": "Is UKIP the most successful party in the history of British politics ?

{"article": "Hungary will propose that each of the 28 EU members pays 1% of its income from the Union, plus 1% of its contributions to it, into a special fund. In Hungary's case, that would amount to â‚¬1bn (Â£720m; $1.1bn). Close to 250,000 migrants have entered Hungary this year - 70,000 this month alone - and it has become a transit state on the Western Balkan route to Germany and other EU destinations. The government has tried to stop migrants coming by erecting a border fence and giving the army extra powers to keep them out. And, along with three other Central European states, Hungary has been outvoted on an EU quota plan for taking in another 120,000 refugees. The proposed special fund would be used, Mr Orban will argue, to improve conditions in the refugee camps in countries neighbouring Syria - especially Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan - and to bolster Europe's external borders. Orban: Europe's borders threatened by migrants Why EU deal on migrants is so tricky Why Central Europe says No The Hungarian plan rests on two premises. That European voters share his view that the ongoing influx would change Europe beyond recognition, if allowed to continue, and that they don't want that. And that if conditions improve where they are, the migrants will stay there, in the hope that they can one day rebuild Syria. The Hungarian prime minister clearly also hopes that the plan will prove his own fence-building approach right - that Europe should defend its borders first, before it even starts discussing quotas. He may also add that Hungary would be willing to accept a voluntary quota, if his proposal or parts of it are accepted. The Orban proposal may be too much, too late for other European leaders. Despite fierce anti-migrant rhetoric and an ever-lengthening border fence, the Budapest government has failed to stop the influx of migrants, other EU leaders may point out.

It calls for the UK voting system to be changed to one of proportional representation, saying the current set up has \"failed voters\".

UKIP leader Nigel Farage - who was at Downing Street to deliver the petition - said the results highlighted the need for change. \"This campaign for electoral reform is vital, now,\" said Mr Farage, who was joined by UKIP deputy chairwoman Suzanne Evans and the party's only MP, Douglas Carswell. \"The results of the general election where five million votes, the views of five million people are now represented by only two MPs; four million people voted for UKIP, for only one seat. It cannot go on like this,\" he said. Mr Carswell, MP for Clacton, added that the case for electoral reform was \"strong\" and believed that \"a broad cross-party coalition\" would help to secure change. Greens leader Natalie Bennett called for a \"total rethink\" of the way we vote, saying her party would have secured at least 24 MPs on 7 May if the UK had \"a fair voting system\". \"The recent election has demonstrated that we need real change in our constitution,\" she said. Meanwhile, the SNP's Westminster leader, Angus Robertson also added his support to the case for reform. He acknowledged the current voting system had delivered a virtual landslide for his party in Scotland, where the SNP 56 of the 59 seats up for grabs - but said the system was unfair. \"From an unrepresentative voting system to the unelected House of Lords, SNP MPs will be a strong voice in the coming years for the change we need to see,\" the MP said. Representatives of the Lib Dems, who have long-campaigned for a move to proportional representations, were also present. Party president Baroness Brinton said that while she disagreed with UKIP's policies it was \"outrageous\" that its four million votes only resulted in one MP. Electoral Reform Society chief executive Katie Ghose, who stood for Labour in the general election, said the outcome was \"the least proportional result in history\". \"That's because our two-party electoral system cannot cope with the fact that people want to vote for a variety of parties,\" she added.", "question": "UKIP has joined @placeholder with the Greens and other parties to petition the government over voting reform .", "option_0": "parties", "option_1": "forces", "option_2": "agreement", "option_3": "associated", "option_4": "tension", "label": 1}
{"article": "This is reflected by the fact that the opening weeks of this government have been dominated by initiatives to get the health service back on an even keel by driving down costs by targeting areas such as spending on agency staff. But dig a little deeper and there is a fascinating parallel debate going on about just how ambitious and radical the health service should be. It centres on this: to what extent should the NHS think outside the box as a way of preventing ill-health? There was a sense of this during last week's annual conference of the NHS Confederation, the body which represents health service managers. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens spoke about the need to focus on health as well as ill-health. He cited the example of child obesity to make his point, saying if this was not tackled it would lead to a tide of new cases of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. He urged the NHS to \"rattle the cage and try something different\". But he could have chosen a range of other issues from smoking to drinking. The theme cropped up again in a separate debate on the devolution of public spending in Greater Manchester. Philip Blond, director of ResPublica, a think tank which has been looking into the case for change in the region, spoke about his desire to see the health service intervening early to prevent people developing health problems in the first place. He floated the idea of GPs being able to refer patients for home insulation as a way of keeping their homes warm. It may sound fanciful, but consider this: research shows cold, damp and dangerous homes cost the NHS Â£2.5bn a year. Not only do they increase the risk of respiratory problems, but hazards in the home are the most common reasons for falls among the elderly. Some areas have already looked at these things. In Liverpool the council and the NHS have been working together on a Healthy Homes Programme since 2009. Last year in Sunderland, doctors began offering help with insulation, double-glazing and boilers and started seeing some falls in demand. There is also growing interest in social prescribing, whereby GPs refer patients on to knitting clubs and fishing groups, as a way of tackling problems such as depression. Offering befriending services is another novel idea that is growing in popularity as a way of tackling social isolation among the elderly, which is increasingly been recognised as a risk factor for ill-health and death. In health circles, it all comes under the umbrella of what is called \"upstream\" intervention.  That is to say supporting people before their conditions worsen and they end up in hospital or a care home, which are the two most expensive ends of the health and care sectors. This agenda requires the NHS to work with local partners, particularly councils. The big unknown though - as the pressure on the service intensifies in the coming years - is whether there will be the breathing space for it to do so.", "question": "With mounting deficits , an @placeholder population and Â £ 22bn of \" efficiency savings \" to find in the next five years , the NHS is facing a monumental task .", "option_0": "expanded", "option_1": "craft", "option_2": "ageing", "option_3": "air", "option_4": "estimated", "label": 2}
{"article": "Midfielder James McCarthy's sublime 20-yard finish, following Kieran Dowell's run, put the Toffees on their way to a sixth home league win of the season. Leighton Baines' penalty made it 2-0 after Romelu Lukaku was fouled by Robbie Brady before Kevin Mirallas tapped home the third. Norwich finish 19th in the table. Reaction from Goodison Park and all of Sunday's Premier League games Relive the action from Goodison Park Former Everton defender David Unsworth, assisted by one-time Goodison manager Joe Royle, took temporary charge, with Martinez having been dismissed after a run of one win in 10 Premier League games. The season had started with talk of silverware. It ends with the club managerless, a bottom-half finish in the table, and Goodison Park's trophy cabinet gathering dust. Major shareholder Farhad Moshiri must find someone capable of ending the club's 21-year trophy drought, and former Ajax boss Frank de Boer and Southampton manager Ronald Koeman have been linked with the job. Whoever takes over will find a squad full of potential, with teenage midfielders Kieran Dowell, 18, Tom Davies, 17, and defender Jonjoe Kenny, 19, all playing a role in a rare Everton home victory. It was Dowell's powerful run which led to McCarthy breaking the deadlock from distance. And Dowell, Davies and Kenny were all involved in the build-up which led to Mirallas tapping home the third goal. As they seek a new manager, Everton said farewell to long-serving goalkeeper Tim Howard, who is joining Colorado Rapids in Major League Soccer on 1 July. The 37-year-old was rarely troubled as his 414th and final Toffees appearance ended with a clean sheet, with the hosts dominating for long periods. Striker Arouna Kone's future looks anything but certain while forward Oumar Niasse, signed in a £13.5m deal from Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow three months ago, has yet to deliver and was arrested in the build-up to this match. In terms of points, Everton end the season closer to the relegation zone than the top eight. Whoever is appointed the next manager, a big summer of change lies ahead. Norwich are heading back to the Championship after losing five of their final six top-flight games. This performance was as poor as any they have produced all season and will not have filled their travelling fans with much confidence about making an immediate return to the Premier League. Their manager Alex Neil wanted a performance to reward the fans for their backing. His demands fell on deaf ears. Still, Norwich could do worse than take a leaf out of Burnley's book and keep faith with Neil for next season. Last season, the Clarets did the same with Sean Dyche after suffering relegation and are now planning a return to the top level. Everton joint-interim manager David Unsworth: \"If there was a script and I could have written it, it would have been exactly what happened today. I thought we were fantastic. \"I'm very proud. I was delighted the team put that performance in and got the win. Even more so that we got the clean sheet for Tim [Howard]. Media playback is not supported on this device \"It was a fitting ovation for Tim on the pitch. The players have done the same in the dressing room as well, which was a lovely touch.\" Everton's departing goalkeeper Tim Howard: \"This is a place I love, it is hard to leave.

{"article": "If passed into legislation, the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Bill, proposed by the DUP's Lord Morrow, would make Northern Ireland the lead in the UK on human trafficking law. The bill aims to enhance services for victims as well as making it an offence to pay for sexual services from a prostitute. The consultation period ends on 18 October. Buying or selling sex is legal across the UK, however, many activities related to prostitution, including kerb crawling, running a brothel and pimping, are all outlawed. Lord Morrow said it was illegal to pay for sex in Northern Ireland from someone who has been coerced. \"The majority of rescued victims of trafficking in Northern Ireland are those brought here for sexual exploitation and I believe that we can do better,\" he said. \"For instance, in Sweden, there's a very clear message of zero tolerance for the purchase of sex that has had a clear impact on trafficking.\" Other points in the Stormont bill include extending the definition of 'other exploitation' to include forced begging; defining a victim of trafficking and outlining compensation procedures for victims. It proposes allowing courts to take aggravating factors into consideration when passing sentence. The bill also aims to ensure child victims have a legal advocate to support them through the relevant criminal, immigration and compensation procedures, and provide special measures for trafficking victims if they act as witnesses. It will also set out what assistance and civil legal services are available to victims of trafficking, and ensure no prosecution is brought for a criminal offence committed by a trafficking victim as a direct consequence of being trafficked. Lord Morrow's bill also proposes training for police and prosecutors. It urges the Department of Justice to produce an annual strategy on raising awareness of and reducing trafficking. Public consultation is currently taking place in the Republic of Ireland about the future of legislation on prostitution. It is due to be referred to an Oireachtas committee at the end of this month.

{"article": "Thousands of commercial vessels from around the world enter UK waters every year, bringing a chance for international criminal gangs to surreptitiously move drugs over water and on to shore. If illegal substances are being smuggled, it is the job of the National Deep Rummage Team (NDRT) to find where. But vessels are vast structures with many hiding places - some are capable of carrying 14,000 containers, equal in length to a 44-mile long train. Drugs could be concealed anywhere from under a cabin bed bunk to the harder to reach places like tanks filled with liquid or buried deep within the bulkhead. Paul Tunney, the team's senior officer, said: \"It's like a giant game of hide and seek but there's no-one to tell us if we're getting warmer. \"You've got to go on board with imagination and with the mindset that you are going to find something.\" Working vessels are hostile environments and with it brings the risk of danger to rummagers. They have to climb in and inspect tanks, crawl into the vessel's inner structure or scale the hull walls of the cargo holds. Because of the specialised nature of their work, they also have to be trained in immediate life support first aid and self rescue, rather than rely on other emergency services. \"When we're on a vessel it is working, it is discharging and loading cargo so there are lots of things on the move,\" said Mr Tunney. \"If we're going into a confined space it needs to be aerated, there could be gases or a lack of oxygen in it. \"If we're going into a tank, we have to check the atmosphere of the tank and go in wearing breathing apparatus. \"People have died in accidents on vessels and we don't want that to happen to our officers.\" As crucial as hunting out and searching the confined spaces is, the 'bread and butter' of rummage work is talking to those on board. \"We talk to the captain and crew, monitor their body language, see how they feel about us being on board and take all those factors into account,\" said Mr Tunney. \"There are clues, it's just recognising them. It may be that the captain says no-one has been in a particular area but you notice footprints or you see some new piece of construction. \"Vessels don't smuggle, it's people that smuggle.\" The Border Force's NDRT formed in 2004. There are now four specialist teams based at Liverpool, Immingham, Felixstowe and Southampton. Since its launch, the teams have found some 777 kilos of class A drugs with a street value of approximately Â£155m. The teams are responding to an ever-changing shipping world. Crew previously made their fortunes smuggling tea, silk and brandy into UK ports. Now highly organised international crime groups are able to bring drugs, cigarettes and illegal immigrants into the UK. Mr Tunney said: \"Often we find people involved in smuggling are going on diving holidays thinking they can learn to dive and then collect drugs attached to the hull of vessels over here. \"Diving in water near ships is totally different to swimming in the Red Sea. \"It's an unforgiving environment and people can very quickly get disorientated.\" The team works closely with other maritime authorities, the police dive teams, the Serious Organised Crime Agency and other government departments. Vessels are selected for searching by an intelligence-driven method, with those presenting the highest risk targeted. Much of the team's success comes down to having access to the MV Altea - a ship that was impounded after being caught attempting to smuggle 17 tonnes of cannabis into the country in 1989.

{"article": "There is much more to Glastonbury than its main stages, big-name bands and thronging nightspots. The festival's fringes are filled with attractions and curiosities to explore - but you have to look hard to the find its most secret and special corners. Armed with nothing more than a pair of wellies and a sense of curiosity, I set out to track down some of Glastonbury's more mysterious night-spots. It is the stuff of Glastonbury legend - a hidden underground bar that does not appear on any maps or official guides, where well-known artists have been known to turn up for surprise sets. Armed with a little knowledge, I begin searching in the Green Crafts field, looking between and beyond the stalls where you can weave your dreams or carve a plate or make your own vegan spa products, for any sign of something that might look like an entrance to a hidden bar. After walking around the field three times, I wander into a neighbouring area. Eventually, there is an inconspicuous pathway through the trees, with some kind of doorway at the bottom. But the path is fenced off and the doorway is closed. So I come back later. With no signs and no lighting, you could easily walk close by and not realise anything is there. But this time, down the path is a queue of several dozen people leading to the hatch. The secret is clearly out. When I get near the front of the queue, a wild-looking Irish doorman who seems to go by the name Gollum is waving his little finger in the air and delivering a stream of consciousness about how Kanye West \"broke the universe\". I get to the front. \"Kiss my finger!\" Gollum demands. \"Kiss my finger! Kiss it! Get to the back of the queue if you won't kiss it. Oh, OK, go in then.\" I step past, relieved to have avoided puckering up, into a half-height, pitch black tunnel. That opens out into the bar - which is more like a Hobbit-sized dancehall, with a narrow sunken dancefloor that has been dug into the hillside, flanked by steep earthy stepped seating, and with a high stage at one end. The name is a bit misleading. There is no piano that I can see, the bar does not turn out to sell alcohol and most of it is not underground. Instead, it has long, sturdy branches - with twigs and leaves still attached - holding up a canvas roof. On stage is a band playing accordion and fiddle Balkan folk, to occasional whoops and claps from the patrons. Some are revelling in this fantasy creation. Others have looks of happy bemusement, and will at least be able to say they have found the piano bar. The other bar that is shrouded in intrigue is the Rabbit Hole. This one, in the Park area, is in the brochure. A large bar is open to all and hosts bands, but there is an inner world where weird and wonderful things are supposed to happen. And the queue is even longer. This time, I do not have time to join it. Inside, apparently, there is an Alice in Wonderland theme with a warren of tunnels and rooms, all guarded by gatekeepers dressed as characters from the book, who ask you to solve riddles before letting you through. I walk around the edge to peek inside, and see on a collection of teeming multi-coloured tents. On the edge, raised up, is a steaming hot tub that is full of people and, as far as I can make out, is presided over by the Mad Hatter. That experience can wait for next time. A woodland clearing on the festival's southern frontier, between the piano bar and Rabbit Hole, is a new area named after the late Clash frontman and Glastonbury regular Joe Strummer. It is well out of the way and, inside, a DJ on a simple wooden stage is playing lazy funk and reggae as a few people dance gently. Strummer was a regular around a Glastonbury camp fire, and in the centre of Strummerville is a blaze with a full-time warden to keep it going. It is surrounded by easy chairs and sofas where friends have settled in for the night, while others sit on the grass between the clumps of bracken. There are a few hundred people chilling out. It would be very easy to lose hours here while listening to the laid-back music and chatting to friends. I have seen signs for a sauna at Glastonbury in the past, and always thought they must be some kind of joke. But no - I follow the signs and in the corner of the tipi field is a screened-off area called Lost Horizon, which contains a wood-burning sauna in one corner, a massage tent in another, plus cold showers and a basic stage down one side. In the centre, people are sitting, talking, relaxing. Some are fully clothed. Others let it all hang out. Lost Horizon offers to cleanse mind and body. Just outside is another campfire, surrounded by rough-hewn wooden benches, where a few people sit quietly. Suddenly, the bands and crowds just down the hill seem very distant. This feels like the spiritual heart of the festival. Among the services on offer, the lady at the entrance to Lost Horizon tells me, is a naked yoga class the following morning. But that is one adventure too far for me. The real holy grail of Glastonbury - proper loos. If you are not keen on the composting toilets or long drops that usually provide relief here, seek out the two rows of flushing toilets on the northern edge of the site, near the medical centre. Pictures of Glastonbury co-founders Andrew Kerr and Arabella Churchill, who have both died in recent years, have been painted onto the ends on the ends of the two blocks. I'm not sure whether it is what they would have wanted.

{"article": "One month on, there is still a gaping hole in Turkey's political heart. And there is talk that parts of the parliament building will be kept like this: a permanent reminder of arguably the gravest attack Turkey has ever known. It was late evening on 15 July when rockets slammed into the Grand National Assembly. Rebel soldiers used F-16 fighter jets and helicopter gunships in an attempt to seize control. Tanks rolled into Ankara and Istanbul, taking over the Bosphorus Bridge and hitting those in their path. Soldiers declared martial law and commandoes stormed the hotel in the seaside resort of Marmaris where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had been staying. They were too late. He was being evacuated to Istanbul. The phone call from his plane urging people on to the street was the decisive moment in defeating the coup attempt. But 240 people died resisting a takeover that will forever endure in the consciousness of this country. \"It was a night of horror - but we weren't scared for our lives, we were scared for our nation,\" says Ravza Kavakci Kan, an MP with the governing AK Party, as we tour the destruction in parliament. \"But this was the day we would defend our democracy. It brought the Turkish people together in solidarity. It was our liberation war.\" In some ways, the attempted coup has united a deeply polarised country. Four military interventions since 1960 had disrupted a still young democracy. But this time, the people resisted it - and paid a bloody price. Recep Tayyip Erdogan divides the electorate - but the message on 15 July was that Turks would choose their political future at the ballot box rather than by military takeover. There are signs that the political chasms have narrowed: for the first time, opposition leaders attended a millions-strong rally for democracy in Istanbul led by Mr Erdogan. But \"political unity\" only goes so far. The pro-Kurdish HDP party is still excluded, blamed by the government for being too close to the PKK Kurdish militants who continue to launch armed attacks. The HDP denies any link. An unprecedented purge is the other result of the past month. More than 23,000 people have been detained or arrested and 82,000 dismissed or suspended. They are accused of backing the coup attempt or the alleged mastermind: the cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in self-imposed exile in the US and whose large network of followers are said to have infiltrated Turkish institutions over many decades. The cleric, once a close ally of President Erdogan, denies any involvement. \"This is not a purge,\" says Ms Kavakci Kan. \"We are very transparent. For the people who are being detained and investigated, there is proof. Whoever is not a part of this will go free.\" Western governments condemned the coup attempt but have also criticised the wave of detentions. That has riled many here who perceive it as a lack of solidarity. Angela Merkel visited Turkey frequently during the migrant crisis but no Western leader has come in the past month to express support for a Nato member and EU candidate country. \"We are really disappointed,\" says Ms Kavakci Kan. \"Show some compassion to those who stood in front of the tanks. Western governments are more concerned about the coup-plotters, those cowards, than they are for the Turkish people.\" Among the institutions closed down since the coup are all military schools as the government pursues its aim of \"cleansing\" the armed forces. At Sincan prison near Ankara, 142 students are being held. Beside the barbed-wire fences and watchtowers, several of their families tell me they are being wrongly accused. On 15 July, they were transferred to Ankara for parachute training, the families say. The government suspects they were being moved to a base to take part in the coup. \"My brother was being trained to serve this country - he would die for it,\" says the sister of one, who wants to remain anonymous. \"It's impossible he's a traitor. We don't accept these allegations. We're all against the coup. But the innocent ones must be released.\" Another girl breaks down as she comforts her brother's young baby. \"His daughter was one year old  four days ago and she needs him here,\" she says. \"Never have we been related to the Feto [Fethullah Gulen] terrorist organisation. We curse them.\" It is not just the attempted takeover for which the \"Gulenists\" are blamed. Several damaging incidents are now being pinned on them, including the nationwide Gezi Park protests in 2013 and the shooting down of a Russian jet in Turkey last November that soured relations with Moscow - even though the prime minister and president appeared to take responsibility for it at the time. The fear is that the Gulen label is being freely applied to a range of opponents and that in the \"new Turkey\" you are either seen as a staunch government supporter and anti-coup activist or a potential Gulen sympathiser. A well-known singer had her concerts cancelled after she refused to perform at the democracy meeting in Istanbul. And the Actors' Union has warned that a \"witch hunt is influencing intellectuals, journalists, artists, writers and actors who have nothing to do with Feto\". Arda Aydin is one of six actors who have been suspended, pending investigation. Others were laid off for \"poor performance\". \"We've probably been suspended because we opposed the government in the past few years - but it's laughable to say we are Gulenist,\" he says. \"Those targeting us are trying to turn down our voices. They think we'll be scared - but the opposition can never be silenced.\" For over three weeks after the coup attempt, thousands gathered every night in the main cities on a \"democracy watch\", listening to political speeches and waving flags. Many came for their president - who now has the highest popularity ratings since taking office - but others came for their country. There has been an outpouring of nationalism since 15 July. The Turkey that has emerged is defiant and proud of standing up for democracy. But fear and division do still exist.

{"article": "April has given us a clutch of anniversaries and the usual mix of anxieties dressed as news. South Africa turned 19, Zimbabwe turned 33 and we wondered what would become of Mali as it was decided a UN peacekeeping force would take over from the French, while the French themselves had an embassy bombed in Libya and Somalia's al-Shabab showed signs of a pulse still beating in its violent heart. African athletes won a couple of international marathons and Kenya's new cabinet had a woman defence minister for the first time and more was said by financial analysts about the rapid economic growth on the continent. You would think, then, as an Africa watcher that the usual mix of information filled the newspapers and cyberspace with the political and financial. But a quick glimpse of the press in Uganda showed us that the month of April was also about \"integrity and ethics\" because Simon Lokodo, Uganda's ethics and integrity minister, was railing against the miniskirt in his preparation of a proposed anti-pornography bill. \"Any attire which exposes intimate parts of the human body, especially areas that are of erotic function, is outlawed. Anything above the knee is outlawed. If a woman wears a miniskirt, we will arrest her,\" pronounced the minister in a confusing bid to preserve the nation's modesty. In truth Mr Lokodo has joined a long list of men - for it is usually men - who have taken offence at what women wear throughout independent Africa for decades. Hastings Kamuzu Banda's Malawi banned the same skirt and frowned at women wearing trousers back in the days when dictatorship was hip and fashionable - Uganda's Idi Amin did not much like that particular skirt either. An explosion of cultural colonialism in the form of hip-hop, pop, belly dancing, pole dancing, satellite television - which beams the dramas of other lives into African homes and the fashions of a recklessly cool world youth into African minds - has had the likes of Mr Lokodo scrambling to hold back the waves of moral corruption he imagines are coming his way. Mr Lokodo's Anti-Pornography Bill has not defined \"pornography\" as we may or may not encounter it on the streets of Kampala, nor does it tell us what his ministry intends to do about the very real pornography available at the touch of a cursor on the World Wide Web of which Uganda is a part. Yet to be fair to the minister of ethics and integrity, a far more insidious vice than women's summer wear has been arriving in African cities, and by chance, in 2012, Kampala police arrested a foreigner who had been recording pictures of himself engaging in sexual acts with Ugandan children. No law existed to give him more than the two years in prison or a 6m Ugandan shilling ($2,318, Â£1492) fine on offer under the Computer Misuse Act, and the criminal simply paid the fine and was released - only to be hauled back to jail because of the public outcry which ensued. He is to now face a new trial, including charges of indecent exposure. The huge net of globalisation that has given us Chinese architecture and mobile phone companies of every persuasion that have opened up our capitals, has not been discriminating about who or what comes in to shred our traditional values and corrupt our young. Some argue pornography leads to increased sexual violence - although others say it does not. The Anti-Pornography Bill up for discussion in Uganda says there has been \"an increase in pornographic material in the Ugandan mass media and an increase in nude dancing in the entertainment worldâ€¦ One of the dangers pornography poses is that it fuels sexual crimes against womenâ€¦\" and the bill seeks to slap a 10m shilling fine and/or 10 years in jail on anyone who engages in pornography, dirty dancing and minimalist attire. Yet while Minister Lokodo's intentions may have been to protect Ugandans from the morally degenerate, he has taken his very broad assegai (spear) to personal freedoms and ignited the long-running debate about where sexual crimes begin - with the criminals or with victims because of what they are wearing? Women, he alleged, should not wear provocative clothing and men, he says, are not usually the \"object of attraction and can go shirtless\" on the beach. This line of argument gets us all nowhere very fast and fails to acknowledge that people who rape or are driven to drooling uncontrollably at the sight of a female thigh with which they are not well acquainted are provoked only by the demons in their own heads and pander to their basest natures. As a former Catholic priest, Minister Lokodo would know a thing or two about demons, and know too that the best place to get rid of them is through the church, not via government statutes. Should prayer fail, there will always be a Ugandan jail. And the miniskirt has very little to do with it.

{"article": "It will be useful preparation for the chilly atmosphere Poland's politicians seem to expect around the table when next year's Brexit negotiations bring together the UK and the 27 countries that will remain in the EU after it leaves. Modern Poland is a place of sharply polarised politics in which a broad coalition of liberal opposition parties fear their country is in the grip of a government so deeply conservative that it is exerting a kind of reactionary grip on political life. \"People who support one side really don't speak to people who support the other,\" one old friend told me in Warsaw. \"I don't even remember that in the communist days.\" One thing that does more or less seem to unite Poland's fractious political class, though, is a profound belief in the value of the EU. In the UK, Brussels may be seen as a source of unwanted migration and pettifogging over-regulation, but in a country which has emerged from the suffocating grip of Soviet communism within the last 30 years, EU membership is seen as a guarantee of a democratic future and a seat at the high table of European politics. More on this story: Poland, of course, has also enjoyed huge financial benefits from its membership and that has no doubt helped shape that positive perception. But there is a genuine readiness among Polish politicians to accept that it is worth swallowing the minor irritations of membership to preserve the overall benefits. For that reason politicians here are generally adamant that the UK cannot have a bespoke deal with the EU in which it might negotiate membership of the single market without signing up to the free movement of EU labour. Former Europe Minister Rafal Trzaskowski said he believed the so-called four freedoms of the single market (labour, capital, goods and services) had to be accepted or rejected as a package. It's not just about negotiating with Britain, he explains, but about making sure that Brexit doesn't trigger a wider unravelling of the Union. \"Trying to unpick the freedoms, and saying 'OK I like financial freedom of movement, but I don't like free movement of workers' - I mean, that would actually allow other states to do exactly the same,\" he argues. That kind of argument, which you hear from other politicians in Warsaw too, places Poland in the middle of what is starting to feel like a concerted European push to warn Britain that it won't have access to the single market unless it allows EU migration. In all the countries that joined the EU after emerging from the shadows of Soviet communism there is a deeper and more complex dimension to the argument about free movement of labour, which is perhaps difficult for British voters and politicians to grasp. Anyone who's over 50 in Poland - and all of their children - will remember the petty humiliations of Soviet occupation and, in particular, the enormous difficulties of arranging foreign travel even with the communist bloc. For all those people the right to travel to countries like Britain which came with EU accession was a sign that their country and its people were now accepted at the high table of European politics. \"I myself remember, after we joined, and for the first time at an airport, I could join the EU citizens aisle, and just go without much control - without a stamp - and cross the border,\"  said writer and journalist Julia Szyndzielorz. \"I had tears in my eyes, because that was such a touching moment. And to be deprived of that will be very, very hurtful.\" So politicians in Poland may well shape their approach to Brexit negotiations in part as a response to a sense that a long-dreamed-of freedom of movement is being suddenly curtailed. Seen from here, it's not entirely about aspiring to get a job on a building site in Northampton, it's about equality too. Julia Libera and her husband came home to Warsaw from London after the Brexit vote, a little shocked to find that some at least of their neighbours and colleagues had decided that the Polish presence in the UK was more of a problem than an asset. They would like one day to return but they won't know if that's possible until the outcome is known of the UK's Brexit negotiations with the 27 countries which are to remain in the EU. \"When you're young and you're thinking of starting a family you need a certain degree of stability and in the UK now you don't have that,\" says Julia. \"So, yes, I think it's possible that I won't be allowed back to work in the UK and that makes me sad and angry.\" Poland's politicians are preparing to play their part in Brexit negotiations, determined to protect the interests of those Poles who already live in the UK and the prospects for those who might aspire to living and working there in the future. As things stand it's hard to see how those aspirations can be squared with the UK's ambition of taking back control of its own borders and somehow controlling the inward movement of people from the EU and beyond. The atmosphere around that negotiating table might become very chilly indeed.", "question": "There is a warning of winter - to - come on the edge of the October @placeholder sweeping through the elegant parks and handsome squares of Warsaw .

Fellow Tories Alok Sharma and Rob Wilson held off opposition challenges in Reading West and Reading East. The only seat not to go blue was in Slough, where Fiona Mactaggart increased her majority for Labour. Despite a bruising night for her party nationally, Mrs Mactaggart admitted the campaign locally had felt \"extremely positive\". \"The people of Britain have grown up realising that after the recession, any party in government had to take on tough decisions,\" she said. \"I don't think that makes it easy for the opposition.\" Labour would have fancied their chances of taking at least one of the two seats in Reading from the Conservatives, but their anticipated challenge failed to materialise. Alok Sharma slightly increased his majority in Reading West to 6,650 while Rob Wilson weathered a slight fall in his Reading East advantage as the Liberal Democrat vote fell by 20%. Rob Wilson said \"Britain had chosen\" to continue with the long-term economic plan of the Conservatives. He said: \"Tomorrow we start the hard work of finishing that job, but today I'm off for a bacon sandwich and a scotch whiskey.\" He added that a third Thames bridge for Reading would be one of his priorities in the next parliament. Re-elected Maidenhead MP Theresa May said in her victory speech she was \"honoured\" to be voted back in. But speaking on BBC Radio Berkshire she avoided answering the question of whether she wanted to remain Home Secretary: \"I've always taken a very simple view in politics that actually you wait to be asked and whatever job you're asked to do you just get on and do it to the best of your ability.\" In nearby Windsor, Adam Afriyie was equally buoyant. \"I feel incredibly energised and I'm really just overwhelmed by the level of support,\" he said. \"I feel like I'm ready to get on and protect our constituency in the wider national picture.\" The smiles were equally as broad for Richard Benyon in Newbury as he more than doubled his 12,248 majority from 2010 to more than 26,000.

{"article": "The debate then centred upon the question of whether the Scottish Parliament, once established, could be protected against the potential depredations of a future UK administration which might be inimical to devolved power. Could it be saved from abolition? I freely confess that I always believed that debate was futile. Westminster remains sovereign. One Parliament cannot bind its successors. So \"entrenchment\" was never, seriously, a runner, at least not in statutory terms. In practice, the Conventioneers ended up suggesting that there be a declaration from political leaders that they wouldn't scrap the Scottish Parliament. Even this device, as I recall, was quietly forgotten. Which brings us to the Sewel Convention. Whereby it is agreed that Westminster will not customarily legislate or intervene in issues which are the devolved domain of Holyrood. Today's Supreme Court judgment, entirely understandably, goes into a myriad of details about the Brexit process. The process, note, not whether Britain should leave the EU. However, the summary findings are admirably clear. The UK Government cannot rely solely upon Crown prerogative to trigger Brexit.  They need endorsement from Westminster, both Commons and Lords. Further, there is no legal requirement to consult devolved legislatures, such as Holyrood. That finding was unanimous, by contrast with the initial ruling on Westminster's role which was carried by eight votes to three. Thirdly, anent Holyrood's wider role, as expressed through the Sewel Convention (named after Lord Sewel, the former UK Minister who first evinced it). The Supreme Court confirmed that the Sewel Convention is just that: a convention. It is not justiciable. It is not a law which can be interpreted or applied by diktat of a court. But hang on. Was it not the case that the Sewel Convention was placed in statute? In the 2016 Act which followed the 2014 independence referendum and the subsequent Smith Commission? Yes but, according to their lordships, that merely formalised recognition of the Convention. It did not give it added legal force. The relevant section of the 2016 Act says: \"It is recognised that the Parliament of the United Kingdom will not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.\" Again according to their lordships, the clues are there. In the terminology \"it is recognised\" and \"normally\". That signals it is a convention, a principle to be pursued where possible. Not legally compulsory. To be fair, this issue was debated at the time of the passage of the 2016 Act. Assurances were sought and, with caveats, given. The status of the new Sewel - now generally known as a Legislative Consent Motion or LCM - was questioned and challenged. But political debate, much more concerned with the proposed new tax powers for the Scottish Parliament, fairly quickly trundled on to the next caravanserai, there to quench the collective constitutional thirst of Scotland. Now the issue is back in the environs of today's ruling. And it has, again entirely understandably, prompted a range of responses, generally following the fault line of Scottish politics: independence versus the Union. Supporters of the Union accuse Nicola Sturgeon of seeking to prolong an argument about process in order to foster her standing demand for independence. In return, Ms Sturgeon argues that today's ruling on Sewel brings welcome clarity. It is now becoming evident, she argues, that the people of Scotland cannot expect redress from the UK political system. The time is \"looming\", she says, when the choice may once again be placed before the voters in Scotland. In short, indyref2.  Remember my interview a week ago in which she agreed that such a development was now all but inevitable. But we are not there yet. There are many elements to this remarkable debate yet, both over Brexit and its potential implications for Scotland. Firstly, what will the Commons do?  The Conservatives will vote en masse for the rapid triggering of Article 50. They will do so either on the basis of firm belief or on the subsidiary count that it was their party which instigated the referendum and therefore they should facilitate the outcome. Labour seems divided - partly over tactics, partly over support or otherwise for the EU. They are torn between a sense of internationalism and a fear that they will shed yet more public support if they go against the proletarian areas of England which voted Leave. However, the leadership signals there will be a whipped vote for Article 50 and it is to be expected that most will fall in line. Some in Labour, indeed, have long distrusted the EU as a \"bosses' club\". The Liberal Democrats remain firmly against Brexit - and want a further referendum on the outcome of talks. And the SNP? They will not vote for Article 50, given that they take their mandate from the Scottish people, who voted Remain by a majority. But they will also table up to 50 amendments - if they can and if the Speaker permits - presumably seeking to mitigate Brexit as a fall-back. Or to prolong debate. Or both. Meanwhile the Scottish Government will pursue their case for a distinctive Scottish deal in discussions with the UK Government. To be clear, David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, made plain that he was very far from closing his mind to such discussions.  He would respect the role of the devolved legislatures and administrations, whatever the court said about their standing in statute. But I do not detect any evident expectation - either at Westminster or Holyrood - that these talks will lead anywhere substantive. UK ministers will want to be getting on with the process of securing a UK deal with the EU. Scottish ministers will continue to discuss, cajole and persuade. But there is minimal talk of progress. Ms Sturgeon also says that there will be a vote at Holyrood on the fitness or otherwise of Article 50. It may not prove possible for that to be a formal LCM: that will depend upon the Presiding Officer's ruling once the planned paving Bill at Westminster is published and scrutinised. But the PO's office rightly note that there are other avenues for expressing opinion, such as a generic debate. Will that make much difference? Almost certainly not. UK ministers - including the prime minister - are adamant that they will take account of a diverse range of opinions, including those of MSPs and the Scottish Government. However, today's Supreme Court ruling delineates precisely where formal, statutory power lies on the issue of reshaping Britain's relationship with the EU. Europe, as an issue, is reserved to Westminster along with foreign affairs more generally. It falls to the UK Parliament to implement the expressed popular will of the UK as a whole. Quite right, say supporters of the Union, advising Ms Sturgeon to fall into step. Which brings us back to the fundamental issue in Scottish politics. Ms Sturgeon does not accept a UK mandate but rather seeks the power to implement an independent Scottish mandate. Two competing options, then.

This month, the US firm cut its profit outlook, citing a slower-than-expected comeback in China. The move means any setbacks in China will have less impact on the US stock. Yum had come under mounting pressure from investors to split the units. The announcement came just days after the firm had named activist investor Keith Meister to its board. Mr Meister is the founder and managing partner of hedge fund Corvex Management which has a stake in Yum and had suggested the plans to split off the China unit. The firm said the spin-off will be complete by 2016. Yum Brands has suffered repeated setback in its China business. The firm blamed a stronger US currency against the yuan for its poor results. But it is also still recovering from a food scandal last year. Revenue at the KFC restaurants in China suffered in July last year after a television report linked the brand to supplier Shanghai Husi Food, which was accused of selling meat that was out of date. Since then, the firm has been trying to win back customers. In the latest quarter, Yum Brands reported that sales in China rose just 2%. But the company is also suffering from the slowing overall economic growth in the country, as well as growing competition from local food companies. Yet the company on Tuesday said it believes the China unit could grow from its current 6,900 restaurants to more than 20,000 restaurants in the future. The China business, which will be headquartered in Shanghai, had brought in $6.9bn (Â£4.8bn) in revenue last year. At its 1987 debut near Beijing's Tiananmen Square, Yum's KFC was a novelty with a menu that included porridge and other local favourites. The company said that the remaining Yum Brands business outside of China will concentrate on becoming more of a franchisor, with the goal of having at least 95% of its restaurants owned and operated by franchisees by the end of 2017. Yum China will be Yum Brands' biggest franchisee and will operate under a franchise agreement.

But globally, investment rose 10.9%. There were 1,436 fintech deals globally, attracting $17.4bn in investment, Innovate Finance says, with China outpacing the US for the first time. China invested $7.7bn while the US invested $6.2bn. Venture capitalists typically invest in higher-risk, early-stage companies, but in the UK uncertainty around the Brexit decision seems to have blunted their appetite for risk. Around 35 Innovate Finance members have reported a withdrawal or reduction in capital funding since the referendum, says Mr Wintermeyer. \"Investors don't like uncertainty,\" he said. While London could boast \"one of the best fintech investment scenes in the world\", thanks to government support and \"enlightened regulators\", the capital could be \"challenged as a global financial centre\" if tech talent was forced to move abroad, he said.

Tim Levene, managing partner at Augmentum Capital, a Â£40m fund investing in fintech start-ups such as Nutmeg, Zopa and Seedrs, said: \"We tried to raise Â£100m for a new European fintech fund last year, but two major institutions pulled out two weeks after the Brexit vote - they don't like the uncertainty. \"Most fund managers want to know what the future holds.\" Mr Levene warns that worse is yet to come, given than \"much of the capital currently being invested was raised before Brexit\". \"There's no question that the US funds who've traditionally invested in European start-ups are pulling in their horns,\" he told the BBC. \"The next two or three years will be challenging.\" The biggest fintech deal of 2016 involving a UK company was the $5.5bn merger of financial information provider Markit with US-based IHS.

{"article": "It showed the Dutch have nearly an hour more in bed every night than people in Singapore or Japan. The study, published in Science Advances, also found women routinely get more sleep than men, with middle-aged men getting the least of all. The researchers say the findings could be used to deal with the \"global sleep crisis\". The team at the University of Michigan released the Entrain app in 2014 to help people overcome jetlag. But users could choose to share data on their sleeping habits with the research group. 'Arrogance' of ignoring need for sleep Find out what is happening in your body right now The study found people in Japan and Singapore had an average of seven hours and 24 minutes sleep while the people in the Netherlands had eight hours and 12 minutes. People in the UK averaged just under eight hours - a smidgen less than the French. And it was a country's average bedtime that had the biggest impact on the time spent between the sheets. The later a country stays up into the night, the less sleep it gets. But what time a country wakes up seems to have little effect on sleep duration. Prof Daniel Forger, one of the researchers, said there was a conflict between our desire to stay up late and our bodies urging us to get up in the morning. He told the BBC News website: \"Society is pushing us to stay up late, our [body] clocks are trying to get us up earlier and in the middle the amount of sleep is being sacrificed; that's what we think is going on in global sleep crisis. \"If you look at countries that are really getting less sleep then I'd spend less time worrying about alarm clocks and more about what people are doing at night - are they having big dinners at 22:00 or expected to go back to the office?\" The study also showed women had about 30 minutes more per night in bed than men, particularly between the ages of 30 and 60. And that people who spend the most time in natural sunlight tended to go to bed earlier. A strong effect of age on sleep was also detected. A wide range of sleep and wake-up times was found in young people but \"that really narrows in old age,\" said Prof Forger. Dr Akhilesh Reddy, from the University of Cambridge, told the BBC: \"I think it's interesting; there's been a trend for these studies using data from twitter and apps and finding interesting correlations across the world we've never been able to do by putting people in sleep lab. \"It highlights that although our body clocks are programming us to do certain things, we can't as we're ruled by social circumstances. \"We won't know the long-term consequences of this for many years.\" Disrupted sleep in shift workers has been linked to a range of health problems, including type 2 diabetes.

Hours before the rallies, the leader of the ruling centre-right Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, branded the current opposition as \"anti-state\". He went on to threaten to \"bring order\" to opposition activity. Mr Kaczynski, widely seen as the power behind Poland's government, did not specify what he had in mind during a radio interview. Addressing a pro-government rally later, he ridiculed opponents for resisting plans to change a system which he said had harmed the majority of Poles. However, the Committee for the Defence of Democracy (KOD) commemorated the anniversary of martial law with anti-government marches across the country, and a large crowd snaked through the centre of Warsaw. Protesters highlighted government policies on women's rights as well as reforms to education and the top legislative court. Many members of Poland's current governing Law and Justice (PiS) party were part of the opposition Solidarity movement, which the communist regime set out to crush under martial law. Thirty-five years on, Poland's opposition leaders say PiS, and its head Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are behaving as badly as the communists, restricting democratic freedoms and hobbling the Constitutional Tribunal so it is unable to veto the government's programme. Mr Kaczynski says the opposition refuses to accept PiS's victory in last year's elections and its continuing popularity, branding the accusations \"absurd\". Simple comparisons to the communists are overblown, of course, but Mr Kaczynski continues to give more liberal-minded Poles cause for concern, branding them \"anti-state\" and warning that the government plans to introduce measures to bring \"order\" to the opposition's activities. Gen Wojciech Jaruzelski argued that he had imposed martial law on 13 December 1981 to deter a Soviet invasion. But in the subsequent crackdown, thousands of members of the pro-democracy Solidarity movement were arrested and as many as 100 people died. Martial law was lifted two years later and Gen Jaruzelski eventually stood down in 1990. He died in 2014.

Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, 22, and Mohammed Abdul Kadir, 24, were said to have developed \"a hatred\" of Mr Uddin, Manchester Crown Court heard. Mr Syeedy, of Ramsay Street, Rochdale, denies murder with another. The jury was told Mr Kadir fled abroad in the days that followed Mr Uddin's death, on 18 February. The prosecution claims the Bangladeshi national was targeted after he left a mosque where he usually prayed, ate a meal at a friend's house and then walked home. Mr Syeedy and Mr Kadir were said to have taken offence after discovering he practised Ruqya healing, which involves the use of amulets. It is alleged the pair mounted surveillance of Mr Uddin, who was described as \"quiet, dignified and well-respected\", before he was killed in an attack, thought to have involved a hammer. Opening the trial, prosecutor Paul Greaney QC said: \"Who hated a decent man like Jalal Uddin with such virulence? \"The answer to that important question is to be found in the twisted ideology of Isis, sometimes known as Islamic State. \"Jalal Uddin was a practitioner of a form of Islamic healing called Ruqya. \"Isis regards this practice as black magic and adheres to the view that those who engage in it deserve severe punishment, even death. \"Mohammed Hussain Syeedy, the defendant, and an associate of his named Mohammed Abdul Kadir, were supporters of Isis and so they subscribed to the view that those who practised Ruqya deserved such punishment.\" Mr Greaney said Mr Syeedy will claim he does not support Isis or violent extremism of any kind. He told the jury: \"Your task will be to determine whether that defence may be true. \"Our submission is that once you have heard all of the evidence, you will be sure that it is not true.\" He said it was the prosecution's case that Mr Syeedy drove Mr Kadir to the gates of the park, knowing full well Mr Kadir intended to attack Mr Uddin. Mr Kadir was said to have landed \"repeated forceful blows\", including to his mouth and teeth, which left the victim with a skull fracture. He then dashed to the exit on the other side of the park, where he was picked up by Mr Syeedy, the court heard. Two young girls discovered the unconscious Mr Uddin at about 20:45 GMT.

{"article": "But an apparent fall from grace has seen her lift the lid on the secretive politics of one of Central Asia's most authoritarian states. Viewed until recently as a potential successor to her father, the publicity savvy Ms Karimova has been using the micro blogging site Twitter to attack key figures and institutions of the Uzbek regime. Her unprecedented actions come in response to moves apparently aimed at curbing her influence. Apart from her artistic ventures, which have included a pop video with French actor Gerard Depardieu, Ms Karimova has built a reputation as a powerful businesswoman. She has been closely associated with several TV and radio channels which routinely portray her as a philanthropist and patron of the arts. Through her Fund Forum organisation Ms Karimova has organised a steady stream of public events, from charity mass weddings to the annual StyleUz art festival. But her pervasive media presence has taken a sudden nosedive. Last month a handful of TV and radio channels close to Ms Karimova stopped broadcasting. One media group was put under investigation on suspicion of financial wrongdoing. The media blackout also hit Ms Karimova's showpiece event - the annual StyleUz festival - usually graced by international stars; both Jose Carreras and Sting have performed in the past. But in contrast to the routine headline coverage of past years, state media gave the 2013 event the cold shoulder. On top of that, the singer Lara Fabian pulled out after being criticised for agreeing to perform in a country known for human rights abuses. The Fund Forum organisation running the event, and which Ms Karimova chairs, has since come under pressure from financial regulators. In response Ms Karimova has lashed out on Twitter, an unprecedented move in the secretive country where the media are tightly controlled. In a tweet from 13 November she claimed that men with assault rifles had ransacked the youth studio of one of the closed TV stations. \"People were beaten up,\" she wrote, adding that young people had been intimidated with fabricated cases of sabotage and anti-government sentiments. But her most astonishing comments came when she accused the country's powerful security chief, Rustam Inoyatov, of masterminding the hostility against her and of aiming for the country's top post. Responding to a tweet asking her if Rustam Inoyatov would seek the presidency, she tweeted: \"He will! He is already fighting for it!\" She also accused Mr Inoyatov of threatening her and stopping her from running for president. \"This is what he said,\" she wrote. \"We will not touch you if you lie low.\" In other tweets Ms Karimova alleged that the security service is using threats, beatings and forced confessions, even against its own officers. \"They have already beaten up staff members to force them to confess to actions they did not commit,\" she wrote on 4 November, giving details of the beating of one officer who she claimed had his ribs broken. She also wrote that officers had been targeted for blowing the whistle on illegal activities in the security apparatus such as drinking at work, racketeering and smuggling alcohol and cigarettes. Such allegations chime with accusations by human rights bodies who say torture and mistreatment are systematic in Uzbekistan's justice system, something regime figures routinely deny. Observers say the public outpourings have brought into the open an intensifying rivalry within the Uzbek elite with the question of who will replace 75-year-old President Karimov looming large. Ms Karimova has long been seen as a leading contender, but a series of problems at home and abroad have undermined her. Last year her name became embroiled with a wide-ranging money-laundering and bribery investigation in Sweden and Switzerland after several of her close associates became suspects. This year the probe came closer to home with reports that her properties in France had been searched as part of the investigations. In September her troubles became personal when her younger sister, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva revealed in comments to the BBC that the siblings had not spoken for years and the family was deeply divided. Miss Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva also gave short shrift to her sister's chances of becoming president. In an apparent response Ms Karimova accused her sister and mother of engaging in sorcery. More broadly she has blamed the negative headlines on enemies trying to blacken her name. But she is now facing much more serious threats. Ms Karimova has alleged that there were attempts to shut down her Fund Forum organisation and that people were collecting negative facts against her. Given her place in a regime notorious for choking off civil society organisations, her defence of NGOs and free speech seems startling. \"What kind of NGO's can operate in the country then? Maybe only docile and silent ones can?\" she tweeted on 7 November. Ms Karimova also wrote there had been attempts to poison her with mercury and that she was still receiving medical treatment. The pressure has been telling. Ms Karimova has distanced herself from any presidential ambitions, saying she was not interested in \"that hellish post\". More recently she tweeted, \"they want me to shut up already and leave\".

The visitors took a shock first-half lead when Brede Hangeland headed in. The Gunners equalised just before the break when Laurent Koscielny nodded home from Alexis Sanchez's free-kick. Despite kicking off their Premier League challenge with a win, it was an inauspicious start having barely made Palace keeper Julian Speroni work for his wage. Media playback is not supported on this device Apart from the two goals, the only other time the Palace stopper was called to save his team was when he pushed away Jack Wilshere's drive in the first half. Credit for keeping Arsenal at bay should be given to Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen. The 47-year-old, originally from down the road in Croydon, was thrust into the hot-seat on Thursday following the shock departure of Tony Pulis. So having had less than 48 hours to plan Palace's assault on their London rivals, Millen's team did brilliantly to restrict the Gunners for so long. But their good work came undone in three minutes at the death, when first they were reduced to 10 men when Puncheon went in late on Nacho Monreal, before Ramsey grabbed the winner. The Wales midfielder was quickest to the loose ball after Mathieu Debuchy's snap-shot had been saved. Wenger might point to the fact he did not have his full squad available for the opening match as a reason for the below-par display - only five of the many who spent their summer in Brazil started today. One of those absent was Germany's World Cup winning defender Per Mertesacker, who might have made a better attempt of preventing Hangeland from scoring. The Norway player, who had not scored in the previous three league season for Fulham, was inexplicably left by Sanchez to roam to the near post to meet Puncheon's corner. Media playback is not supported on this device However, just before half-time, the hero at the other end appeared to lose his bearings as Koscielny sneaked clear to connect with Sanchez's lofted free-kick. It was the only major lapse of concentration from the former Fulham player, who could prove to be a key signing for the Eagles, while Sanchez, who cost Arsenal considerably more, also impressed on his league debut. The Chile international played the full 90 minutes, but it was only when rested France striker Olivier Giroud was introduced in the second half that the Gunners looked like a team who would break down Palace for a second time. And in the closing seconds, the club's top scorer last season proved how key he is to the attack when he headed the ball across goal for Debuchy, whose shot was saved, only for team-mate Ramsey to tuck in. Media playback is not supported on this device Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: \"They made it very difficult, they defended very well and took their first opportunity. After that they made it very tight, they were physically very strong and we needed to keep going.

{"article": "Mr Johnson, the Mayor of London, announced on Sunday that he would be backing the campaign for Britain to leave the EU. His intervention in the debate - made, as he termed it, with \"deafening eclat\" - was even said to have helped cause the pound to slide on the international money markets as traders thought it made the possibility of a so-called Brexit more likely. He has arguably the highest profile of any of the governing Conservative Party except the Prime Minister David Cameron, but those outside the UK may be wondering: who is he, and is that actually his hair? Read on. Profile: Boris Johnson How could 'zip wire prat' become prime minister? Read more about the UK's referendum on the EU Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, to give him his full name, was born in New York and is descended from Turkish, French and German stock. He describes himself as a \"one-man melting pot\". He first made a name for himself in journalism, including a stint as Brussels correspondent for the right-wing Daily Telegraph newspaper and editor of The Spectator magazine. His humorous persona led him to become a fixture on various television programmes, including the satirical BBC panel show Have I Got News For You. He still has a lucrative and entertaining column in the Daily Telegraph, in which august forum he explained the reasons for his decision on the EU. As a politician, he has been a Conservative member of parliament for two constituencies, Henley from 2001 to 2008 and then Uxbridge and South Ruislip from 2015. Lest you think he was putting his feet up between parliamentary mandates, he is also currently serving the second of two terms as mayor of London, no mean feat in a city where the centre-left Labour Party has dominated in recent decades. That's indicative of the position Mr Johnson has carved out for himself as one of the most charismatic politicians in the UK who has wide appeal beyond Conservative heartlands - polling has suggested that his stance on the EU referendum may sway some undecided voters. Just look what happens when you type his name into Google.co.uk. Not quite. He has previously courted controversy for his remarks about (among others) the populations of Liverpool, Portsmouth and Papua New Guinea, not to mention run-ins with his own party leadership and TV chef Jamie Oliver. Last October he accidentally flattened a 10-year-old schoolboy at what was meant to be a friendly game of photo-op rugby in Japan. But none of this seems to have affected his standing among the party faithful or the public at large. Even getting stuck on a zip-wire during the London Olympics in 2012, a sure-fire route to derision for any other politician, only enhanced his eccentric image. Mr Johnson finally ended months of speculation about which side of the EU debate he would back in an immaculately impromptu media scrum outside his home in North London, having reportedly informed the prime minister of his decision earlier the same day. He said that he had come to his decision as a result of deeply held convictions and \"after a huge amount of heartache\". His father Stanley, a former Conservative member of the European parliament, said that his son had performed a noble and potentially \"career-ending move\", ruining any chance of serving in Mr Cameron's cabinet. But Mr Cameron has already said he won't run for another mandate when his current one ends in 2020. Some observers of British politics point out that even if the UK votes to remain in the EU, positioning himself in the \"Out\" camp won't do Mr Johnson any harm with grassroots Conservatives, many of who are Eurosceptic and will have the final say in choosing a new leader. In this, some suggest, he is implementing his long-standing policy on cake: \"My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.\" No, that's Donald Trump. Also a pioneer of unorthodox political hair, but they don't get on. When Mr Trump commented that parts of London are \"so radicalised the police are afraid for their lives\", Mr Johnson retorted: \"The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.\" No, I've confused you now by mentioning Donald Trump.

{"article": "Having spent 12 years flying around the ringed planet and its moons at a relatively safe distance, the probe is now about to undertake a series of daredevil manoeuvres. These will see the satellite repeatedly dive extremely close to - and through - the rings over the next nine months. The manoeuvres will culminate in Cassini dumping itself in the atmosphere of the giant planet. This destructive ending is necessary because the spacecraft is running low on fuel. Nasa (US space agency), which leads the Cassini mission, needs to make sure that an out-of-control probe cannot at some future date crash into any of Saturn’s moons - in particular, Enceladus and Titan. There is a chance these moons harbour life, and however remote the possibility - a colliding satellite could introduce contamination from Earth. This must not be allowed to happen. But in the lead up to its safe disposal - set for 15 September next year - Cassini should gather some remarkable science. Starting on Wednesday, Cassini will repeatedly climb high above Saturn's north pole before then plunging to a point just outside the F ring (the outer boundary of the main ring system). The probe will do 20 such orbits, even sampling some of the particles and gases associated with the F ring. Starting on 22 April next year, Cassini will then initiate a series of dives that take it in between the inner edge of the rings and the planet’s atmosphere. On occasion, it could pass less than 2,000km above Saturn’s cloud tops. As well as returning some spectacular imagery of the rings and  moonlets previously seen only from a large distance, these upcoming manoeuvres are designed to permit close-up investigation of Saturn’s interior. “One of the big outstanding questions at Saturn, for example, is: we don’t know how long a day is. We have a large error. It’s 10.7 hours plus or minus 0.2 hours,” said magnetic field instrument principal investigator, Prof Michele Dougherty. “Come and ask me afterwards but I think what we learn about the internal structure of the planet could be among the great discoveries of mission,” the Imperial College London, UK, scientist told BBC News. Interestingly, many of the unknowns at Saturn are similar to the ones also now being pursued by Nasa’s Juno spacecraft at Jupiter - fascinating mysteries such as whether there is a solid core at the planet's centre. “It’s as if we’re about to do a whole new mission at Saturn - a Juno-type mission at Saturn,” said Prof Dougherty. Cassini is a cooperative venture between Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Italian space agency. The probe launched in 1997 and arrived at Saturn in July 2004. Key discoveries have included the determination that Enceladus is spewing water into space from a sub-surface ocean, and that Titan is a strange Earth-like world where lakes and seas are fed by rivers and rain - except that all the liquid is made up of hydrocarbons such as methane.

{"article": "The new law will effectively turn all 630,000 sq km (243,000 square miles) of the nation's territorial waters into a shark sanctuary. The ban was approved by Agriculture Minister Larry Cartwright in the capital, Nassau, on Tuesday. The archipelago joins Honduras, the Maldives and Palau in outlawing shark fishing. The government also increased shark-fishing fines from $3,000 (??1,900) to $5,000. Sharks are considered at risk due to demand for their fins in Chinese cuisine - some 73 million of the sea predators are killed each year, environmentalists say. In 1993 the Bahamas banned long-line fishing, which limited shark fishing and protected 40 species of sharks inhabiting its waters. But shark fishing was not banned outright, and when a local seafood company announced last year that it planned to export shark meat and fins to Hong Kong, activists called for a new law to be introduced. Environmentalists welcomed the ban. Neil McKinney, president of the Bahamas National Trust, which manages the country's resources, said sharks played an extremely important role in balancing the ecosystem. \"They desperately need protection if we're not going to drive them to extinction,\" AFP news agency quoted him as saying. Tourism is a major industry in the Bahamas, and shark-diving earns it $80m a year in revenue, according to a recent survey. The country's main island, New Providence, is home to Jaws Beach, where one of the Jaws films was shot. Last year, the remains of a boatman who had disappeared off the beach were found in the stomach of a tiger shark caught by an investment banker. The US-based Pew Environment Group said each reef shark brought some $250,000 to the archipelago's economy. Deputy Prime Minister Brent Symonette said he did not think the ban would affect relations with China, which has increased trade with the Bahamas in recent years. \"This is in keeping with the government's commitment to pursue conservation policies and strategies in order to safeguard the marine and terrestrial environment,\" the Associated Press quoted him as saying.", "question": "The Bahamas has banned shark fishing in its waters and prohibited the @placeholder , import and export of shark products .", "option_0": "size", "option_1": "sale", "option_2": "fortunes", "option_3": "region", "option_4": "world", "label": 1}
{"article": "Blaise Compaore, who was deposed recently as Burkina Faso's president, was always a difficult subject to handle for us here in Ghana. As the man who for 27 years was in charge of the country to the north of us, we had to deal with him. The suave, sharp-suited former soldier of few words posed difficulties for our rulers and diplomats in deciding how to categorise him. The problem started with how Mr Compaore came to power in 1987. He was accused of complicity in the killing of his predecessor Thomas Sankara, who had been described as his \"blood brother\". Mr Compaore denied the charges. Back then our leader, Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings was best friends with Thomas Sankara, and the suspicions made it difficult for relations to be warm between the two soldiers. Unlike Mr Sankara and Mr Rawlings, Mr Compaore was not a great talker. He did not rant or rave about anything or anybody, or about what he liked or didn't like. Without making any announcements or speeches, he became close friends with Muammar Gaddafi when the then Libyan leader was the bugbear of the Western world. A lot of Libyan money started going into Burkina Faso. Nowhere near that kind of money came into Ghana even though we were officially friends of Col Gaddafi. The 'heroes' of Burkina Faso's revolution The rise and fall of Blaise Compaore Before very long and without his saying so, it became evident that Mr Compaore had become good friends with France, the US and other Western countries. Again, the evidence of this came with the amount of Western money that was going into Burkina Faso. In the early 1990s, Mr Compaore, our neighbour, always seemed to manage to get the best of both worlds. I remember Captain Valentine Strasser telling me soon after he had overthrown Sierra Leone's President Joseph Momoh in 1992 that his inspiration was Mr Rawlings. Two years later when Yahya Jammeh overthrew Dauda Jawarah to seize power in The Gambia, he also claimed his inspiration was Mr Rawlings. When Charles Taylor would narrate his journey, from being locked up in an American jail to warlord to president of Liberia, he always made mention of his stop in Ghana. None of these people ever mentioned that they had received crucial support from the smooth operator of Burkina Faso in staging their coups or starting their wars. We in Ghana got the bad name and he was alleged to have got the diamonds - charges he denied. Before our very eyes, our smooth Burkinabe operator managed to shed all trace of ever having instigated or supported insurrections and he was transformed into a regional peacemaker. He became the Ecowas (Economic Community of West African States) man to pour oil over troubled waters. In Ivory Coast, Mali or Guinea, he was there; never saying very much publicly but always seeming to be a critical cog in the peace process. In the international arena, Mr Compaore was seen as a reliable man in the fight against al-Qaeda in the Maghreb and the Americans were generous in return. To us, Burkina Faso remained a poor country, though we were beginning to re-examine our attitude to our neighbour. We import a lot of livestock from Burkina Faso; sheep, goats and cattle and we continue to do so in increasingly big numbers. In the past few years it has been a source of deep embarrassment to us that we also import lots of vegetables and fruits, like onions, tomatoes, runner beans, water melon and mangoes from our desert neighbour. We look on with puzzlement as Burkina Faso exports high quality vegetables and potatoes and strawberries to France. We take refuge only in our belief that we have a democracy and Mr Compaore, for all his peace-making and sophisticated outlook, was presiding over a fragile state. When he built an impressive beachfront estate in the central region of our country, some of us wondered if Mr Compaore could possibly have been making retirement plans. Unfortunately he had obviously come to believe he was so much smarter than his neighbours; he had seen off three Ghanaian presidents - Mr Rawlings, John Kufuor and John Atta Mills. So why would he not outlast the incumbent, John Dramani Mahama? But the Burkinabe people had had enough, they intervened dramatically and the smooth operator had to flee to Ivory Coast; dishevelled and ruffled. I wish I could see the photo.

{"article": "Considering the country's size and natural attractions, tourist numbers are low. In 2009, Venezuela received just over 600,000 international visitors, according to World Bank figures, compared to more than two million in neighbouring Colombia. The majority came from Europe or North America, but less than half were on holiday. Venezuela's Institute for National Statistics shows many were visiting family, on business or studying. Venezuela's annual tourism fair gets under way on Thursday and this year the country has teamed up with the UN's World Tourism Organisation to make a special push to improve visitor numbers. We want to \"boost tourism as a means of development and cultural interaction,\" a government statement said. The fair brings together airlines, hotel chains, tour operators and banks looking to invest in tourism. But while tourism overall is still underdeveloped in Venezuela, one niche has done well in recent years. Some foreign tourists have been attracted by Venezuela's political scene since President Hugo Chavez took office in 1999. \"I've been to Cuba five times since 2006 and I really wanted to better understand the connection between the two countries,\" said Nancy Kohn, from Boston, Massachusetts, who was on a bus tour of the capital, Caracas. Sitting next to Ms Kohn was Sue Bergman who works in a clinic in Berkeley, California. \"The reason I chose to come here was because I've been a political activist pretty much my entire life,\" said Ms Bergman. The two women were among a dozen Canadian and American tourists on a \"reality tour\" of Venezuela run by Global Exchange, a US-based organisation. The tour dispensed with the usual holiday fare of museum visits and beaches and instead offered visitors the chance to meet Venezuelan activists and community leaders. \"See for yourself the unprecedented social change that is occurring at this historic time in Venezuela and the region,\" the tour literature said. While Mr Chavez and his policies are an attraction for some, other aspects of his \"Bolivarian revolution\" make life difficult for tourists. Currency controls to stop Venezuelans investing abroad mean the official rate of exchange is poor for foreigners arriving with US dollars. A sandwich and a bottle of water in a cafe in Caracas cost around $25 at the official rate. There has also been criticism of the government's tourism strategy. \"The ministry has changed slogans, image, concepts, markets constantly. There've been a series of changes that basically have just generated distortion and confusion in the international market,\" said Julio Arnaldes, president of the country's tourism council, Conseturismo. The government blames the international media for its inability to attract more visitors. \"There's an international network that says Venezuela is an insecure country, unstable, dangerous and that the revolution and President Chavez keep coming and that revolutionaries eat people,\" Tourism Minister Alejandro Fleming said earlier this year. Venezuela, which has one of the highest murder rates in Latin America,  has certainly struggled with its reputation for violence. But other countries have proved that a bad reputation can be overcome and even turned into an advantage. Colombia, which suffered international headlines about guerrilla conflict and cocaine trafficking, did just that when it came up with its latest tourism campaign. \"The only risk is wanting to stay,\" said the tagline on the advertisements, making an oblique reference to the worries that tourists might have about visiting a country where foreigners had been kidnapped in the past. This daring way to sell Colombia became a story in itself, garnering plenty of extra publicity overseas for its tourism attractions. For Venezuela, heavily dependent on revenues from oil, the main problem could be the lack of incentives to invest in the tourism sector, according to Brazilian advertising executive Bobby Coimbra. \"Since I arrived 20 years ago, I've never seen any government bothered about tourism and no government has ever had a plan to effectively develop the sector and sell Venezuela as a tourist destination,\" said Mr Coimbra, who heads the Caracas office of advertising agency Ogilvy Mather. \"The big problem for Venezuela is that it has a lot of oil, and that means the country doesn't worry about making other plans.\" So while the push is on to attract more visitors, Venezuela's beaches, mountains and Amazon jungle seem set to remain a well-kept secret for some time to come.", "question": "It has the longest Caribbean coastline of any country and the world 's tallest @placeholder , not to mention snow - capped Andean mountains and Amazon rainforest .

The pair were originally charged with attempted murder but the court accepted their guilty pleas to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

{"article": "The announcement may have ended the long-running saga over the future of the business, but it also raises some fresh questions. Some wonder if it will speed up the eventual exit of Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone. Under the terms of the deal he remains as chief executive but he has run the sport for nearly 40 years and is now 85. The new chairman of Formula 1 will be the elaborately moustachioed Chase Carey, the executive vice chairman of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox. \"I see great opportunity to help Formula 1 continue to develop and prosper for the benefit of the sport, fans, teams and investors alike,\" said Mr Carey on the announcement of the deal. Liberty Media now takes over from the Luxembourg-based investment fund CVC Capital Partners as the new owner of Formula 1 - subject to approval by regulators. It may not be a household name outside of the United States, but it is a major media conglomerate with stakes in several sports and entertainment businesses. Most notably these include the Atlanta Braves baseball club. The firm also has stakes in US cable TV firms, entertainment and ticket sales firms, and the satellite and online radio company Sirius XM. And it is just one of a number of telecoms and media conglomerates that are owned and controlled by 75-year-old billionaire businessman John Malone. Mr Malone started his career at AT&T in the 1960s and was for 23 years the chief executive of the US cable giant TCI. Unlike other media moguls he shuns the limelight. He has a reputation for having a formidable intellect and for being a business executive who takes a long view of markets. It has certainly paid off for him - he is now worth about $7bn. However, he is also said to have a ruthless streak. Back in the 1990s, as TCI boss, he was nicknamed \"Darth Vader\" by then US Vice President Al Gore when he put up cable customers' subscription rates. Mr Malone also owns two other major media conglomerates, Liberty Interactive and Liberty Global (he is chairman of all three firms). Liberty Interactive's subsidiaries include the home shopping channel QVC. UK-based Liberty Global is one of the world's biggest broadband internet service providers and international cable firms, with operations in 14 countries and 35,000 employees. Since 2013 it has been the owner of Virgin Media, and also has a minority stake in ITV. Mr Malone also has a significant stake in Barnes and Noble, the biggest retail bookseller in the US. Speaking of his business success he once said: \"You just have to be opportunistic, and try to figure out what creates value.\" Besides his media interests Mr Malone is also the largest private landowner in the US. He owns 2.1 million acres - that's nearly half the size of Wales - much of it in the US states of Maine and New Hampshire. So what new directions will F1 take? Formula 1 has 400 million viewers worldwide, but in the US has struggled to win audiences. US viewing figures have been rising since NBC Sports took over US domestic broadcast rights in 2013, and it is a trend that is set to continue - especially with this year's addition of an American based team, Haas F1. There is also likely to be a move to fully embrace new media and the digital marketplace, something that Mr Ecclestone's critics have said has held back the sport until now.

{"article": "Roberto Natto and Erika Reiser, both in their 60s, had been kidnapped and shot several miles from their ranch. Government officials say they were killed by a left-wing guerrilla group, the Paraguayan People's Army. Their bodies are due to be repatriated to Germany as an investigation into the killings continues. The couple had been held along with four ranch workers on their farm outside Yby Yau, around 395km  (245 miles) from Paraguay's capital, Asuncion. The workers had escaped but both Germans were killed. A government investigator said police had found the bodies after a shoot-out with fighters they allege belonged to the guerrilla group. The investigators said the guerrillas had been demanding money and food from local ranchers to be given to the poor as compensation for alleged deforestation. The Paraguayan People's Army (EPP) is estimated to number between 50 and 150 people. It has been blamed for a series of killings in the last few years. In May 2013 it was accused of killing Luis Lindstron, a former city mayor and owner of a logging operation. Various political leaders have tried to eliminate the EPP. In 2010, Fernando Lugo, who was president at the time, declared a state of emergency and sent 200 crack troops to find the rebels. In 2011 the government tried again, this time sending about 3,000 troops and police. Some arrests were made, but the group remained elusive. Correspondents say the EPP appears to be changing its strategy, focussing less on kidnappings and more on attacking ranches and trying to extract payments from landowners. Although little is known about them, the EPP appears to oppose industrialized agriculture, feeding off resentment in rural areas over the growth of large soybean farms, many of which are Brazilian-owned. They also draw on, and sometimes coerce, support from poor farmers in areas where the public services are minimal.", "question": "A German couple who had been farming in Paraguay for 30 years have been found shot dead at their ranch in the @placeholder of the country .", "option_0": "hands", "option_1": "wake", "option_2": "middle", "option_3": "north", "option_4": "south", "label": 3}
{"article": "Whether on Andrew Marr's comfy chair, behind a podium in Downing Street or on the front bench he is campaigning, slamming home a single point we will hear over and over again. With no deviation or hesitation, but constant repetition, he is telling those thinking of voting to leave the European Union they are contemplating a \"leap in the dark\". We will have to do our best over the coming weeks to find a torch and shine a little light into the shadows. It won't be easy. In truth, no post-referendum future is picked out by a spotlight, for with an EU in crisis over migration, contemplating closer banking union, the status quo is not a steady state. Even those who believe in historical or metaphysical predetermination do not claim to be able to follow the dark thread very far beyond the present. Follow updates on the BBC's live referendum page The UK's EU referendum: All you need to know UK and the EU: Better off out or in? Remain v Leave: Where do MPs stand? I'm itching to watch the last episode of Man in the High Castle, but the European debate has kept me from the couch. It is a TV drama set in a world where the Nazis win the war and the US is conquered, and divided between them and the Japanese Empire. There is no doubt counterfactual history makes for good \"faction\". Some think it is academically pointless, others that it has some merit. I have always thought it a worthwhile tool for thinking about causes and consequences, what is shaped by heroes and villains who grip history in their hands and what is moulded by amorphous forces of the economy. But perhaps what we need is conjectural history. Ironically, the key to what the UK would be like after leaving the EU is in the hands of the very organisation we would have just voted to leave. The reaction of the EU itself would make all the difference between an amicable divorce and a crime of passion. Discerning how 27 other governments will behave is never easy at the best of times. Predicting their reaction to a hypothetical vote in four months' time might seem as pointless as asking Schrodinger about the health of his cat. But trends will become clearer as the weeks pass. There is already a grave worry on the Continent that the British disease could be catching. The word they use is \"contagion\". If we vote to leave, there are those in France and Germany who won't want to make it a comfortable experience. If it looks too easy, others may be encouraged to follow. The Danish People's Party is already keen. But the big worry among the elite is France. Front National leader Marine Le Pen says she would be proud to call herself \"Madame Frexit\". If Britain's departure would leave a gaping hole in the EU, France following suit would pull out the foundation stones. The EU might survive in name, but it would become a very different creature if France left, or even had the same semi-detached relationship Mr Cameron is proposing for Britain. The \"outers\" might be right that a rational EU would not want to punish and alienate the UK, but would be quick to arrange a mutually beneficial arrangement that would encourage trade to continue much as before. There may be voices raised against those who fear the spread of the British disease. I suspect we could learn much by shining that torch in the direction of German industrialists, French financiers and Dutch manufacturers  and find out what they are telling their governments. But European politicians (as well of the rest of us) might want to know what sort of Britain they would face. The \"outers\" are a campaign for a one-off vote, not a nascent government. We don't know whether a government freed to close its borders to all other Europeans would actually do so. Would there be a quota system or a points system, a free for all or an outright ban, or perhaps a bar on Bulgarians but not Belgians? There is a big difference between these positions.  We must ask those who want the choice to be available, but we cannot know for sure what they would do with their new-found freedom. At one extreme, Britain out of the EU could negotiate access to the single market, free movement of our citizens and some voice in debates. At the other end, we could need visas to visit any EU country, suffer punitive tariffs on our goods and be given the cold shoulder. As the vote grows closer, I fully expect headlines on the lines of: \"France warns UK citizens will need visas\". There is another dark uncertainty. The prime minister has dismissed Boris Johnson's hint he favours a Leave vote followed by another negotiation, a better deal, and then a vote to stay. Other EU prime ministers and presidents are bound to be equally insistent this is a fantasy too far. The notion is certainly fraught with difficulties - not least the thought of a new Conservative leader, even a charismatic blond bombshell, executing a nimble pirouette to turn about face in defiance of a popular vote and thus deliberately reneging on the will of the people. But a pound to a pfennig someone would suggest it was worth a punt, and the mood across Europe might be in favour of making hitherto undreamt of concessions. Or they might say \"stuff it\" and leave the new leader gently rotating in the breeze. One way or another, we will be inching into the darkness in June - we will do what we can to illuminate the possible and the probable.", "question": "Earnest , passionate , and slightly shiny - the prime minister is in his @placeholder .

The New York Times reported earlier that Chinese hackers had \"persistently\" penetrated its systems for the last four months. Beijing has been accused by several governments and companies of carrying out cyber espionage for many years. China's foreign ministry dismissed the New York Times' accusations as \"groundless\" and \"totally irresponsible\". \"China is also a victim of hacking attacks. Chinese laws clearly forbid hacking attacks, and we hope relevant parties takes a responsible attitude on this issue,\" said spokesman Hong Lei. The Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Co, released a statement on Thursday saying hacking attacks related to its China coverage were \"an ongoing issue\". \"Evidence shows that infiltration efforts target the monitoring of the Journal's coverage of China, and are not an attempt to gain commercial advantage or to misappropriate customer information,\" a spokeswoman for the newspaper said. \"We continue to work closely with the authorities and outside security specialists, taking extensive measures to protect our customers, employees, journalists and sources.

Meanwhile, the New York Times said the attacks on its systems coincided with its investigative report into claims that the family of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao had amassed a multi-billion dollar fortune. The report, which was dismissed as a \"smear\" by the Chinese government, said Mr Wen's relatives had amassed assets worth at least $2.7bn (Â£1.7bn) through business dealings. It did not accuse the Chinese premier of wrongdoing. The hackers first broke into the Times' network in September, as the report was nearing completion, the paper reported. They used methods \"associated with the Chinese military\" to hack the computers of David Barboza, the paper's bureau chief in Shanghai who wrote the report, and one of his predecessors, Jim Yardley. Internet security firm Mandiant, which was hired by the Times to trace the attack, followed the hackers' movements for four months, to try to establish a pattern and block them. The hackers installed malware which enabled them to access any computer using the New York Times network, steal the password of every employee, and access 53 personal computers, mostly outside the Times offices. The Times said experts had found that the attacks \"started from the same university computers used by the Chinese military to attack United States military contractors in the past\".

The FCA said the bank's London and international operations had failed to look after their clients' investments. BNY Mellon said it regreted its failure, but insisted it had now improved its policies. The rules, improved after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, ring fence clients' assets if a firm becomes insolvent. When Lehman's collapsed, it was difficult to sort out which money belonged to the bank, and which to customers. In this case, BNY Mellon failed to account properly for shares, bonds and other investments, and, according to the FCA, would have found it difficult to return them quickly to the right clients. \"The firms' failure to comply with our rules was particularly serious given the systemically important nature of the firms, and the fact that safeguarding assets is core to their business,\" said Georgina Philippou,acting director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA. And she warned other banks and wealth management firms to take note. \"Other firms with responsibility for client assets should take this as a further warning that there is no excuse for failing to safeguard client assets.\" The Bank of New York Mellon Group is the world's largest global custody bank. The FCA investigated the bank's activities between 2007 and 2013, when the London and international operations of BNY Mellon held client funds worth up to £1.3 trillion and £236 billion respectively. The FCA said that the risks taken by the bank had been compounded by the stress in the financial markets at the time. In reaction, BNY Mellon said the fine would be fully covered by its reserves, and the company remained financially robust throughout the period in question. It said no client lost out as a result of the issues identified by the FCA. \"We have taken clear steps to put in place a framework of new and improved policies and operational procedures, as well as enhance our specialist resources,\" said a spokesperson.

{"article": "The former military test-pilot has just passed his final practical exams and is due to blast off to the International Space Station on 15 December. Along with Russian commander Yuri Malenchenko and Nasa astronaut Tim Kopra, he will spend 170 days in orbit, conducting scientific experiments and carrying out maintenance work on the vast flying laboratory. \"The launch, re-entry, the whole experience of being in weightlessness, if I get the opportunity to do a spacewalk - these are all absolute highlights of the mission,\" Mr Peake told the BBC at a Russian facility deep in a snowy forest on the edge of Moscow. It's where Yuri Gagarin also trained over half a century ago to be the first man in space. Mr Peake will be the first British astronaut on the ISS, flying from the European Space Agency. Since the US space shuttle programme was ended, the Russian spacecraft has been the only way up. So last week, the main three-man crew and their back-up team were put through two days of gruelling practical tests, including several hours squeezed inside a replica of the Soyuz capsule they'll travel in. Fully kitted-out in their space suits, the astronauts flew a simulation of the six-hour journey, tackling multiple malfunctions on their way. \"There are emergency drills to see how to act to save themselves and the spacecraft,\" trainer Georgy Pirogov explained, keeping an eye on the crew via a bank of video screens in a mini mission control. \"It could be a fire, loss of pressure or an emergency landing,\" he said. \"But in reality, most of it is automatic and ideally they should just sit and fly!\" The intense training programme has included living in a cave and deep under the sea. Yet of all things, Tim Peake says that it is learning Russian that has been \"a struggle\". Now fully qualified, he says he has \"no worries whatsoever\" about his first ever spaceflight. \"Flown astronauts have given me lots of advice,\" he says, equating the experience to learning to dive or to ski. He says there are plenty of mishaps as you adjust to a life in zero gravity, where you have to tether yourself to the wall to sleep, and to the toilet. \"After about two weeks they say you get into a pattern - how to eat, wash, use the loo - all the normal things we take for granted in our 1G [gravity] environment,\" he has been assured. The crew will undertake a full scientific programme on the ISS, conducting more than 250 experiments over their six-month mission - many on their own bodies. They include research on the human immune system and the ageing process. Some of the crew's baggage allowance will be taken up by that research kit. But as well as family photographs, Tim Peake says he'll be taking some personal items to be \"flown in space\", that he plans to give to his sons when they turn 18. And on the advice of former astronauts, he'll also make space for one vital item: sticky-tape. \"They say if you leave anything, you turn around and it won't be there,\" he laughed, recalling the top tip for life 400km (248 miles) above Earth. The final \"graduation\" ceremony at Star City takes place next week, attended by the astronauts' families. Then it's into the obligatory quarantine, ahead of the launch. \"The whole experience is a huge privilege,\" the British spaceman reflects, unruffled as ever. \"But seeing that first view of planet Earth from space is probably going to be the most exciting moment.\"", "question": "British astronaut Tim Peake says he 's \" definitely ready \" for his first space flight , finally fulfilling a childhood @placeholder after two and a half years of intensive training .", "option_0": "group", "option_1": "era", "option_2": "name", "option_3": "story", "option_4": "ambition", "label": 4}
{"article": "We have learned that the initial response to an outbreak must be robust and complete so that the outbreak does not spread from rural areas, where it emerges from an animal source in nature, into neighbouring countries and urban areas. We have also learned that community engagement is of the utmost importance - helping village elders, paramount chiefs and others understand how the disease is transmitted and how it can be stopped, including emphasis on safe burial practices. Equally important is contact tracing - and daily monitoring of the temperature of those who are known to have been in contact with a patient - for three weeks, in order to identify those who are potentially infected with Ebola; and surveillance to identify patients and ensure their transport and management in a health facility where infection control is up to standard. Ebola transmission is amplified if patients are admitted to health facilities where infection control is sub-standard; and where health workers inadvertently become infected and then unintentionally infect their family members, spreading the infection to the community. Health workers are often infected because it is impossible to diagnose Ebola early - it has signs and symptoms similar to other infections such as malaria - and they are therefore at great risk of infection. It has been shown that the Ebola virus does not cause major outbreaks where health facility infection control is up to standard. The best means of dealing with an international health crisis is prevention - it has been known, for example, since 1976 that it is sub-standard health facility infection control that permits Ebola to spread, yet sub-standard infection control continues in many facilities.  Emphasis must be placed on helping health facilities understand and use infection control measures as part of their routine activities. The International Health Regulations are international laws that are meant to help prevent the international spread of disease, and they required countries to develop standard core capacity in public health between the years 2007 and 2014, yet many countries did not accomplish this and continue to be at great risk of not detecting and responding to outbreaks early, when their spread can be prevented. There continue to be many infectious disease risks that can spread internationally - some of them are known, others unknown. Those that are known include infections resistant to the medicines used to cure them (antimicrobial resistant infections). Infections such as Dengue,  Chikungunya, and cholera all continue to spread throughout the world. Those that are unknown - they emerge from a source in nature to infect humans - sometimes also have the potential to spread internationally. Sars in 2003 is an example - and others, such as Ebola, re-emerge from time to time. It is impossible to predict when these latter, emerging infections, will emerge or re-emerge, so it is important that all countries develop the public health capacity to detect and respond to infectious diseases when and where they emerge or re-emerge. The way forward must therefore include stronger government engagement in developing core capacities in public health so that outbreaks can be rapidly identified and contained when and where they occur; and strengthening of global alert and response mechanisms to ensure a rapid and robust response - a safety net when countries are unable to detect and contain outbreaks on their own.

{"article": "\"The Middle East is totally destabilised, a total and complete mess,\" he told a rally back in December 2015. \"I wish we had the four or five trillion dollars that we have spent, and had spent it in the United States,\" he said, to rapturous applause. This view that the Middle East is a distraction - a place from which no good can come - has been a consistent theme throughout his rise to the presidency. Mr Trump wants to focus on one thing: the fight against so-called Islamic State. But wishing away the rest of the region's problems, many of which contribute to phenomena like IS and Al Qaida linked groups, will not be easy. Veteran US diplomat Ambassador Dennis Ross insists that a Trump administration cannot turn its back on the Middle East. When I spoke to him during his recent trip to London he told me that things are not just bad in the region but getting worse. \"The Trump administration,\" he said, \"will confront a set of challenges that no previous American president has faced.\" This is because, in his view, the nature of the conflicts in the region - look at Syria and Iraq - are threatening the state system itself. \"That,\" he says, \"has never been the case before. However IS is handled,\" he told me, \"you run the risk of what comes in the aftermath of its defeat. You have a proxy war in Yemen between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\" He also mentioned the growing crisis in Egypt - a country of 93 million people that is facing such basic economic problems that it has shortages of sugar and cooking oil. \"The West,\" he said, \"simply couldn't risk Egypt becoming a failed state.\" So the Trump administration and especially its European allies will continue to suffer from the bow wave of consequences that is being produced by the Middle East's problems. What then of the Middle East's most intractable problem - the struggle between Israel and the Palestinians? Mr Trump has claimed that he will be able to resolve this where others have failed. But the signals he's been sending suggest support for a more hawkish Israeli policy. He has chosen a US ambassador to Israel who is a strong backer of the Jewish settlement movement in the occupied West Bank. And Mr Trump has some plans to shake things up himself insisting that he will move the US embassy - currently in Tel Aviv - to what he called \"the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem\". To be fair, many US presidents have similarly talked about relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem, but it has never happened.  It's a step that most Palestinians would see as prejudging the outcome of the conflict, marking the end of Washington's support for a genuine two-state solution. The Obama administration's last-minute diplomatic gambit (as it would have it) to save the two-state solution may actually make any progress towards a settlement during the Trump presidency even less likely. By refusing to veto the UN resolution declaring the illegality of the settlement enterprise the outgoing administration, whatever else it may have done, has pushed  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even further into the embrace of Donald Trump, whose own comments suggest little understanding of the nuances of the issue. While Secretary of State John Kerry's valedictory speech eloquently enshrined the principles on which a two-state solution must be based, there seems little chance of progress in the immediate future. The Palestinians' strategy of internationalisation of the conflict seems to be paying dividends and they have no reason to give ground in the short-term. Meanwhile Israel's right-wing government feels betrayed - and is in no mind to halt settlement construction. It is very hard to see a Trump administration having the diplomatic finesse, time or inclination to start unpicking this problem. The simple fact is that, right now, few experts see the Israeli-Palestinian problem as the central issue in the region any more. It deserves a solution but both sides are too divided to make any progress. Ambassador Ross believes, though, that there is one small glimmer of opportunity. Iran's rising influence in the region is a concern for both Israel and moderate Arab states alike. There is what Ross calls \"a convergence of strategic interests\" between Israel and many of the Sunni Arab states. They cannot make peace on behalf of the Palestinians, he notes, but they could help to broker a deal. However, Ambassador Ross does not seem to have much faith in the future Trump administration's ability to navigate the shoals of Middle Eastern diplomacy. If a Trump administration seeks to turn its back on nation building in the Middle East what then of its approach towards the Syrian crisis? The drama there is both a national tragedy and a regional crisis. The Assad regime now appears to be an immovable fixture - thanks to Russian and Iranian support. Mr Trump has hinted that he would like to do a deal with Moscow to combat IS. But this would mean accepting Iran's growing influence in the region. According to Professor Joshua Landis, director of the Centre for Middle Eastern Studies at Oklahoma University, this highlights a contradiction that has been at the heart of US policy ever since the overthrow of the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. \"President Trump,\" he told me, \"is going to confront the same dilemma that the United States has been confronting for decades, which is we don't like Iran. We see the Iranian revolution as  being detrimental to American interests. But at the same time,\" he says, \"we've been pursuing a military strategy in Iraq and Syria that is very pro-Iranian.\" By this he means that everything the US has done - destroying the Baathist regime in Iraq, for example, which was a strategic counterweight to Tehran, has served to benefit Iran's position. \"That dilemma,\" he told me, \"is going to remain in a Trump presidency. And even though his generals are very anti-Iran they're also anti-IS. And they're going to prioritize the destruction of IS over containing Iran which means the continued spread of Iranian power. \" On the campaign trail Mr Trump continually castigated the nuclear deal with Tehran that sought to constrain its nuclear programme. So, as president, could he simply tear up the international agreement? Perhaps, but such a step would leave the US badly isolated and Iran free to pursue its nuclear programme wherever it might lead. Instead, some analysts suggest that he might seek to push Tehran into a position where it walks away from the deal. It's a sensitive time: Iranian President Hassan Rohani is facing elections in May. And, as Trita Parsi, president of the Washington DC-based National Iranian-American Council explains, this could lead to a hardening of positions on both sides. \"If the Trump administration adopts a very hostile position towards Iran, that will definitely boost the opponents of the deal in Tehran,\" he told me. In which case Rohani \"may end up having a very difficult time getting re-elected. And if he loses he will likely lose to a president who ran on a platform criticising the deal.\" Then both the United States and Iran will have presidents by mid-2017 who are opposed to the deal and that will definitely present a significant challenge to the durability of the nuclear agreement. Many experts believe that reducing Washington's engagement with the Middle East to the battle against IS will be an unrealisable aspiration for the Trump presidency. Ambassador Dennis Ross believes that there can be no US pivot away from the region. Its problems are just too great. \"I like to say about the Middle East - the problems of the Middle East never stay in the Middle East and there is no better example of that than the war in Syria and its implications for Europe because of what it has produced with regard to the flow of refugees.\" And he had a grim warning of what might lie ahead. \"If we get this wrong, what we've seen flowing out of Syria will be a pittance compared to what it may be.  That's a very powerful reason why we have to get it right,\" he said. \"These are very big issues with high stakes.\"", "question": "As president , Donald Trump will enter the White House with few expectations of the Middle East .

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device Twenty-four hours on from Usain Bolt's triumph in the men's 100m, Fraser-Pryce repeated her Olympic victory in this same stadium seven years ago as she held off the fast-finishing Dafne Schippers in 10.76 seconds. For Schippers - the former heptathlete who only decided to switch full-time to sprinting in June this year - her silver in a huge personal best of 10.81 brought both vindication and wild celebration. USA's Tori Bowie took bronze in 10.86, but as in 2008 this was the Fraser-Pryce show. Media playback is not supported on this device Just as her compatriot Bolt is the undisputed greatest sprinter the world has seen, so the 28-year-old can lay claim to the same title: twice Olympic champion over 100m, world champion three times over that distance and both world and Olympic titles over 200m too. With her long plaits dyed green and a headband of daisies around her forehead [she owns a beauty parlour in her country's capital, Kingston] Fraser-Pryce did not get her trademark explosive start. Schippers was out faster, but by 50m the Jamaican had opened up a two-metre lead over the tall Dutch athlete, and although Schippers was closing at the death, she had enough to hold her lead through the line. \"I'm getting tired of 10.7s. I just want to put a good race together and hopefully in the next race I get the time I'm working for,\" Fraser-Pryce told BBC Sport. \"I definitely think a 10.6 is there. Hopefully I will get it together.\" Canada's Shawn Barber pulled off the shock of the championships so far by snatching pole vault gold from world-record holder and Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie. The 21-year-old's first-time clearance at 5.90 metres put pressure on the French favourite, who jumped 6.05m earlier this year but had to settle for bronze here after three failures at the same height. Media playback is not supported on this device Germany's Raphael Holzdeppe cleared 5.90m on his third attempt but could not improve when the bar was raised to 6m, leaving Barber - whose father George competed in this event at the World Championships in 1983 - with his first global title.

Columbia's defending world champion Caterine Ibarguen retained her triple jump title with a fourth round 14.90m, with no other athlete going past 14.78. But there will be no gold this summer for Keshorn Walcott, Trinidad's 22-year-old Olympic javelin champion, who crashed out in qualifying with a best throw of 76.83m. Britain's Rabah Yousif produced a fine run of 44.54, a personal best by almost half a second, to qualify for Tuesday's 400m final as a fastest loser. Yousif, who came to Britain from Sudan 13 years ago and has an English wife, improved dramatically on his first-round performance as others who had lit up the heats struggled 24 hours on. Team captain Martyn Rooney had set a new personal best of 44.45 in the heats but, perhaps tired, he was unable to reproduce that run and came home sixth in the third semi-final in 45.29, Olympic champion Kirani James (44.16) and Botswana's Isaac Makwala (44.11) the most impressive semi-final winners.

{"article": "Head teachers are welcoming changes that means from next year, schools will be measured on a broader range of results across eight subjects. The government says schools have risen to its moves to toughen standards. The number of schools falling below the current floor standard has remained stable at 312. Secondary schools are \"underperforming\" if fewer than 40% of pupils get five GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English and maths, and if the school has a below average score for pupils' progress. The data is based on examinations taken last summer. Overall, there was a small rise in the percentage of pupils gaining five good GCSEs, including English and maths, to 57.1% - up from 56.6% in 2014, the data shows. Tap here to search for the results for your area. Head teachers have long complained measuring success on the basis of GCSE results alone is unfair as it does not take into account the intake of the school. But ministers have maintained parents want and need simple and easy-to-digest information about schools. The difference in achievement by gender is startling, with roughly a fifth fewer boys than girls reaching the end of Key Stage 4 with a good set of GCSEs in state schools. Some 61.8% of girls got five good GCSEs, including English and maths, compared with 52.5% of their male peers. And fewer boys than girls made at least the expected level of progress - 65.9% of boys opposed to 76.5% of girls. More girls (29.3%) than boys achieved the English Baccalaureate (EBacc), which requires GCSEs in two sciences, a language, history or geography, as well as English and maths. Only 19.5% of boys obtained it. Overall, 24.3% of pupils achieved the EBacc. There was also a marked difference between the performance of disadvantaged pupils (those eligible for the pupil premium) and their more advantaged peers, with just 36.7% getting five good GCSEs, including maths and English, compared to 64.7%. The poorest performing local authority was Knowsley on Merseyside, where 37.4%  of pupils met the required standard, compared to the national average of 57.1%. From next year, schools in England will be measured on what is known as Progress 8. Progress 8 will replace the five or more good GCSEs, including maths and English, benchmark as the key measure for all secondary schools. Progress 8 assesses the progress pupils make between Key Stage 2 tests taken at the end of primary school and their performance in a specified mixture of eight subjects at the end of secondary school. Schools will be given a score based on how their pupils have progressed compared to the national average. This year, schools were given the option to \"opt in\" for Progress 8 and 327 schools (around 10%) took this up. Schools Minister Nick Gibb paid tribute to the hard work of teachers and pupils, saying schools were already responding to his government's reforms, \"leading to higher standards and transforming young people's life chances\". \"Our academies programme is revolutionising the school system, with converter academies leading the way and sponsored academies turning round schools which previously would have been left to languish. \"Our reforms to GCSEs and A-levels are based on the highest possible aspirations for our young people -  providing a broad and balanced education and equipping them with the knowledge, skills and qualifications which will set them up to succeed.\" The Association of School and College Leaders said this year's performance data represented the end of the school league tables \"as we know them\". Deputy general secretary Malcolm Trobe said the new progress measure, known as \"Progress 8\", which is based on pupils' progress in a broader ranger of subjects was a fairer way of judging schools. \"Measuring schools on GCSE attainment does not take into account the fact that children are at different points when they start their secondary education. \"Schools may be doing a fantastic job in helping struggling pupils make great progress, but judging them on GCSE results does not reflect this because it is based on the grades achieved rather than the progress made. \"This particularly penalises schools in challenging areas. It can unfairly stigmatise schools which are actually doing some superb work in difficult circumstances and this can be damaging to the morale of school leaders, staff, pupils, parents and communities.\" National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Russell Hobby said the number of changes in what statistics were gathered made the data dubious. \"We desperately need stable measures of a stable examination system,\" he said. \"We need this in order for data to become meaningful again. \"We need this, above all, so that schools and teachers can focus on teaching to the best of their ability rather than coping with constant change. \"The time of change is not over yet, as the government plans to revise the way the EBacc [English Baccalaureate] is used in future performance tables.\" The Department for Education publishes an extensive range of data on school performance every year. It uses this data to create and publish league tables by local authority for England's schools. The school league tables only cover education in England, as Wales and Northern Ireland abolished league tables in 2001, followed by Scotland in 2003. Scottish exam data is still published online, but it is not in a format where schools can be easily compared.

{"article": "Ministers plan to overhaul the system in September 2017 and charge those studying to be front-line health workers for their degrees. But in a letter to the prime minister, more than 20 groups led by the Royal College of Nursing said it could put people off working for the NHS. The government said the changes would create 10,000 more training places. The move comes as nurses and doctors gather for their annual conferences. The RCN conference gets under way in Glasgow on Sunday, while the British Medical Association meets in Belfast from Monday. Currently student nurses, midwives and other staff such as physiotherapists are entitled to bursaries of £4,500 to £5,500 - on top of a grant of £1,000 each year during their training. The course fees are also covered. Those studying for advanced roles, such as district nurses, could also be affected. But the government has proposed scrapping these and introducing university fees to bring health staff in line with other students. Ministers argue that the move will lead to an increase in nurse students - of about 10,000 - as applicants for courses currently outnumber the places available by two to one. This is because there is a cap on places. But the letter, which has been signed by the BMA and the Patients Association, warned it was an \"untested gamble\" and urged the government to halt the plans to properly consider their impact. RCN general secretary Janet Davies said that as nurses spent about half of their degree course working in the NHS it amounted, in effect, to \"asking people to pay to go to work\". \"It feels very wrong,\" she added. She also expressed concern about the state of the NHS. Figures released last month showed NHS trusts in England recorded their worst ever deficit in 2015-16 with an overspend of £2.45bn. Meanwhile, performance targets for A&E, ambulance services and cancer care are all being missed in England. Other parts of the UK are also struggling. An online poll of UK nurses by the RCN found only one in 10 thought the health service was able to meet demand. The BMA has released a survey of its own - of 1,240 members of the public in England. It suggested eight in 10 were worried about the future of the health service. The poll - carried out by Britain Thinks - also found fewer than one in five trusted the government with the management of the NHS and only one in eight believed it was getting the money it needed. More than half felt the NHS was going to get worse - with just 14% saying they would expect it to get better. BMA leader Dr Mark Porter said a long-term plan was needed to address the \"crisis\" in the NHS. \"People are increasingly concerned about the future of a health service that they know is under unsustainable pressure.\" A Department of Health spokeswoman insisted the plans for students would lead to more people studying as the caps would be lifted. But she urged those concerned to take part in the continuing consultations on the issue. A Department of Health spokesman said: \"We need more home-grown nurses in the NHS because they do an amazing job caring for patients, but currently two-thirds of people who apply to become a nurse aren't accepted for training. \"Our plans mean up to 10,000 more training places by the end of this parliament, with student nurses getting around 25% more financial support whilst they study.\" On the wider concerns about the NHS, the Department of Health said the extra funding being provided this Parliament would \"transform services\".", "question": "Plans to scrap bursaries for student nurses and other NHS staff in England are reckless , @placeholder and charities say .", "option_0": "according", "option_1": "state", "option_2": "chilling", "option_3": "safeguarding", "option_4": "unions", "label": 4}

{"article": "Migrants are not only joining local congregations, but setting up their own churches too. The number of churches in Northern Ireland led by migrants has risen to more than 30 in recent years. These new churches are not only attracting people from ethnic minorities, but intriguing locals. The Redeemed Christian Church of God is a Nigerian-based church, but has become the fastest growing denomination in the UK and Ireland. They have set up three churches in Northern Ireland within the last eight years. The congregation includes people from a variety of African nations, the Caribbean, and both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Chris Ifonlaja, who runs one of their Belfast churches with his wife, says it appeals to people because it is a \"neutral place\". \"We did not experience the Troubles,\" he said. \"We see that as a blessing because we don't see all of the division, we just see people.\" The couple said they were conscious of the possibility that migrants joining their church may be slower to integrate into Northern Ireland. Angela Ifonlaja said \"we didn't come to run a church for migrants, it's just a church\". \"But I think what happens is when you go into a place where you are new in that place, it's natural that you gravitate towards those that you identify with, at least on a physical level,\" she added. Other churches have decided to make a permanent physical commitment to Northern Ireland. Iglesia Ni Cristo or Church of Christ, are headquartered in the Philippines. They began meeting in a house in Belfast 10 years ago with only a handful of people. In 2014, they purchased an old church on University Avenue and refurbished the whole building. The converted church has only been open a few months. Brother Philip Velasquez is the minister, and he said that his church is reversing the traditional flow of mission. \"It is very rare for a religious organisation which began in the far east - in an impoverished country - to actually spread its mission throughout the whole world to first world countries,\" he said. \"We're not only growing because of the immigration of Filipinos but also because of the conversion of many people who belong to those first world countries.\" These new churches may still be small in number, but they are seeing growth at a time when many traditional churches are losing members, and are challenging the old divisions in Northern Ireland.

{"article": "The Daily Telegraph said McKinnon is seeking compensation from the NRL and the player whose tackle injured him. The NRL confirmed to the BBC it had been contacted by McKinnon's lawyer, but said no claim had been lodged. The former Newcastle Knights player, 24, must use a wheelchair for life. He suffered extensive spinal injuries in the spear tackle by Melbourne Storm players in 2014. The lawsuit reportedly names Storm player Jordan McLean, who was banned for seven matches for the dangerous tackle. The Rugby League Players Association (RLPA) backed McKinnon on Monday, saying his injury was \"life changing\". \"Alex has the right to pursue any and all legal options available to him in relation to his injury and it is appropriate that he has engaged his own legal representatives to assist him,\" the RLPA said in a statement. \"We also recognise there has been an emotional toll on those who played and officiated in the game between the Newcastle Knights and Melbourne Storm and particularly on those involved in the incident that resulted in the injury to Alex. \"From the RLPA's perspective, we will seek to ensure that the rights of all parties are protected throughout any legal process that might eventuate.\" McKinnon received the NRL's maximum compensation payout of A$500,000 (Â£292,452; $364,728) following the incident. He received a further A$1.5m through a Rise For Alex fundraising campaign. Newcastle also paid McKinnon A$750,000 to honour a contract extension he was offered before his injury. He is currently employed by the club in a player recruitment role. McKinnon last year mentioned the possibility of legal action in his autobiography, Unbroken. \"If you do something illegal while driving a car and render somebody for the rest of their life in a wheelchair, you pay the consequences,\" he wrote.

{"article": "Britain's Sunday People newspaper quoted the father as saying: \"We want the world to know her real name.\" But Indian media later said the father denied giving consent for her name to be revealed. Indian law protects sex crime victims by prohibiting identification. One minister, Shashi Tharoor, has urged authorities to reveal the name so it can be used for a new anti-rape law. The woman, 23, died last weekend in a hospital in Singapore from injuries suffered during last month's attack. The father was quoted as telling the Sunday People: \"My daughter didn't do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself. \"I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter.\" However, the Hindustan Times later quoted the father as saying he would want the name made public only if a law was named after her. \"I have only said we won't have any objection if the government uses my daughter's name for a new law for crime against women that is more stringent and better framed that the existing one,\" the Indian paper quoted him as saying. The laws on identification were introduced to protect victims from the social stigma associated with rape, and apply even after the death of the victim. Although the system has not always been watertight, the high-profile case has brought a tough stance from the authorities. Police filed a case against broadcaster Zee News after it carried an interview with the friend who was with the victim during the attack. The victim's friend was not named but his face was shown and police are investigating whether Zee News broke broadcasting laws relating to disclosure of the victim's identity. However, it remains unclear what could be done if the father chose to publicly name his daughter. Last week, Mr Tharoor, the junior education minister, called on the authorities to reveal the name of the gang-rape victim so that the new anti-rape law could be named after her. He wrote: \"Unless her parents object, she should be honoured and the revised anti-rape law named after her. She was a human being with a name, not just a symbol.\" The Sunday People said the father had given it permission to name him and his daughter. It carried a photograph of the father but said the family had requested no photograph of the victim be used. In the interview, the father also renewed his calls for the men who carried out the attack to be hanged. \"Death for all six of them. These men are beasts. They should be made an example of and that society will not allow such things to happen,\" he said. Five men have been charged with abduction, rape and murder. A sixth suspect is expected to be tried as a juvenile. A pre-court hearing for the five was held in the Saket area of the Indian capital on Saturday and the men have been summoned to appear in court on Monday. In his interview with Zee News, the friend said he and the rape victim had boarded a bus after a trip to the cinema and after failing to flag down an auto-rickshaw. He said the bus had tinted windows, and that he believed the group of men had laid a trap for them. He confirmed that the assailants had later thrown them off the bus and tried to run them over. The case has caused a national outcry, and there have been frequent protests calling for greater protection for women.

{"article": "Kenya beat Guinea-Bissau's closest challengers Congo Brazzaville 2-1 in Group E to secure an historic qualification for the African minnows who defeated Zambia on Saturday. Zimbabwe were 3-0 winners over Malawi in Harare, and Ghana won 2-0 away to Mauritius. Guinea-Bissau, from the tiny former Portuguese colony in West Africa, bolstered their chances of a first Cup of Nations appearance after a 3-2 win over 2012 champions Zambia on Saturday in front of a packed 20,000-capacity national stadium in Bissau. But they needed Congo Brazzaville to lose in Kenya to seal their place in Gabon, and Kenya duly obliged, coming from behind to seal a 2-1 victory in Nairobi. Congo took an early lead in the Group E match through Ismael Gonzalez who converted a 19th minute penalty. But the Harambee Stars came back with goals from Ayub Timbe and Eric Johanna to seal Guinea-Bissau's qualification. Guinea-Bissau, captained by France-based Bocundji Ca (pictured) have 10 points in Group E, four more than Zambia and Congo Brazzaville. Kenya are bottom, two points further adrift. Guided by local coach Baciro Cande, Guinea-Bissau - who have never been inside the world's top 100 in the Fifa rankings - were considered outsiders when qualifying kicked off last June. They have a population of just 1.7 million and no professional league, and with their financial problems they have regularly been unable to enter teams in continental competition. But home and away victories over Kenya three months ago helped them upset the odds to win the group. Ghana went into their game away to Mauritius as favourites to win Group H even without captain and leading striker Asamoah Gyan, who has a thigh injury. The Black Stars did not disappoint despite a cagey first half which ended without any goals. Swansea's Andre Ayew (pictured) broke the deadlock in the 71st minute with a strike from close-range to relieve some of the tension. Christian Atsu doubled Ghana's score seven minutes later, finding the net following a pass from defender Baba Rahman. The victory means that Ghana have qualified for their seventh successive Africa Cup of Nations finals since 2006. Zimbabwe clinched a place at Gabon 2017 with a 3-0 win over Malawi in Harare while their Group L rivals Guinea fell 1-0 in Swaziland. Knowledge Musona was fouled inside the box and converted the penalty on 16 minutes to set up the convincing home victory for the Warriors. Recently crowned South African Footballer of the Season, Khama Billiat, doubled the lead on 36 minutes, firing in from close range. Roared on by a 40,000 crowd at the national stadium, Zimbabwe struck again a minute from time through a Cuthbert Malajila header. In Group B, the Democratic Republic of Congo moved closer to the finals with a resounding 6-1 win in Madagascar but Central African Republic's 3-1 win over visiting Angola stopped DR Congo from qualifying. Cedric Bakambu and Paul-José M'Poku both hit a brace for DR Congo in Madagascar, with Crystal Palace's recently married winger Yannick Bolasie, and Jordan Rolly Botaka also scoring. Jhon Baggio Rakotonomenjanahary did score a consolation goal for the hosts, but they remain bottom of the group with just two points. CAR's win meant they closed the gap on DR Congo to two points with the group now set to be decided in the final round of qualifiers in September. It is a similar situation in Group D where Burkina Faso beat Comoros 1-0 on Sunday to go joint top with Uganda ahead of the last round of qualifying. Group A will also be decided in the final round, after Liberia drew 2-2 with visitors Togo to go joint top with Tunisia. Togo came from 2-0 down to secure a precious point. Gizzie Dorbor and William Jebor put Liberia in front before Floyd Ayite and Kodjo Laba drew Togo level. Liberian players were holed up in their dressing room for more than an hour after the match to avoid an angry crowd waiting outside the stadium. Elsewhere, two goals from Getaneh Kebede helped Ethiopia win 2-1 away to Lesotho in Group J, to boost their hopes of finishing as one of the best runners-up. The Group C game between Benin and Equatorial Guinea - originally scheduled for 5 June - has been postponed until Sunday 12 June. as long as Benin fulfil conditions set out by Fifa. These are the penultimate qualifiers, with the group winners and the best two runners-up qualifying for the finals along with hosts Gabon.

{"article": "Optimism fell for the third consecutive quarter according to the CBI employers group. It is the sector's longest period of falling sentiment since 2009 - in the midst of the financial crisis. The survey of 115 companies found low interest rates and potential restricted EU market access were seen as risks. But while 28% of the respondents were gloomier, 15% were more optimistic. And almost 40% of the firms surveyed reported healthy profits in the last quarter. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, blamed the dip in sentiment on the \"uncertainty caused by Brexit to low interest rates, technological change and strong competition\". She called on the chancellor Philip Hammond to \"set a clear direction for growth and prosperity\" in his Autumn Statement in November. \"With firms voicing strong concerns about the impact of Brexit, especially the risks to the wider economy in the years ahead, the government must allay their unease with clear plans for negotiations to leave the EU,\" Ms Newton-Smith added. The CBI campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU ahead of June's referendum. Meanwhile, a separate report by the manufacturers' organisation EEF found that the UK's industrial sector had continued to strengthen in 2016, and British firms had created more jobs than equivalent companies in other developed counties, with the exception of the US. Manufacturing only accounts for around 10% of the UK economy, but Lee Hopley, EEF's chief economist, said the sector's success was vital to the country's overall growth. \"This is especially important in a post-Brexit world,\" Mr Hopley added, \"where we have to look at possibly all new avenues of generating growth and investment\".", "question": "UK financial services firms are becoming more pessimistic about their prospects in the @placeholder of the Brexit vote , an industry survey suggests .", "option_0": "wake", "option_1": "head", "option_2": "end", "option_3": "aftermath", "option_4": "space", "label": 0}

Some analysts have likened the shock of a Trump victory to the Brexit result earlier this year. However neither markets nor currencies have swung as wildly as they did after June's EU referendum - and many Asian markets saw losses narrow towards the end of Wednesday trading. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong finished 2.2% lower and the Shanghai Composite lost 0.6%. Australia's ASX 200 finished down 1.9% while the Kospi in South Korea ended 2.7% lower. US stock futures fell sharply with the Dow Jones index expected to lose more than 4% - 800 points when it reopens. London's FTSE 100 index is predicted to lose more than 3%. A victory for Donald Trump has been widely seen as negative for Asia's economies because of his protectionist rhetoric. He's talked about slapping tariffs on Chinese imports, and punishing companies that send their work overseas. Whether he makes good on those threats, and whether his promises turn into policies, we'll have to wait and see. But in the meantime, investors have made their own minds up about what a Trump presidency will mean for Asia, and judging by their reaction, it's not good. On the trading floor that I've been at all day in Singapore, some traders have shaken their heads in disbelief.

They had been to the hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. The president was unhurt, but his wife and and a number of others were injured when the device went off under a seat normally - but not in this instance - occupied by Mr Yameen.

Wales has about 75% of UK flowering plants, and the database has 1,143 plants and conifers. Barcodes are short DNA sequences and plants can be identified from pollen grains, seed pieces, or roots and wood. Other plants introduced by humans will form the next phase of the three-year project. PhD student Jenny Hawkins is working on a joint project between the garden and the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Cardiff University to DNA barcode honey. She has collected honey from across the UK and is testing its ability to kill hospital acquired infections such as MRSA. She will then DNA barcode the honey to find out what plants bees visited to make it. Ms Hawkins said: \"By DNA barcoding the honey, we are looking for links between honey with good medicinal properties and particular plant species. \"If we find it, we might be able to make a super honey by allowing bees to forage on plants that provide high antibacterial properties.\" The Barcode Wales project has been led by Dr Natasha de Vere, head of conservation and research from the National Botanic Garden in Carmarthenshire. She said: \"Wales is now in the unique position of being able to identify plant species from materials which in the past would have been incredibly difficult or impossible. \"Through the Barcode Wales project, we have created a powerful platform for a broad range of research from biodiversity conservation to human health.\" The Welsh flora DNA barcodes are available on the             Barcode of Life Database  (BOLD) for use by researchers throughout the world. DNA barcoding may be able to help in the crisis facing pollinating insects such as bees, according to Dr de Vere. She is working with PhD student Andrew Lucas from the Swansea Ecology Research Team (SERT) at Swansea University to investigate the role hoverflies play in pollination.

{"article": "Paris is recounting an awards ceremony she attended the night before. \"I was like, oh my God, all these people know who I am now,\" she says. \"It was like a sit-down dinner thing and I was at the top table with Ed Miliband and everything. \"Cher was there. I felt lucky just to be in the room.\" The party - hosted by leading gay magazine Attitude - may have been glamorous but Paris was invited because of her work as a journalist, broadcaster and activist. With the organisation All About Trans she is determinedly changing media representation of transgender people like herself. And as the first transgender presenter for Radio 1 and Channel 4, she is making a mainstream audience aware of trans issues. Read more about Paris on her blog, Last of the Clean Bohemians It's hard to believe she had difficulty leaving the house a few years ago and could not get a job answering phones because of her criminal record. \"I genuinely thought I wouldn't be able to function or have a normal life or do anything so it's gobsmacking that I've got any semblance of normality, let alone do all these fabulous things,\" she says. Paris, now 25, grew up as a boy in the former mining town of Hucknall, in Nottinghamshire. She assumed she was gay, until she served eight months in a young offenders institution for a robbery she committed when she was 16. \"I was just a naive teenager when they sent me away,\" she says. \"I had dropped out of college. Basically, I had gone off the rails because I was terrified of going to prison. I ended up taking lots of drugs. \"I had a lot of time for thinking when I was in prison.\" Paris felt like she was at \"the bottom of society\" but had a vision of who she wanted to be. The vision included giving up smoking, going back to college to do her A-levels, and becoming female. \"I put all of it together and it just felt absolutely insurmountable,\" she says. \"I just thought, 'I'm this silly teenage boy in a prison cell who has made a huge mistake and I want to be this happy person'.\" Paris worked hard and was released early on a curfew, but she carried on living as a boy when she went back to college. \"I knew I wanted a transition and I was so jealous of all the girls at college that looked pretty and had boys talking to them and all those things,\" she says. \"I didn't feel like I could transition at college because it was a little bit rough. I didn't think I could face it.\" Paris was living with her grandmother, who died shortly before Paris received her A-level results. \"She died and I just thought, 'do you know what, life is too short. I can't do this, I need to express myself and who I am'.\" Paris stopped wearing boyish clothes and moved to Brighton to study English at university. \"In the space of six weeks I went from living in Nottingham as a boy with my grandma still alive, to living in Brighton as a girl,\" she says. \"I thought, 'this is the start of a new chapter. Everyone will accept me as a girl now'.\" However, the change wasn't straightforward, and Paris went through periods when she couldn't leave the house or sleep properly. \"I didn't blend in as much as I do now,\" she says. \"I would sometimes get abuse in the street: 'You're a bloke. You're a tranny'. \"I didn't tell people I was transgender. I just didn't want people to know. I thought it was something to be ashamed of.\" One of her low points was being turned down for a part-time job answering phones - because of her criminal record rather than being transgender. \"I can't begin to tell you how small it made me feel when they told me I couldn't have a job answering the phone,\" she says. But Paris had what she describes as an epiphany. \"I just thought, 'I don't deserve this. I'm trying to put my life back on track and I'm not going to be ashamed',\" she says. \"When I realised I would like to change society, not myself, all these good things have come into my life.\" A doctor referred Paris to Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic while she was living in Brighton and she began treatment. Paris also met her boyfriend while living in Brighton in a bar when he was visiting for the weekend. \"It was just after I had started my hormones. I think I was going out more and I started looking and feeling better,\" she says. \"I wouldn't be able to do what I'm doing if I wasn't in a relationship. My partner helps me out and provides stability.\" Paris and her boyfriend now live together in east London. She founded META, a digital magazine for trans people, but is now concentrating on freelance writing. She started her career writing for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) press, but now also writes for newspapers including the Guardian, Independent and Telegraph. She regularly goes back to Nottinghamshire and is proud to hail from the same county as Alan Sillitoe, DH Lawrence and Lord Byron - all writers she respects. She admits she is \"a little bit obsessed\" with Byron and visits Newstead Abbey, the home he inherited, whenever she can. \"For me, [Hucknall] was a very small town. You just didn't meet transgender people. That wasn't going to happen. I think there was like one gay person,\" she says. \"Just going to Newstead Abbey, there was something really magical and beautiful about it, and feeling there was something quite sexy and controversial about Byron. \"That gave me something I could connect to that was local, that didn't fit in with that local mindset.\" Strangely, Paris thanked provocative writer Julie Burchill when she topped the Pink List earlier this month. Burchill was widely criticised for an Observer article in which she described \"trannies\" as \"a bunch of bed-wetters in bad wigs\" - a piece which Paris describes as \"pure transphobia\". \"I'm grateful to her for doing that because it was so bad that it put trans on the radar for a lot of people,\" says Paris. \"Julie Burchill, thank you for being awful.\" And ironically, Paris says negative media coverage about transgender teacher Lucy Meadows - who later killed herself - has also helped change attitudes. \"The response to Lucy Meadows was unprecedented,\" she says. \"People are starting to get it; it's on the agenda.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device More money than ever is flowing into the English domestic game, thanks to a £225m deal between the Rugby Football Union and Premiership clubs, and a bumper TV deal. As a result the salary cap has risen to £6.5m a year, while each club can also sign two 'marquee players' who do not count under the cap. With the new season starting on Friday, BBC Sport takes a closer look at some of the stellar new arrivals set to make an impact this year. South African flanker Burger is the most experienced of the new international stars arriving on England's shores, with 86 international caps under his belt. The 33-year-old, who won the World Cup with the Springboks in 2007, moves to champions Saracens after spells with Japanese outfit Suntory Sungoliath and Super Rugby side Stormers. Burger made his international debut for South Africa in 2003 and has featured in four World Cups. \"I've had a good career so far but you have two ways to look at it,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"One - you can try and slow down, try and limit the schedule and play a little bit less. I look at it the other way. \"I've got a couple of years maybe more left and I just want to challenge myself as much as possible.\" The Australia full-back, capped 60 times by his country, is one of the highest-profile signings in Premiership history. Beale, 27, is one of Wasps' marquee players with his salary - in excess of £500,000 a year - falling outside the salary cap. But Wasps fans will not see the former Waratahs star in action until at least November as he recovers from a serious knee injury. \"It's pretty frustrating coming in injured - not being able to do the things I am meant to do - but I guess when the opportunity comes I will be fighting fit and ready to go,\" Beale told BBC Radio 5 live. \"Obviously there is going to be a little bit of expectation and pressure. But I don't think it will be a huge problem for me because I really enjoy it when the pressure is on.\" France number eight Picamoles has made what has been an unusual move over the past few years, from France to England, while at his playing peak. The 30-year-old, who has 54 international caps and is noted as one of the finest ball carriers in the game, said he was looking forward to the quicker pace of the Premiership. \"Maybe it is more physical in France, but here all teams want to play a fast game, and this is good for my progression,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live. \"It's a big change for me and my family but we are enjoying starting a new life and adventure.\" The Wales international - foreign in that he is not English-qualified - may not have moved far in heading to the West Country from Newport, but Faletau's arrival at Bath was not without controversy after it was initially blocked last October by Wales coach Warren Gatland. The 25-year-old number eight's arrival at the Rec from Pro12 side Newport Gwent Dragons was eventually confirmed in December. Faletau, who already has 61 international caps, adds a wealth of experience and all-round talent to a Bath side under the stewardship of new director of rugby, Todd Blackadder. \"In my opinion [Faletau] is one of the best players in the world currently playing,\" Blackadder told BBC Radio Bristol. South Africa full-back Le Roux adds more international class to a Wasps side which will be looking to better its semi-final place in the last Premiership campaign. The 27-year-old, noted for his electric running from the back, will arrive at the Ricoh Arena in January once his spell in Japan with Canon Eagles finishes. Wasps director of rugby Dai Young has described him as one of the world's \"top two or three international full-backs\". Versatile Australia international Toomua's debut for the Tigers may have to wait a little longer than expected after the 26-year-old suffered concussion in the Wallabies' 42-8 defeat by New Zealand last month. Toomua, who can play at fly-half or inside centre (where he is most likely to feature for Leicester), has won 33 caps for his country since making his debut in 2013. He joins from Super 15 side Brumbies.

He said that particularly in developing countries this could include for-profit schools. Speaking at the Global Education and Skills Forum, Mr Blair said that when he was in office there had been a \"rhythm\" to the government's attempts to push through changes in education. \"When you first propose it, people tell you it's a terrible thing. When you're doing it, it's hell, and after you've done it, you wish you'd done more of it.\" Mr Blair told the education conference that he had found widespread support for the principle of education reform, but \"not when the reform comes to them\". He called for a greater range of groups to be involved in running schools and for greater use of technology. And he did not rule out the idea of using the private sector to run for-profit schools if they \"can come in and run schools effectively\". He said that the public sector is \"not good at innovating\" and would benefit from a more diverse range of partners to experiment with different ways of delivering education. \"Nothing should stand in the way\" of trying to improve schools, he said.

{"article": "A website inviting the British public to name the Â£200m ship had attracted huge interest, with Boaty McBoatface becoming the runaway favourite. However, it has now been announced that the vessel will be named the RRS Sir David Attenborough after the veteran British naturalist. This has sparked outrage, of sorts, on social media. Boaty McBoatface had proved to be a powerful force, spreading across the internet and sparking a number of imitations. A racehorse was saddled with the name Horsey McHorseface, in homage to Boaty, by trainer Bjorn Baker's team at Sydney's Warwick Farm racecourse in Australia. One fire service in England even had the nerve to suggest it had the idea first - though we suspect there is some Photoshop trickery going on here. Firefighters were quick to take to Twitter on Friday to point out they were not too happy to hear the latest news. This saga continues to cause waves around the world, with Australia recently announcing it was determined to avoid the Boaty McBoatface trap when it opened up the naming of a new icebreaker to the public vote. When leaders of a school in Austin, Texas, decided to ask members of the public to suggest a new name for their school, Boaty McBoatface received at least one vote. Other suggestions included Generic School Name, The Illuminati and Adolf Hitler School for Friendship and Tolerance. In the UK, people took to their keyboards to say the decision not to pick the name Boaty was anti-democratic. All this a day after British voters had gone to the polls in local elections. Oh, the irony. Some people came up with a creative solution to this nightmare, suggesting Sir David Attenborough himself bow down to public pressure. Someone even set up this change.org petition to be delivered to the BBC, demanding Sir David change his name.

{"article": "The distinctive synth sound chimes as the ethereal music of Clannad emanates from the TV: \"Robin, the hooded man\". It's a Saturday evening in the 1980s and time for a weekly fix of Robin of Sherwood. For many people of a certain age the ITV programme was a must-watch. Now, a new two-hour-long audio drama, featuring original cast members including Winstone, Connery, Mantle and Judi Trott has been made. The Knights Of the Apocalypse is based on an unused original script and was crowdfunded by fans of the series. So why is there still so much love for a show which only ran for three series between 1984 and 1986? Jason Connery, who played the hooded man in the final series, says it is because it is a \"universal story that generations can pass down\". \"Many fans come to me and say they watch the show with their kids, and in some ways, with it being period, it never ages, unlike us. \"The new audio play is a gift to the incredibly loyal fans who are very excited to have another story to listen to.\" The original script, which has been tweaked slightly for the audio play, was penned by the show's creator and writer, Richard \"Kip\" Carpenter, shortly after the third series ended. However, it was never filmed as the show's production company went bust and a fourth series was cancelled. Carpenter died in 2012 and profits from the new production will go to charities he supported. Winstone, who played Will Scarlet, says the TV show was \"a class bit of telly, shot beautifully\" and the storylines \"were great\". And the actor, who went on to become a Hollywood star, says it was a benchmark for his career. \"It was a chance to work with fine directors, crew and a group of actors who were second to none. \"Also the series was shot like a film. I learned a lot. \"I really enjoyed the day [in the recording studio], it brought back lots of great memories. Nothing's forgotten. Nothing's ever forgotten.\" The TV series was filmed in various locations, including Wiltshire, Somerset and Northumberland. All surviving members of the main cast took part in the new recording. Even Michael Praed, who played Robin in the first and second series, features as a \"spectral voice\". Trott, who played Lady Marian, says there was \"nothing quite like it on the telly\" back in the 1980s. \"It was a magical combination of historical heritage mixed with folklore and action that appealed to both men and women, teenagers and kids. \"I hope the new audio drama will bring back many happy memories for the people who listen to it. \"It was a real treat and honour to be part of it and work again with so many of the original cast. It was like slipping back in time.\" Similarly, Mantle, who played Little John, says he was \"lucky and privileged\" to be involved in a \"classic for a generation\". \"In fact it was so well made, it has gently spilled over to subsequent generations and that causes great pride and pleasure to all of us involved in the production. It had huge heart at its centre. \"I hope it will sound amazing. I am looking forward to hearing it. As soon as Clannad's theme kicks in we will be in safe hands.\" The cancellation of the fourth series left a number of loose ends in the plot. \"When it went it did leave people wanting more, and to be able to bring it back for people to enjoy and perhaps get some answers as to what happened after that unresolved series three ending, is all the motivation you need,\" says Gloucester-based producer Barnaby Eaton-Jones. \"The production was fully crowdfunded within 24 hours which tells you something about the passion felt for this show.\" The Knights Of The Apocalypse is available as a digital download and on CD from 30 June.", "question": "After a gap of three decades , the cult TV series Robin of Sherwood has made a comeback , in the form of an audio play .

{"article": "Today could be just another day he may have felt the same, as events moved with dizzying speed. First, it was the news that the government had reassigned 350 police officers in the capital Ankara to different posts (mostly demotions) by a government decree published at midnight. They included chiefs of financial crimes, anti-smuggling, cybercrime and organised crime units. This was followed by other breaking news - a simultaneous corruption operation in five cities across Turkey, with more than 25 people, businessmen and state officials, detained on suspicion of bribery and fraudulent tenders. Then the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK), which appoints senior members of the judiciary, decided to investigate Istanbul's newly appointed police chief and several prosecutors overseeing the corruption probe started in December last year. Later, the top police officers in charge of the operation conducted earlier in the day were dismissed from their posts. An opposition MP called for the president to intervene in the crisis. A former Turkish president had once famously said \"24 hours is a very long time in politics\". Even he probably could not have predicted such a day. All these moves come as the AKP government led by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan tries to contain the massive political fallout from the corruption probe into four government ministers, several businessmen and bankers. This has become the biggest challenge to the AKP government's 11-year rule and Mr Erdogan has been quick to retaliate, condemning the probe as a \"dirty plot\" to topple his government. Mr Erdogan said he would not permit \"a state within a state\", a phrase apparently referring to the movement led by the highly influential Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999. Mr Gulen is said to have millions of followers across the world and extensive influence over the state bureaucracy, the police force and the judiciary in Turkey. The government accuses him and his movement, referred to as \"Cemaat\" in Turkey, of being behind the graft probe - a charge Mr Gulen denies. However, the recent crisis in Turkey is increasingly seen as not only a corruption investigation which is alleged to involve the closest circles of Mr Erdogan, but a bitter power struggle between AKP and Cemaat. Some believe that Cemaat's support was crucial in the election victories of AKP for three consecutive terms; that they have helped the government in curbing the powers of the military by their influence within the judiciary with the help of high-profile cases like Ergenekon and Sledgehammer which saw hundreds of military officers - including the previous chief of staff of the armed forces - jailed; that as the \"common enemy\" was driven out of the picture they started to become wary of each other's power and hence a fight for holding the ropes of Turkey started. Many commentators in Turkey label the recent fallout as a \"state crisis\" since the government is perceived to be intervening in the judiciary, and the principle of separation of powers does not seem to be as intact as it should in a democracy. On the other hand, Cemaat is not a transparent movement; no-one knows the extent of its financial power, how many millions of followers it has, how influential it is in key offices within Turkish state and what would happen if it gained further influence. Neither does anyone know who might win this full-scale battle: Mr Erdogan or Mr Gulen. Supporters of both sides accuse each other of undermining democracy and the rule of law; the media has become increasingly polarised with either pro-Erdogan or pro-Gulen voices leaving little space for others and the Turkish public increasingly feeling as if they are watching a fierce tennis match, holding their breaths. Recently, it was alleged that there could be detente between Mr Erdogan and Mr Gulen through a letter Mr Gulen sent to the president of the country. But that option does not seem to be on the table any more. Now there is speculation that there might soon be an investigation into Cemaat, with accusations it is a \"terrorist organisation\". On the other hand there is a possibility that people affiliated to Cemaat could leak new allegations involving influential people close to the government.

Lord Chancellor and justice minister Liz Truss said she was \"delighted\" that Lord Neuberger was \"proactively talking about the role of the judiciary in public.\" She added: \"It is right that everyone understands the importance of its independence and the rule of law in a free society.\" Lord Neuberger, who retires in September, was speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme a month after the Supreme Court ruled that only Parliament, not ministers, had the power to trigger the UK's exit from the EU because that was where laws were made. The Daily Mail's front page story was published when the government lost the first stage of the legal battle at the High Court last November. That story sparked a furious row with critics, including MPs from all parties, accusing Liz Truss, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, of not standing up for an independent judiciary. The Supreme Court, the final court of appeal in the UK for civil cases - and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland - hears cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance affecting the whole population. Its justices also sit as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and as such will occasionally hear appeals against the death penalty from Commonwealth countries. In an average year, the Supreme Court hears about 90 appeals and makes about 80 judgements on important issues of law. In his interview, Lord Neuberger did not single out any newspaper or politician, but said: \"We [judges in general] were certainly not well treated. One has to be careful about being critical of the press particularly as a lawyer or judge because our view of life is very different from that of the media. \"I think some of what was said was undermining the rule of law.\" Asked whether politicians had responded quickly enough to defend the judiciary and rule of law, Lord Neuberger said: \"They were certainly vocal enough quickly enough after our hearing [in the Supreme Court]. \"After the [High] Court hearing. I think they could have been quicker and clearer.  But we all learn by experience, whether politicians or judges. It's easy to be critical after the event. They were faced with an unexpected situation from which like all sensible people they learned.\" Lord Neuberger said that undermining the judiciary also undermined the rule of law as judges were \"the ultimate guardians\" of it. \"The rule of law together with democracy is one of the two pillars on which our society is based,\" he added. \"And therefore if, without good reason, the media or anyone else undermines the judiciary that risks undermining our society. \"The press and the media generally have a positive duty to keep an eye on things. But I think with that power comes the degree of responsibility.\" By Clive Coleman, BBC Legal correspondent The country's judges were stung and hurt by the description of three of the most senior members of their ranks as 'enemies of the people'. As a body they feel they cannot respond to such criticism publicly - judges must after all speak through their judgements alone, and the occasional public lecture. Being dragged into the forum of public debate is seen as something that diminishes public confidence in their independence. Whilst some senior retired judges such as the former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge did speak out after the press coverage of the High Court Article 50 ruling, Lord Neuberger is the most senior serving judge to do so publicly. He retires in September so perhaps he feels that the reins are off, or at least loosened. His fellow judges will be quietly delighted that he has expressed his views on what they saw as an unfair attack on their independence and the rule of lawâ€¦ but they won't say that publicly. Kelvin MacKenzie, a former editor of the Sun, told the BBC Lord Neuberger was being \"overly sensitive\" and said judges \"cannot sit above argument or above criticism\". \"[Newspapers] certainly haven't undermined the rule of law,\" he said. \"They have simply added to a debate going on outside the legal entity called the Supreme Court and there is nothing wrong with that. We call that free speech. \"Surely he is not indicating that free speech should have a limit in relation to the Supreme Court and a judgement [over Brexit] which had an enormous impact on a number of people? It is quite wrong.\" The interview with Lord Neuberger comes on the same day the Supreme Court begins taking applications for new justices. As well as a new president to replace him, there is the need for two further justices after the retirement of Lord Toulson in 2016, and the upcoming retirement of Lord Clarke. The current bench is made up of one woman and 10 men, all white and from affluent backgrounds. On announcing his retirement last year, Lord Neuberger called for a diverse list of candidates to take the jobs. \"The higher echelons of the judiciary in the United Kingdom suffer from a marked lack of diversity and here I must admit the Supreme Court does not score at all well,\" he said. \"We have one white woman and 10 white men, and, although two of the 11 were not privately educated, none of us come from disadvantaged backgrounds.\" Ms Truss welcomed the comments. She said: \"I am pleased to see him encouraging the widest pool of talent for the recruitment of three Supreme Court judges, which will enhance and strengthen our outstanding judiciary.\" Applications will close on 10 March. There will then be shortlisting, interviews and consultation exercises, with the names of the new appointments expected to be announced in July. They will take up office at the beginning of the new legal year in October. Three more justices - Lord Mance, Lord Hughes and Lord Sumption - will retire before the end of 2018, as the statutory retirement age for judges is 70.

{"article": "Crowdfunding - asking lots of people to each donate a small sum of money online - has been around since the 1990s, when fans of cult rock bands got together to fund new albums and tours for their idols. The sites are now used by a vast array of different fundraisers. Currently, £25 might buy you a lamb for an Indian village, de-worming tablets for 500 children, or a ukulele. On former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's website, though, it'll buy 1000 A4 leaflets for his election campaign.  He is not alone. Sites like GoFundMe, Crowdfunder and Crowdpac are brimming with politicians. Crowdfunder says that in the week since the UK election was called, more than £200,000 was raised for political projects on its site. It is expecting a 50% increase in the number of candidates using crowdfunding compared to 2015. Conservatives in Wirral South, UKIP candidate Phil Eckersley and sitting Labour MPs like Peter Kyle, Maria Eagle and Rachel Reeves are among those turning to the technique. There is nothing new about politicians raising money online - but the snap election has left them very little time to raise money through traditional methods, forcing them to get creative. Lib Dem Stephen Lloyd, who is trying to regain the Eastbourne seat he lost to Conservative Caroline Ansell in 2015, said: \"Where you have more time, I have fundraising dinners, I've gone to more quizzes and raffles and tombolas than you could shake a stick at. \"I instantly realised I didn't have time to do ten fundraisers over the next month.\" The internet offered an answer. He set up a page on his website asking for donations, and shared it on Facebook. Within a week, 551 donors had raised over £16,000. He says the response touched him. \"The truth of it is I could almost cry. When I've gone out and asked people, they've stepped up. It makes me feel like I'm part of something.\" Businesswoman Gina Miller has crowdfunded over £300,000 to organise tactical voting and support up to 100 candidates opposed to a \"hard Brexit\". That's alongside numerous pages for SNP and Green candidates. There's even someone calling themselves \"Mr Fish Finger\" raising money to stand against Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. Anyone who wants to take part in the election has to stump up a £500 deposit. Green MEP Molly Scott Cato is hoping to become an MP in Bristol West. Both she and her party have crowdfunding pages. \"Greens have been using this model for a number of years. To be honest, it wasn't that we preferred it - it was our only choice. We're not a very well-funded party and so candidates needed to get hold of enough funds to put up for the deposit.\" But isn't it a bit odd to ask the public to fork out even more for the election? After all, June's poll will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds to administer. Molly Scott Cato disagrees. \"It's a democratic approach. It allows everybody to support the party with their money, and later on support it with their vote as well, hopefully. \"It's a way of people making obvious their investment in the campaign and their commitment to a Green candidate.\" Up and down the country, politicians are turning to you, the public, for help with their campaigning costs. But they need to be careful. The Electoral Commission regulates election spending and political donations. It says candidates must collect enough information from donors to be able to check they are allowed to accept their cash. In a statement, the elections watchdog said: \"When crowdfunding, campaigners must only accept donations over a certain value from a permissible source. \"For candidates that means donations exceeding £50, for political parties and non-party campaigners it is £500. \"Candidates, parties and non-party campaigners can only accept donations from permissible, mainly UK sources. \"They must therefore collect information from every donor to ensure that they can properly check that each donation is from a permissible source. If a donation is not from a permissible source, it must be returned within 30 days.\" So while it's an effective way of raising cash quickly,  if you're crowdfunding, make sure you're keeping tabs on who's donating.", "question": "It is the favourite money - raising tool for crazy @placeholder and passion projects , as well as more worthy causes - and now would - be MPs are getting on board .", "option_0": "dreams", "option_1": "food", "option_2": "health", "option_3": "rules", "option_4": "schools", "label": 0}

{"article": "Steven Green, 43, from Kirkliston, and Alan D'Ambrosio, 51, from Edinburgh, were convicted of assault, robbery, abduction and attempted extortion at a farm at Philpstoun on 25 April 2014. The 55-year-old victim was beaten up, trussed, hooded and forced into a van. He told the High Court in Edinburgh he thought he was going to die. The victim was targeted in an attempted extortion after he had negotiated to buy a company from former bank manager Green, but the money had not yet been paid. A judge told the pair at the High Court in Edinburgh: \"The use of violence in business dealings has to be suppressed by appropriate punishment being meted out to those who engage in it.\" Lord Uist told them it was a \"deplorable\" incident of criminality and lawlessness. He said neither had shown shame or remorse and continued to deny their guilt in the face of compelling evidence. Green ran venture capital firm Pentland Capital and held an interest in Glencairn Risk Solutions - which was co-owned by D'Ambrosio. Both men had denied assaulting, abducting and attempting to extort money from the victim on 25 April 2014 at West Philpstoun Steadings, Philpstoun. However, the pair were convicted of committing the crime while acting with others unknown by a jury last month and remanded in custody ahead of sentencing. During the attack the victim was repeatedly hit on the head with a weapon and had bleach poured on him. He was robbed of a wallet, phone and car keys and threatened with violence if money was not paid to Green within seven days. The attack victim estimated he was hit 30 to 40 times. Defence counsel Keith Stewart, for Green, said a series of testimonials produced on his behalf were \"remarkable\" and reflected his conduct in business, family life, his faith and the help he had given others including through charity work in Africa.

{"article": "Shaw was chopped down by Hector Moreno before being carried off early on. After a long delay, Memphis Depay scored a weaving opener on his return to PSV, but in first-half injury time Moreno headed in from a corner. PSV's Luciano Narsingh headed in a 57th-minute winner despite United dominating for long periods. Unlike previous games this season where Louis van Gaal's side have struggled to turn their superiority into chances, they chalked up 17 shots on goal to PSV's six. There were encouraging displays from Depay, who scored his third of the season, and Anthony Martial, who made his full debut following his wonder goal during the win over Liverpool last Saturday. Poor finishing let the visitors down, although their biggest concern will be over Shaw who will now suffer a lengthy lay-off. United started the game well but after 15 minutes they were rocked by the injury to Shaw, who has made a positive start to his second season at Old Trafford. The England full-back burst into the box after riding two challenges, but as he bore down on goal he was scythed down by Moreno and from the Mexico defender's immediate reaction, it was clear that the injury to Shaw was serious. Replays showed that his right leg appeared to be broken and after 10 minutes of treatment the 20-year-old was taken off on a stretcher to sympathetic applause from the PSV fans. There was no punishment for Moreno, who equalised in first-half stoppage time. With a lengthy absence to come, left-back Shaw's inclusion in the England squad at Euro 2016 must be in some doubt. Depay may not have scored in the Premier League so far, but fresh from his £31m move from PSV to Manchester United in June, the 21-year-old looked at home on his return to the Philips Stadium. The forward, who scored 22 league goals for PSV en route to the Eredivisie title last season, started down the left and linked up well with striker Martial, who showed no signs of nervousness despite his tender age of 19 and his £36m transfer fee. Depay's goal was not dissimilar to Martial's effort at Old Trafford against Liverpool. Played through by Daley Blind, he cut inside, and beat Jeroen Zoet with some ease. When the scores were level, the Dutchman could have added to his tally after a smart one-two with Martial but struck straight at the PSV goalkeeper. In addition to their profligacy in front of goal, United were also guilty of contributing to both PSV goals. The first, which came from Moreno's header, bounced off Blind's head and wrong-footed Ashley Young, who was well placed to stop the initial effort on the goalline. The second was well taken by Narsingh, who headed in a delightful left-wing cross by Maxime Lestienne, but Matteo Darmian was guilty of giving the ball away in his own half. There was plenty of time to recover, and Depay had several chances to double his tally despite switching onto the right side during the second half. Juan Mata was perhaps guilty of the worst miss by failing to control a chipped ball by Bastian Schweinsteiger. There was plenty of encouragement for Van Gaal's side, who will face Wolfsburg at Old Trafford on 30 September before travelling to CSKA Moscow on 21 October, and Martial gave them added power and pace up front. But they will be disappointed not to have earned at least a point on their return to the Champions League after a year's absence. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal: \"It's the same game as against Swansea. We are dominating the game, we are creating chances and we are not finishing. The first chance they have, the corner kick, they scored. \"The second goal, we were attacking and then we lose the ball in the first phase and they scored.

{"article": "The New York businessman-turned-politician said many controversial things and flip-flopped on a number of policy positions during the campaign. Here, we look back at 24 of his professed beliefs. 1. The US should use waterboarding This and other methods of \"strong interrogation\" should be deployed in its fight against the Islamic State group. These methods, Mr Trump said, are \"peanuts\" compared to the tactics used by the militants, such as beheadings. \"I like it a lot. I don't think it's tough enough,\" he said in June of the banned practice. 2. Mexico should pay for the \"great, great wall\" Mr Trump has said he wants to start building the much-touted wall on the shared border from the first day of his presidency, and that Mexico will pay for it. In some of his earliest campaign comments, he suggested that Mexicans coming to the US were criminals and \"rapists\".  BBC analysis estimates the border wall could cost between $2.2bn and $13bn. 3. Muslims should not be admitted to the US In the wake of the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, Mr Trump wrote that he was \"calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on\". He's since gone back on the announcement, instead saying that that he would temporarily suspend \"immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\". 4. Arab-Americans cheered the attacks on 9/11 Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that on 11 September 2001, there were thousands of Arab-Americans celebrating in New Jersey after two planes flew into the Twin Towers. He says such public demonstrations \"tell you something\" about Muslims living in the US. However, there are no media reports to back up the claim. 5. Obamacare is a \"disaster\". Mr Trump says he wants Congress to fully repeal the president's Affordable Care Act, which aims at extending the number of Americans with health insurance, but he believes that \"everybody's got to be covered\". A spokesman for Mr Trump said he would propose \"a health plan that will return authority to the states and operate under free market principles\". The increase in premiums revealed just before the election bolstered the Trump attacks. 6. Climate change is just \"weather\" While Mr Trump believes that maintaining \"clean air\" and \"clean water\" is important, he has dismissed climate change science as a \"hoax\" and believes environmental restrictions on businesses make them less competitive in the global marketplace. \"I do not believe that we should imperil the companies within our country,\" he told CNN on the issue. \"It costs so much and nobody knows exactly if it's going to work.\" 7. The world would be better off if Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi were still in power Mr Trump told CNN that he believes the situation in both Libya and Iraq is \"far worse\" than it ever was under the leaders of the two countries. While he concedes Saddam was a \"horrible guy\", he says he did a better job combating terrorists. 8. Illegal migrants should be deported Trump once said that he wanted to deport all of the approximately 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the US, despite criticism that this idea is both xenophobic, next to impossible and prohibitively expensive - the BBC estimates a cost of $114bn. His official policy now says only those with criminal records will be deported immediately, although immigration controls will still be massively beefed up. Any undocumented migrants would also face the risk of deportation. 9. Syrian refugees could be a \"Trojan horse\" He says that the Paris attacks prove that even a handful of terrorists posing as migrants could do catastrophic damage, and so he will oppose resettling any Syrians in the US, and deport those who have already been resettled. It's unclear if he still believes that deportations are necessary, though he has still vowed to suspend the intake of Syrian refugees. 10. Vladimir Putin is a \"leader\" He has noted the Russian president's \"great control over his country\" and criticised the state of the relations between it and the US. He told CNN: \"I would probably get along with him very well. And I don't think you'd be having the kind of problems that you're having right now\". More recently he has said that Mr Putin doesn't \"respect\" the US, although that was no reason to get tough on him. 11. Taxes should be reduced for everyone Trump wants to condense the current seven tax brackets to just three, with no income tax for \"low-income Americans\". He would lower the business tax to 15%, from 35%. He would also allow multinational companies keeping profits overseas to repatriate their cash at a 10% tax rate. 12. Hedge fund managers are \"getting away with murder\" Mr Trump found common ground with Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren when he said that hedge fund managers and the ultra-wealthy did not pay enough taxes. However, after the campaign released specifics of his plan, analysts argued that hedge fund managers would actually get a tax cut along with the middle class. 13. China should be taken to task on a number of trade-related issues He has said he will make China stop undervaluing its currency, and force it to step up its environmental and labour standards. He is also critical of the county's lax attitude towards American intellectual property and hacking. 14. The Black Lives Matter movement is \"trouble\" Mr Trump mocked former Democratic candidates like Martin O'Malley for apologising to members of the protest movement against police brutality and cast himself as a pro-law enforcement candidate. \"I think they're looking for trouble,\" he once said of the activist group. He also tweeted a controversial and widely debunked graphic purporting to show that African Americans kill white and black people at far higher rates than white people or police officers. 15. He's worth $10bn Based on Mr Trump's 92-page personal financial disclosure form, Bloomberg calculated last year that the real estate mogul was worth about $2.9bn, while Forbes recently put Trump's net worth at $3.7bn. Mr Trump has however insisted that he is worth \"in excess\" of $10bn. 16. Veteran healthcare in the US needs a major overhaul Mr Trump wants to clear out the executive level in the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying that waiting times for doctor visits have only increased after previous interventions failed. Thousands of veterans have died while waiting for care, he says. He will invest in the treatment of \"invisible wounds\" like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. He would also increase the number of doctors who specialise in women's health to help care for the increasing number of female veterans. 17. Lobbyists should be more restricted Mr Trump proposes that there be a five-year ban that prevents government officials and members of congress from leaving and then immediately becoming lobbyists. He also calls for a lifetime ban on senior administration officials from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. 18. He is a \"really nice guy\" In Trump's most recent book, Crippled America, he writes that \"I'm a really nice guy, believe me, I pride myself on being a nice guy but I'm also passionate and determined to make our country great again\". The news site Gawker points out that he calls himself a \"nice guy\" throughout the book, and Mr Trump repeated that self-assessment in his opening monologue on Saturday Night Live and in an interview with the Washington Post. 19. He could not have groped an unattractive woman A video from 2005 showed Mr Trump making obscene comments about women and triggered numerous claims of alleged sexual harassment. At one rally, he suggested that one of the accusers - a \"horrible woman\" - was not attractive enough for him to have groped: \"I don't think so! I don't think so!\" 20. Tokyo and Seoul should build up nuclear arsenals He has said Japan and South Korea should not rely on the US so much and would benefit from having their own weapons. Nuclear war between Japan and North Korea may be \"terrible\" but it would be \"pretty quick\". 21. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) is a \"rip-off\" Why? Because the US pays more than anyone else. But he later said he was \"all\" in favour of the alliance. 22. Doctors should be punished for administering abortions Or should they? In an interview with MSNBC, Mr Trump said that if abortion were to become illegal, women should be punished for obtaining them. He then retracted, saying the doctor would be responsible and he or she should be punished, instead. 23. The Republican National Committee's rules were \"stacked against him\" He called the delegate system \"crooked\" and \"unfair\". He repeatedly clashed with the RNC over its nomination process and how it treated his candidacy during the primaries. He called rules that allowed Senator Ted Cruz to gain more delegates than him in some states \"rigged\", as he did later when talking about the electoral process when polls were showing Hillary Clinton ahead of him. 24. The federal minimum wage should be raised Workers should be paid more than the current level of $7.25/hour, he has said. though this is another issue he has flip-flopped on repeatedly.

Despite that, Cameroon's Hayatou - who had been Fifa's acting president in the lead-up to the election - sent Infantino a letter, dated 27 February 2016, congratulating him on behalf of the Caf Executive committee and 'the African football family': \"Be assured of the continued support of Caf, African members of the new Fifa Council, as well as our commitment to strengthening the excellent relationship between Caf and Fifa,\" Hayatou wrote. After his victory, Infantino promised to restore the image of Fifa, and Hayatou backed him to fulfil his pledge. \"We are confident that you will restore Fifa's image backed by your career, skills, passion for football, understanding of the issues related to the future of football, and your desire to develop our sport around the four corners of the world,\" said the Caf President. With 54 member African confederations able to vote in the presidential election - more than any other Fifa region - Caf's support for Sheikh Salman installed the Bahranian as a favourite to win.

{"article": "Tony Tyler called for drone regulations to be put in place before any serious accidents occur. He said the threat posed by unmanned aerial vehicles is still evolving. \"I am as excited as you are about the prospect of having pizza delivered by a drone,\" he told a conference in Singapore. \"But we cannot allow [drones] to be a hindrance or safety threat to commercial aviation,\" said Mr Tyler, director-general of the International Air Transport Association. \"The issue is real. We have plenty of pilot reports of drones where they were not expected, particularly at low altitudes around airports,\" he added. \"There is no denying that there is a real and growing threat to the safety of civilian aircraft [coming from drones]. \"We need a sensible approach to regulation and a pragmatic method of enforcement for those who disregard rules and regulations and put others in danger.\" Drones were recently involved in four serious near-misses at UK airports, the UK Air Proximity Board said in January. The board, which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace, said a drone had come very close to colliding with a Boeing 737 that had taken off from Stansted airport. IATA's primary concern is drones flying at low altitudes near airports that could threaten planes taking off or landing, Rob Eagles of Iata said. Aviation regulators also want to make sure that the radio spectrum used to control the drones does not interfere with air traffic control systems, he said. In December the US government set up a registration system for Americans who own drones. Anyone who has a drone must register with the Federal Aviation Administration before the device takes its first flight. Owners have until Friday to register their details or face being fined.

Mr Trump caused a furore last month after he said Mexican immigrants who came to the US brought drugs and crime. Ms Vega called Mr Trump's comments \"unjust and hurtful\", but said she would continue as Miss Universe. \"The fact that I am not giving up my crown doesn't mean I am changing my stance about everything I said,\" Ms Vega told local radio on Monday, adding that the Miss Universe organisation did meaningful social work. \"I have kept doing my job as Miss Universe all these days. The work continues as always despite all this craziness going on,\" she added. Mr Trump had attacked Ms Vega for keeping her crown, saying: \"Miss Universe, Paulina Vega, criticised me for telling the truth about illegal immigration, but then said she would keep the crown - hypocrite.\" While announcing his candidacy for the US presidency last month, Mr Trump had accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals to the United States. He also pledged to build a \"great wall\" on the US border with Mexico and insisted it would be paid for by Mexicans. He later insisted he was criticising US lawmakers, not Mexican people. Following Mr Trump's remarks, several TV networks across the Americas said they would no longer air Miss Universe, including the Spanish language network, Univision and NBC.

{"article": "Western powers are now becoming increasingly concerned that so-called Islamic State (IS) has built a presence in the North African state and the US has responded by launching air strikes on the militant group. Only Libya's myriad armed militias really wield power - and it is felt they often hold the politicians they supposedly back to ransom. During the uprising, anyone with a gun could command respect, and lots of armed groups emerged - up to 1,700, according to some estimates. There are two rival parliaments and three governments - the latest government was formed in UN-brokered talks with the aim of replacing the other two. But this initiative is still on the rocks, partly because of concerns that the new government is being imposed by Western powers. The oil-rich country once had one of the highest standards of living in Africa, with free healthcare and free education, but six years on from the uprising, it is facing a financial crisis. This turmoil has allowed IS to gain a foothold in the country. Top IS leaders 'take refuge' in Libya IS had taken control of an \"enclave\" in and around the city of Sirte, the birthplace of Gaddafi. Security experts feared this could provide a safe haven for jihadists to train, fund and plan attacks in North Africa and across the Mediterranean. However, pro-government forces backed by the West have now pushed back the Islamists and retaken the city. Some security analysts describe Libya as an arms bazaar. It is awash with weapons looted from Gaddafi's arsenal - making an ideal playground for jihadists fleeing air strikes in Syria and Iraq. IS has been attacking Libyan oil facilities, has kidnapped several foreign oil workers and in 2015 was behind two high-profile attacks on Tunisia's tourism industry - carried out by gunmen trained in Libya. Tunisia has built a partial security barrier and trench along its border with Libya aimed at preventing further atrocities. Beheadings and racial tension: Life under Islamic State How IS's Libya foothold threatens UK The Libyans gaining ground on IS The US has carried out at least four known air strikes in Libya since 2015. The latest one, in January, targeted an alleged training camp on the outskirts of Sirte where some IS militants had fled after the city fell. The UK and France also have special forces operating in the North African state - the nature and extent of these operations have largely been secretive. Three French soldiers died in July 2016 when their helicopter was shot down by militiamen who identified themselves as belonging to a new militant group called Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB). Last year, plans were unveiled to send 6,000 troops from a number of Nato countries, including the UK and France, to Libya to train local troops to stop IS-linked groups from gaining more territory and to provide security to diplomatic missions that were looking to move back to the capital. However, the new unity government was reluctant to openly allow or request such a presence and the plan has still not materialised. Former US President Barack Obama, in an interview published in April 2016, said that the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency was the failure to prepare for the aftermath of Col Gaddafi's overthrow. He partly blamed then-UK Prime Minister David Cameron for \"the mess\", saying he had not done enough to support the North African nation whose instability was threatening its neighbours and was a factor in Europe's migrant crisis. Parliamentary elections held in 2014 were disputed. Those who held power refused to give it up and remained in the capital, Tripoli. The newly elected parliament then moved to the port of Tobruk, 1,000km (620 miles) away and set up a rival government. This parliament still has the official backing of the UN as Libya's official legislative body - despite the fact that it is opposed to the new unity administration. It wants Gen Khalifa Haftar, who is leading the battle against Islamist militias, to keep a senior role in a future army, something the UN agreement does not guarantee. The UN-mediated deal for a unity government has seen the formation of a nine-member Presidency Council, led by Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj. He arrived in Tripoli in March 2016 to set up his administration and has been trying to win the support of the various militias and politicians, but it has little real power over the whole country. The council has also suffered from divisions. Two members boycotted it continuously, eventually moving to the east, while another member resigned. Mr Sarraj, an engineer by profession, approved the 1 August 2016 US air strike on suspected IS positions in Sirte, in the first co-ordinated military action between his government and the US. Has Libya pulled back from the brink? They were united in their hatred for Gaddafi - but nothing more. There was no single group in charge of the rebellion. Militias were based in different cities, fighting their own battles. They are also ideologically divided - some of them are militant or moderate Islamists, others are secessionists or monarchists and yet others are liberals. Furthermore, the militias are split along regional, ethnic and local lines, making it a combustible mix. And after more than four decades of authoritarian rule, they had little understanding of democracy. So they were unable to forge compromises and build a new state based on the rule of law. My search for Gaddafi's golden gun East and central: West: Guide to Libya's militias Profile: Khalifa Haftar Rogue general divides Libyans Oil production almost ground to a halt for more than two years but has recovered a little in recent months. This happened after a siege was lifted by LNA forces when they took over the main oil fields in central Libya and expelled a rival armed group led by Ibrahim Jathran. Banks are still strapped for cash, however, and there is little foreign currency available officially. The black market exchange rate has sky-rocketed in recent months, and food prices have risen.  Hospitals are in short supply of medicine.

{"article": "The Boston Protest Group said the \"peaceful demonstration\" was aimed at highlighting the pressure put on local services by migrant workers. About 300 people gathered at the Herbert Ingram memorial for the demonstration, which organisers said was not aimed at individuals. An estimated 9,000 foreign workers have settled in the town in recent years. By Scott DaltonBBC Radio Lincolnshire reporter In the shadow of Boston Stump with the statue of the town's former MP Herbert Ingram as a backdrop, scores of people both young and old gathered for the protest. They held banners ranging from \"Free Us From The Shackles of Europe\" to \"Get Back Our Country\". Many told me they felt it was a chance for them to finally air their views in public after feeling they had been ignored too long by politicians. There were impromptu speeches on a loudspeaker from some of the crowd, while organisers stressed their beef was not with migrants themselves but with the immigration policies of successive governments. At one point there was even a good-natured conversation between a demonstrator and a Polish man who made the point he always worked hard himself but sympathised with the protesters and wished them well. Protest organiser Dean Everitt said: \"We had a good turnout of people, the right people, and we put our point across peacefully. \"I hope national government are going to know what we've done - we'll take it to Westminster until we get this issue sorted out.\" He added: \"We've proved a point - we're not right-wing thugs, we're not racists, we're just everyday people that are fed up and sick to the back teeth of migration. \"I work with Polish people and even they've said there are far too many here now.\" But migrant worker Martins Zagers said some English people were not prepared to work in local factories because \"it was a hard job\". \"I work in a factory where there are only Polish, Latvian and Lithuanians,\" he said. \"From my side I am working hard and I will not take benefits - I am too proud to take benefits.\" A protest march planned for last year was cancelled after the borough council agreed to set up a task force. A report on population change was published as a result, but campaigners said it had not gone \"far enough\" and government still needed to listen. The Home Office said it was working to cut net migration from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament and its tough new rules were already taking effect.

{"article": "China's President Xi Jinping has pledged $124bn (Â£96bn) for the scheme, known as the Belt and Road initiative. \"Trade is the important engine of economic development,\" Mr Xi said at a summit of world leaders in Beijing. The plan, which aims to expand trade links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond, was first unveiled in 2013. Part of the massive funding boost, which is aimed at strengthening China's links with its trading partners, includes 60bn yuan ($9bn; Â£7bn) in aid to developing countries and international institutions that form part of the Belt and Road project. Mr Xi used his speech to assure Western diplomats that the plan, described as the new Silk Road, was not simply an attempt to promote Chinese influence globally. \"In advancing the Belt and Road, we will not re-tread the old path of games between foes. Instead we will create a new model of co-operation and mutual benefit,\" Mr Xi said at the opening of the two-day summit. \"We should build an open platform of co-operation and uphold and grow an open world economy,\" he added. A Chinese idea but for everyone's benefit. That's how Mr Xi presented his Belt and Road vision to drive trade and prosperity through Chinese built infrastructure. President Putin of Russia and President Erdogan of Turkey were among those applauding from the front row as the Chinese leader talked of a big family of harmonious co-existence and pledged billions of dollars in loans and investment. But neighbours Japan and India have stayed away from the summit, suspicious that China's development agenda masks a bid for strategic assets and geopolitical ambitions. And some economists are cautious about the viability of projects in areas of political instability and poor governance. In his keynote address on Sunday, Mr Xi ignored the doubters. He talked of a new model of win-win co-operation, an implicit bid for Chinese global leadership at a time when other big economic powers like the United States and the European Union are preoccupied with internal problems. Read more: China's big push for its global trade narrative Mr Xi said that it was time for the world to promote open development and encourage the building of systems of \"fair, reasonable and transparent global trade and investment rules\". \"China is willing to share its development experience with all countries. We will not interfere in other countries' internal affairs,\" he said. \"No matter if they are from Asia and Europe, or Africa or the Americas, they are all co-operative partners in building the Belt and Road.\" What is China's new Silk Road? Mr Xi did not give a timeframe for the distribution of funds pledged for the projects outlined on Sunday.

{"article": "But a Belfast community organisation is trying to restore respectability to the opinion polls with a novel idea. The Lagan Village Youth and Community Group, just off the city's Ravenhill Road, is installing bright yellow cigarette bins with a twist in a bid to predict the outcome of the Northern Ireland Assembly election. People will vote with their butts by slipping their smokes into one of two slots, choosing between the DUP and Sinn Féin. George Newell from the centre said the ballot-style bins would do their bit for the environment as well as getting people to think about politics. \"Instead of people throwing their cigarette ends on to the street, these butt bins will encourage people to dispense of them in a safe, environmental manner,\" he said. \"The idea behind these ones is to make a statement with your butt. \"So, we've put a sign on them - who will be the biggest party after the assembly election; will it be the DUP or Sinn Féin?\" And George believes this could spark a new forecasting \"trend\". On 3 March, there'll be no ifs, just butts - the bins will be emptied and the cigarettes counted to see if the tobacco-based total matches the election outcome. But George has already got an idea who will win the battle of Lagan Village. \"Knowing this locality, I don't think the DUP has much of a problem.\" It's the dogs that are the danger on the campaign trail in South Down, as one candidate found out on Wednesday. And Sinn Féin's Barry McElduff has said that life's no different west of the River Bann. Whether it's an Alsatian or a Yorkshire terrier, hounds pose one of the \"perennial challenges\" faced by canvassers, particularly in country areas. \"As a canvasser, you've got to try and find out: Will that dog bite you?\" he explained. \"Wee dogs, big dogs - they always say the wee terriers are the worst.\" For canvassers who come up against a barking dog that's bearing its teeth, our handy tip for those knocking on the doors is to slip it a slice of ham - that'll guarantee you get its vote! Welfare reform sparked a crisis at Stormont a couple of years ago when the executive parties couldn't agree on their own package of mitigation changes in line with the reforms that were coming into effect in the rest of the UK.

Entitled is being performed across Northern Ireland until Saturday 25 February, and it looks at the impact of the controversial phasing out of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to Personal Independence Payments, as well as people's use of food banks. Scriptwriter Fionnuala Kennedy said that when researching for the play she was struck by how many people were unaware of the looming changes to their benefits. \"We interviewed people who were on benefits as research for the play and they were saying: 'I'm on DLA and I was told it was for life, so welfare reform doesn't apply.' \"And we had to tell them, as artists in the room: 'No it does.' \"Then they were asking us for help with benefit forms - that was really worrying.\" But she said that her intention with the play is to encourage the audience to take part in the welfare debate. \"It's up to the audience whoever they vote for - it doesn't just stop on 2 March,\" she added. \"If the politicians you've voted for don't do what they say they were going to do, hold them accountable - we've every right to question our politicians and make them work for us.\" BBC News NI's Campaign Catch-up will keep you across the Northern Ireland Assembly election trail with a daily dose of the main stories, the minor ones and the lighter moments in the run up to polling day on Thursday 2 March.
