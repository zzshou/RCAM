{"article": "Many people seem to fear maps with their demand for some spatial grasp, byzantine symbols and tricky folding procedure - but I love them. I feel like a dying breed: a cartophiliac among a nation of cartophobes. I confess, even my toilet walls are papered with them. But now experts say a reliance on sat-navs and smartphone map apps is undermining map-reading skills. So here are five reasons why you should love maps and resist the easy attraction of the sat-nav. There is something intrinsically selfish about the sat-nav arrow and its radius of a few metres: it's all about you. But let your eye range over a map and discover a nearby lake, a beautiful view or a convenient watering hole. Maps open the world whereas sat-navs narrow your mind. Mountain Rescue services, the Ordnance Survey and every organisation I've come across promoting the outdoor life, all say having a map and the skill to read it is a safety essential. They have to be used in conjunction with the physical world, be that reading a sign, noticing a church (with or without a spire of course) or identifying that big hill on your right. This process of using your eyes and engaging your brain leaves memories and knowledge of the world around you. With sat-nav as a guide, nothing is learned nor loved about the journey. How often have you heard the excuse: \"Oh the sat-nav took me the wrong way\"? Without any apology for blinkered idiocy, celestial misguidance is the guilt-free excuse. I once worked with a camera crew who arrived two hours late at Snowdon claiming their sat-nav had taken them to the Anglesey ferry port. Entranced by the arrow they hadn't noticed or questioned leaving mainland Britain and crossing the big bridge over the Menai Strait. Now, addicts to digital direction devices may disagree, but I think this is inexcusably dumb. Maps are a partner to our intellect, not a replacement. The Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral shows the history, geography and destiny of Christian Europe as understood in the late 13th Century with pictures of the Pillars of Hercules, the Golden Fleece and a man riding a crocodile. Star maps use images of bears and gods to decipher the random. The London Tube map is a design icon.

{"article": "University College London researchers likened the impact to that of the death of a close friend or relative. They said the most important factor in developing a sense of mental wellbeing was parents' care and responsiveness. But controlling parents restricted their children's autonomy and stopped them developing a strong self-identity. They prevented them from learning from their own mistakes or conflicts. And this had a strong and persistent link with poor mental health throughout their life. Children with caring parents were more securely attached and therefore better able to manage future relationships, the researchers said. Mothers' and fathers' care were equally important predictors of mental health through to middle age. But paternal care had a greater association with wellbeing in later life. In the study, 2,000 people born in 1946 in England, Scotland and Wales were questioned in their adolescence, their 30s and 40s, and between the ages of 60 and 64 about their mental health. They were also asked to reflect on the quality of their relationships with their parents in the first 16 years of their life. Lead author Dr Mai Stafford said: \"All parents are to a certain extent caring and to a certain extent controlling. \"It's whether we feel our parents invaded our privacy or we feel we were well looked after. \"The more caring and the more understanding we are, the more we listen to our children and speak to them in a warm and friendly way.\" Dr Claire Hill, clinical psychologist specialising in parenting and child anxiety at the University of Reading, said: \"In the field of childhood anxiety disorders, there is a real lack of studies that include both. \"In some areas paternal care was more strongly associated with wellbeing than maternal care - the role of fathers should not be ignored when assessing psychological problems in children. \"Crucially the study suggests that parenting interventions should be aimed at both parents, and not just the primary caregiver, who is typically the mother.

No one was injured in the blaze but the hall was completely destroyed, with the cost of the damage estimated at â‚¬3.5m (Â£3m). An accomplice, who was not identified by the DPA news agency, was given a seven-year term, while four others were given suspended sentences of varying lengths. During the trial, 29-year-old Schneider had claimed that he was trying to send a political message but had not meant to burn down the building. He also denied that he had acted out of xenophobic motives. Many Germans consider the NPD, which has 5,000 members, to be a neo-Nazi group. Judge Theodor Horstkotter said Schneider and his accomplices had clearly acted on right-wing extremist beliefs. \"The attack was meant to signal to refugees: you are not welcome here, we don't have space for you, you aren't safe here,\" he said.

The four pointer in Drumnadrochit to escape the relegation play off place gave Glenurquhart their first Premiership victory for two months, 2-0 at home to Lochaber. Mid table, a late surge gave Lovat a 3-1 success at Kingussie but without a change in league placing for either side. And in the National Division, Kilmallie's 5-1 victory at Ballachulish means that they trail leaders Glasgow Mid Argyll only on goals scored. There had been much pre-match build up as Kinlochshiel prepared for their first trip across the Skye Bridge for a long time on serious shinty business and it was the visiting side who opened the scoring through Duncan DA MacRae after just 12 minutes. And there it looked as if it would stay until the penultimate minute when Murchison secured a share of the points. However Skye, with four draws in five games, still seek their first victory. Although Shiel are now a point clear of previous leaders Kyles, whose Celtic Society Cup tie in Oban was postponed, they have also played three more games. Glenurquhart, their defence of the MacTavish Cup already at an end and sitting second bottom in the league, were desperate to kick start their season on the visit of Lochaber. After a goalless first half, David Smart opened the scoring early in the second and Conor Golabek put the points in the bag late on. This leaves Lochaber in the play off place on goal difference and with two extra games played.

{"article": "Stokes, who made 10, was given out after bowler Mitchell Starc's throw at the stumps hit him on the left hand. \"If you're out of your crease and put your hand up to stop the ball, it's out,\" said Smith after the 64-run win. England captain Eoin Morgan said he would have withdrawn the appeal. Stokes is the first England batsman - and sixth overall - to be dismissed obstructing the field in a one-day international. Stokes left his crease after driving the ball back to Starc, who collected it in his follow-through and threw at the striker's end in an attempt to run him out. However, Stokes stopped the ball with his hand as he turned and dived to regain his ground. Smith chose not to withdraw Starc's appeal and, after on-field umpires Kumar Dharmesena and Tim Robinson referred the decision, television umpire Joel Wilson recommended that Stokes be given out. Smith said: \"It might have looked a bit worse because it went back to the bowler, but it's exactly the same as me turning for a second run, putting my arm out and stopping the ball. \"The ball wasn't going to hit him, he was out of his crease, he put his arm out and got in the way of the ball. The ball was going very close to hitting the stumps. How TMS commentary team called it: 'Well, I think that's ridiculous' \"If you read the rule book, we're well within our rights to appeal and the umpires have given it out.\" Asked if he considered withdrawing the appeal, Smith said: \"Not at all. I've got no dramas with that. \"I thought it was the right decision at the time and I still think it's the right decision.\" England captain Eoin Morgan, at the non-striker's end when the incident happened, said he would have called the batsman back if England were fielding. \"A guy throws the ball in your direction and all you can do is flinch,\" said Morgan, who made 85 as England were bowled out for 245 chasing 310 to win. \"You don't have time to think. It was a natural reaction to avoid the ball. Mitchell Starc was about five yards away from Ben Stokes. \"The decision was made. It would have been a lot different if we were fielding.\" Former England skipper Michael Vaughan said on BBC Test Match Special: \"Anyone who has played the game knows that when the ball is thrown at you from close range like that you put your hand up to protect yourself. \"When you see it in real time he fears the ball is going to hit him. It was obvious. It was a poor decision.\" Ex-England wicketkeeper Alec Stewart added: \"He was taking evasive action; he's looking the other way. Show me someone who can catch the ball looking the other way? \"You would have thought between the three umpires that common sense would have prevailed.\" Former Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne tweeted: \"We didn't like to see what happened at Lord's.

{"article": "Benteke scored in either half as Sam Allardyce's Eagles mounted a brilliant fightback after Liverpool took the lead through Philippe Coutinho's fine free-kick. Liverpool sold Benteke to Palace last summer for £5m less than they paid for the Belgium striker a year earlier, but it was his burly presence in the final third that proved the difference in an entertaining contest. His first was a well-taken strike high into the net from Yohan Cabaye's low cross, his second a poacher's header from six yards after some lax Liverpool defending at a corner. Palace - who also earned a brilliant win at leaders Chelsea on 1 April - have won six of their last eight league games to move on to 38 points, seven clear of danger and are all but assured of another season of top-flight football. They have now triumphed on their last three league visits to Anfield - the first team to achieve that feat since Chelsea in October 2005. Jurgen Klopp's Reds stay in third place, but they have played two games more than both Manchester City in fourth place and fifth-placed Manchester United, who are two and three points back respectively. Media playback is not supported on this device On a day when one of their former players put on a striking masterclass, Liverpool's shortcomings in front of goal will be acutely felt. Klopp's side racked up 72% possession, but just one shot on target in more than 90 minutes of play was scant return on that perceived dominance. Coutinho's brilliant 30-yard strike aside, Wayne Hennessey in the Palace goal had few scares, with the players in front of him performing superbly, particularly when they were called on to crowd out Coutinho when the Brazilian threatened to weave a path to goal in the second half. A woeful mis-hit by Emre Can after good approach work by James Milner and Roberto Firmino summed up Liverpool's performance in the final third, and their manager conceded they had been guilty of failing to make the most of their possession. \"We dominated the game,\" Klopp said. \"You have to be ready for the one moment. In the second half we had a really good period when everything was OK apart from the goal. \"We did a lot of good things but we could not finalise it. That's the most important thing in football.\" To say Anfield has become a happy hunting ground for Palace in recent years would be something of an understatement. Palace were famously thumped 9-0 in the league there in 1989, but those days are now long gone, with the club from south-east London enjoying a sequence of three straight wins at the famous old ground. They spoiled Steven Gerrard's Liverpool farewell with their first win in 2015, while the following season they inflicted a first defeat for Klopp in his seventh game at the helm. This latest win was perhaps in part down to the confidence gleaned from those performances, as well as a superb run of form during April that also brought a one-sided win over Arsenal at Selhurst Park. Palace had just seven shots on goal and three on target - but that was all they needed. What chances they created were far more clear-cut than those of their opponents, and in Benteke they had the perfect target man to finish off the job. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I have no idea how Crystal Palace are in the situation they are. We knew it was difficult. We were dominant, you cannot create 20 chances in a game like this, you have to work and that is what we did. \"We scored a fantastic goal and more interesting situations and then out of nothing let them score. After you could see their confidence grew and in the second half we were dominant. \"They had counter-attack threat but again out of nothing we gave them an opportunity from a corner. The decisive one we missed the ball at the front post. \"It is frustrating, disappointing of course. Everyone thinks the Champions League has slipped through our fingers but we have one more month to stay positive. We have to try everything to squeeze everything out of this season.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: \"Some goals you can't stop and that one we couldn't stop. But the recovery from that is good. Out of possession we frustrated Liverpool today so much that they had little opportunity to have a clean shot on goal. \"Liverpool were only as good as we allowed them to be. They had a lot of possession as did Chelsea and Arsenal. We did more with our possession than Liverpool and that is why we won. \"We finished our analysis with how many goals Liverpool have conceded from corners. We showed that it might not be the first ball in but the second or third if we make runs in the right areas. \"It has been hard work but we are looking up. We have five games to go but Tottenham on Wednesday will come too early. We will have to change the side to get fresh legs into the side. It is a big result today, it makes life so much easier.\" Palace do not have long to prepare for their next match with Tottenham, who visit Selhurst Park on Wednesday (20:00 BST).

{"article": "I wonder whether they had an instrument that measured enormous sighs of relief in Brooklyn, home of the Hillary Clinton campaign,  as Joe Biden bade farewell to his presidential ambitions. The mass exhalation of breath of all the Clintonistas must have been quite something. After her rock-solid and statesmanlike performance in the Democratic debate in Las Vegas last week, Clinton's poll position has been consolidated. The only pesky cloud on the horizon was Joe Biden. For all those people who don't quite like Clinton - and you don't have to scratch the surface very hard to find huge numbers of these people - but couldn't bring themselves to vote for the self-styled democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, then the entry of Biden into the race could have shaken things up quite considerably. For a start it would have given Barack Obama a knotty little problem of whom to support. The superbly well-qualified Clinton, or lovable and loyal Biden. It could have certainly taken vital funding away from Clinton towards his camp. Let's take Biden at his word this was all about whether the time he needed to grieve his son Beau would forbid a tilt at the White House. But certainly his supporters and closest advisers were scoping a run - what they would need to do to put an infrastructure in place, whether the \"bundlers\" would be able to raise the money to mount a well-financed campaign. If it was a clear cut decision for either Biden or his most senior aides, we would have heard before now what his intentions were. So what are we left with from today's Rose Garden address? Let's play the fun political game of here's what he said, and here's what he meant. First what he said: \"I intend to speak out clearly and forcefully, to influence as much as I can where we stand as a party and where we need to go as a nation.... I believe that President Obama has led this nation from crisis to recovery, and we're now on the cusp of resurgence. I'm proud to have played a part in that. This party, our nation, will be making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy. The American people have worked too hard, and we have have come too far for that. Democrats should not only defend this record and protect this record. They should run on the record.\" Let's put that through the politico-translator app. What comes out? Hillary, if you want me to back you don't go around trash-talking the president's record. He did great things. You were part of it and you agreed with it,  so don't go dissing him otherwise you'll have me to contend with. Then there's this passage: \"I believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart. And I think we can. It's mean spirited, it's petty, and it's gone on for much too long. I don't believe, like some do, that it's naive to talk to Republicans. I don't think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition.\" Translation? Clinton- enough already with the 'Republicans are our enemies'. If you win you're going to have to govern with them, so stop being so bloody divisive. (I think this must be an app from the UK). And then I put this final phrase in: \"I am absolutely certain that we fully are capable of accomplishing extraordinary things. We can do this. And when we do, America won't just win the future, we will own the finish line.\" I had to translate this a couple of times because it didn't seem to bear much relationship to what I had typed in. It came out as - I might not be running, but I would have been a great president. But that's not going to happen now - and there is not much left in the road to trip Clinton up - just some Sanders-shaped bumps in her way. Given the troubled and maladroit way the email saga has been handled that can't be entirely ruled out. And if something did go horribly wrong with Clinton's campaign - wouldn't the Democratic Party turn to the vice-president in its moment of need, saying: \"Come on Joe\". And he would say \"You bet\".

Campaigner Monica Lewinsky, musicians Andrew WK and Moby attended his party, while Pharrell Williams recorded a special video message of support that was played at the party. Mr O'Brien's story has become popular in the US after the social media campaign brought his story to the public's attention. Pictures of him dancing and then looking upset after he was mocked were posted online, first on message board 4chan and then to the website Reddit. They were posted with the caption: \"Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week.

A group of American supporters, including American writer Cassandra Fairbanks, arranged for him to fly to California for this weekend's events. His party, which was attended by about 1,000 people, raised money for anti-bullying charities. Mr O'Brien has also appeared on US television dancing with pop star Meghan Trainor on the Today show. He told its viewers his experiences after becoming famous had been \"completely surreal\". He added: \"It's something I never thought would ever happen in my life. It's amazing.

It is a key ally of the US and, together with Egypt, one of only two Arab nations to have made peace with Israel. The desert kingdom emerged out of the post-World War I division of the Middle East by Britain and France. The population at that time was largely made up of tribes which had taken part in the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Today, those original inhabitants - known as East Bank Jordanians - are outnumbered by the descendants of Palestinian refugees from Israel and the West Bank. Country profiles by BBC Monitoring The first ruler of Jordan, the Hashemite Abdullah I, was born in Mecca and played a leading role in the Great Arab Revolt. The death in February 1999 of King Hussein, who ruled for 46 years, left Jordan still struggling for economic and social survival, as well as regional peace. His son, Abdullah II faces the task of maintaining stability while accommodating calls for reform. A blueprint for long-term political, economic and social change - known as the National Agenda - has yet to be implemented, and the Arab Spring popular revolts across the region found some resonance in street protests. Jordan's reputation as one of the region's safest countries was dealt a blow in late 2005 when dozens of people were killed in suicide bomb attacks on hotels in the capital. Iraq-based Islamic militants claimed responsibility. The king said Jordan had been targeted because of its location and its stances. The civil war in neighbouring Syria has seen Jordan play host to some 600,000 Syrian refugees, while the resurgence of Islamic militancy in Iraq also presents security challenges for Amman. Unlike Arab states to the south and east, Jordan has no oil of its own. Its resources are limited to phosphates and agricultural produce. The economy depends largely on services, tourism and foreign aid, of which the US is the main provider. Jordan prides itself on its health service, one of the best in the region.

Last week, Court of Appeal judges ruled that the conviction was unsafe. Diplock courts without juries have been used in Northern Ireland since 1973. The system was introduced to combat jury intimidation by paramilitaries. In 1975, Mr Llewellyn was abducted as he delivered hardboard to a building in the Falls Road area which had been damaged by a bomb. He was taken to a house nearby and shot. Patrick Livingstone, now 62, was found guilty of the murder. In an interview with the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Livingstone said he was \"still trying to take in\" last week's judgement of the Court of Appeal. \"You feel vindicated, you feel better about yourself, because you know you were right all along,\" he said. When he was convicted, Mr Livingstone was told he would serve the rest of his life in jail. He was the first person in Northern Ireland to be given what was then called a \"natural life\" term, but he was released from jail in 1994. He began the appeal process in 2007. Mr Livingstone said there were other convictions from the past which were not fair. \"Diplock (non-jury) courts are inherently unsafe,\" he said. \"One man cannot sit up there and decide on your life. \"Diplock courts should be scrubbed now and all Diplock decisions should be expunged.\" He also said he had \"nothing but the greatest sympathy\" for friends and family of Samuel Llewellyn. The non-jury system is named after Lord Diplock, a former senior judge and Law Lord.

Arterton plays Catrin Cole, a screenwriter hired to bring a female perspective to war films produced by the British Ministry of Information. The film had its gala screening the BFI London Film Festival on Thursday night. The film shows how she has to put up with a lower salary than her male counterparts and has to fight pressure to dilute the female roles in her screenplay. In the film, the female dialogue is referred to as \"slop\" - a term used in some film-making circles at the time. \"It's obviously sexist,\" Arterton said ahead of the screening, \"but funnily enough for Catrin I don't think she's aware of it. I  think at that time it was just kind of accepted.\" She added: \"What I like about Catrin is that she is a feminist and she doesn't know it yet.\" Arterton stars in the film alongside Bill Nighy, who plays a fading movie actor, and Hunger Games star Sam Claflin as Catrin's colleague at the ministry. Their Finest is Danish film-maker Scherfig's fifth film set in the UK. Her other films include An Education and The Riot Club. \"I never felt this that film was primarily a feminist film,\" Scherfig told the BBC. \"The whole story of a woman finding out what she can do and gaining respect for it is definitely the main plot but the whole package - about London and the film industry - is what gives the film its depth and complexity.\" Producer Stephen Woolley said he had loved making a film about a time when making films was so important. \"When they made films in the 1940s it was a matter of life and death.

But when they met on Thursday to discuss possible options, returning to the old format was not one of them. F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone says there will be more talks early next month. The new format, which saw drivers eliminated every 90 seconds through three sessions of qualifying, came in for criticism in Melbourne last weekend. That's because it led to an empty track for the last four minutes of the top-eight shootout as teams saved their tyres rather than do another lap. At an emergency meeting on Sunday, teams agreed unanimously to revert to the 2015 format. This consisted of three knockout sessions, with the slowest cars only eliminated after each session had finished.. However, this option was not on the table when the F1 Commission finally met on Thursday. Instead, teams were presented with two options: As neither had been discussed by the teams in advance, agreement was not reached. The F1 Commission features Ecclestone and representatives of all the teams, governing body the FIA, tyre supplier Pirelli, sponsors and circuits. To be able to make a rule change during a World Championship, unanimity is needed. In this case, that did not happen.

The United States and the European Union have pressed Kosovo to address the accusations. The constitutional changes were backed by 82 deputies in the 120-seat parliament on Monday.

{"article": "It was produced by the Oxford Economics consultancy for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. The report says the the main area of vulnerability relates to the high level of trade with the Republic of Ireland. A referendum on whether the UK should stay in the EU will be held on 23 June. Other areas of concern highlighted by the report are the relative dependence on foreign investment and the type of manufacturing industry in Northern Ireland. Oxford Economics considered nine potential scenarios for the UK's trading relationships if it leaves the EU. In the best case scenario there would be virtually no impact on Northern Ireland economy. That is described as the \"liberal customs union\", in which the UK would no longer have to contribute to the EU budget but could not make its own trade deals. That scenario would see deregulation, tax cuts and only modest restrictions on immigration. In the worst case, economic output in Northern Ireland would be more than 5% lower in 2030 than it otherwise would have been. That is described as the \"populist most favoured nation\" scenario, in which the UK fails to make a free trade deal with the EU, aggressively clamps down on immigration and spends more on public services. Under a \"moderate free trade agreement\", in which the UK makes a free trade deal, clamps down on immigration and concentrates on deficit reduction the Northern Ireland economy would still see growth 3% lower than it would otherwise have been in 2030. Oxford Economics research found that \"in any plausible scenario\" the UK economy would have its growth curtailed post-exit from the EU. In eight of the nine scenarios, the Northern Ireland economy would suffer a bigger hit than the UK as a whole. The consultancy concludes that Northern Ireland would be particularly vulnerable if a free trade agreement could not be made with the EU. That is mainly because of its \"unique characteristic\" of sharing a land border with an EU state. It also reflects Northern Ireland's \"reliance on foreign direct investment as a source of financing for investment\".", "question": "Northern Ireland 's economy is relatively \" more vulnerable \" than other parts of the UK to potentially negative impacts of a @placeholder from the European Union , a new report has said .", "option_0": "approval", "option_1": "backlash", "option_2": "withdrawal", "option_3": "challenge", "option_4": "directly", "label": 2}

Marine Harvest cited a number of factors for the difficulty in tackling the problem of sea lice in Scotland. They included \"abnormally high water temperatures for extended periods\" and insufficient cleaner fish capacity. Sea lice feed on the skin and blood of salmon, and can weaken the health of fish and its growth. In its annual report, Marine Harvest highlighted the impact of the parasites on its operations in Scotland, where it operates more than 50 sites. Last year, it harvested about 45,000 tonnes of salmon of Scottish origin - more than 5,000 less than in 2015. The company said mortality losses amounted to 6.5 million euros, while costs associated with sea lice treatment and mitigation rose substantially. Marine Harvest said it had made good progress in tackling sea lice at its business units in Ireland, Canada and to some extent Chile. However, it added: \"Disappointingly, several factors, including abnormally high water temperatures for extended periods, insufficient cleaner fish capacity, limited access to non-medicinal treatment systems and extraordinary lice pressure, singly or in combination, precluded optimal control and hampered full application of our strategy in Scotland.\" The group said new non-medicinal lice treatment methods, including Thermolicers - which bathe fish briefly in lukewarm water - had generated \"new challenges\", particularly at its Greshornish site on the Isle of Skye. It added: \"At Greshornish, we lost 115,283 fish during our first full-scale Thermolicer treatment because we lacked experience and failed to fully anticipate the consequences of treating fish compromised by amoebic gill disease with water of up to 34 degrees centigrade. \"This incident highlights the importance of experience and the fine line in judging how and when we treat our fish stocks. We will do our utmost to prevent this from happening in the future.\"Â  Marine Harvest said its research and development focus now included the \"optimisation\" of non-medicinal treatments and cleaner-fish use, as well as \"biotechnological solutions\". Chief executive Alf-Helge Aarskog said: \"Sea lice remain our number one challenge, and as such will continue to be our top R&D priority for the foreseeable future. \"Uncontrolled, sea lice impact fish welfare, survival and growth. \"However, it has become apparent that sea lice numbers can be brought under control through increased use of non-medicinal treatment methods. \"Although we still have a way to go, we increased our use of non-medicinal tools in 2016 and expect to reap the benefits of our efforts going forward.\"", "question": "Marine Harvest has revealed that more than two - thirds of its salmon farms in Scotland broke @placeholder sea lice limits last year .", "option_0": "control", "option_1": "lost", "option_2": "temporarily", "option_3": "improved", "option_4": "statutory", "label": 4}

They broke away to form the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) but religious gatherings of free blacks and slaves were prohibited and its founders were swiftly jailed. In 1822, the Church was again a target of the authorities after they foiled a planned slave revolt led by Denmark Vesey, one of the founders. More than 1,000 people were arrested over the plan and 35 of them, including Vesey, were executed and the church itself was burned down. It was rebuilt in 1834 but with all-black Churches outlawed, its members met in secret until it was officially recognised following the end of the American Civil War in 1865 - when the name Emanuel was adopted. An earthquake in August 1886 left the structure badly damaged. The church that stands on Calhoun Street, Charleston, today dates back from when rebuilding works were completed in 1891. The church became a focal point again in the 1950s and 1960s when black leaders used it as a rallying point in the civil rights movement. Dr Martin Luther King Jr gave a speech at the church in April 1962, urging the black community to register and vote in elections.

A study, on nearly 15,000 people in Scotland, found the condition increased the risk of miscarriage by 76%. The team at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary said that women needed to be informed of the risk. Endometriosis can be hard to identify and is thought to affect between 2% and 10% of women. Symptoms include painful periods and stomach pain. The research team analysed data from 5,375 women with endometriosis and 8,280 healthy women. Data to be presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology will show most pregnancies were fine, but there was a higher rate of complications. The odds of an ectopic pregnancy - in which the foetus develops outside the womb - were nearly trebled from 0.6% normally to 1.6% with endometriosis. The chance of miscarriage increased by 76%, a premature birth by 26% and the need for a caesarean section by 40%. It is thought changes to the way the uterus functions as well as increased inflammation were damaging the pregnancy. Dr Lucky Saraswat, who will present the findings at the meeting in Lisbon, said: \"Some things cannot be changed like ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage. \"[If] we can diagnose it sooner so we can act sooner... with early intervention and probably improve outcomes for these women.\" She said such women may need extra monitoring, such as more ultrasound scans, during the pregnancy.

{"article": "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said troops had captured Tal Uwayshiya, a hill 9km (6 miles) to the south-east. It overlooks a key road linking al-Bab to the IS-controlled city of Raqqa, in a neighbouring province. Al-Bab is now almost surrounded by Turkish-backed Syrian rebels. The rebels are laying siege from the north, east and west. It is not yet clear whether the Syrian government is also aiming to capture the town, which is considered a prize by all sides in the five-year civil war. But a military source told the pro-government al-Masdar website that troops were now within striking distance of the village of Tadif, on the outskirts of al-Bab. The government has denounced Turkey's support of the rebel offensive, which was launched in August with the aim of clearing IS militants from a border area north of al-Bab and limiting gains to the east by Kurdish forces. Despite that, President Bashar al-Assad's ally Russia has carried out joint air strikes with Turkey on IS positions around al-Bab since January. The Syrian Observatory also reported on Monday that Turkish troops and rebel fighters were engaged in deadly clashes with IS militants around the village of Bazaa, east of al-Bab, which was recaptured by the jihadists over the weekend. Government forces were also battling IS in the central province of Homs, after capturing the Hayyan oilfield west of Palmyra, the UK-based monitoring group said. It comes as a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters begins a new phase of their offensive to isolate Raqqa. The Syrian Democratic Forces announced on Saturday that it aimed to take areas east of the city, including the main road linking it to Deir al-Zour province, almost all of which is controlled by IS.

{"article": "The £150m bridge is the idea of actress Joanna Lumley and has been designed by London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic cauldron creator Thomas Heatherwick. Shadow transport minister Lord Davies of Oldham described the bridge as a \"very expensive piece of public art\". The government said the scheme would increase visitor numbers to London. During question time at the House of Lords, Lord Davies said Treasury Minister Lord Deighton was answering for the government on the issue rather than a transport minister \"because the bridge can scarcely be defined as a means of transport\". The government has pledged £30m towards the bridge which will link London's Southbank to the north side of the river at Temple underground station. Last month a public consultation on the project closed, after which the developers were expected to apply for planning approval. It is hoped that work on the 1,214 ft-long (370m) pedestrian crossing will start next year and the bridge will be open by 2017. Lord Davies said: \"It is a very expensive piece of public art. It is a vanity project of the mayor. \"We know where his vanity projects have gone and what they have cost the country in terms of the cycle hire scheme, which is in trouble, the Emirates gondola crossing down at Greenwich, that carries so few passengers as to be risible, and, of course, the taxpayer is going to have to pick up the bill.\" The bridge will be covered with trees and plants arranged by television gardener Dan Pearson. Lord Lloyd of Berwick, a former law lord and independent cross-bencher, said there was no need for another crossing at that part of the river. He asked Lord Deighton: \"Why waste £30m of public money on creating a so-called garden bridge? \"There are gardens all along the embankment from the Inner Temple garden to Westminster where trees are growing.\" Speaking on behalf of the government, Lord Deighton told peers: \"The key to the garden bridge is it is two for the price of one - it is a garden and a bridge and combines the benefits of both.\" He said the Treasury would provide £30m to support the bridge if a business case proved it was value for money. He added that the new transport connection would \"switch people out of cars on to their feet\" and increase London visitor numbers. \"There is significant development value - you are really connecting up the South Bank and the creative centre there with Aldwych and Covent Garden,\" he said. \"The development it will bring on each side will be of significant value.\"", "question": "A @placeholder \" garden bridge \" over the River Thames has been labelled as a \" vanity project \" of the Mayor of London , a Labour party peer has said .", "option_0": "revised", "option_1": "troubled", "option_2": "major", "option_3": "controversial", "option_4": "proposed", "label": 4}

{"article": "Achieving such temperatures is necessary to study fundamental properties of matter and the strange effects caused by quantum mechanics. The new method relies on \"optical lattices\" of atoms from which only the hottest atoms are selectively removed. The approach, reported in Nature , may be well-suited to create memory for future quantum computers. The limits of low temperature have been constantly pushed in recent years, and the current best lies somewhere in the nanoKelvin regime - that is, within just billionths of a degree of \"absolute zero\" at zero Kelvin or -273.15C. That ultimate limit is set formally as the lowest possible entropy, or disorder, that is achievable. Optical lattices are an ideal system in which to attain temperatures ever nearer that limit. The peaks and troughs of intensity in crossed beams of light form a kind of \"egg-crate\" structure in which atoms are inclined to remain in the troughs - a point of lowest energy. As the atoms are added to each trough - or each point in the lattice - it becomes more difficult to add another, in a situation called a blockade. But researchers from Harvard University have invented a modification to this effect called orbital exchange blockade. It is a way to cool these assemblages of atoms that could be extended to the picoKelvin regime: within trillionths of a degree of the coldest possible temperature. The team carefully adjusted the intensity of the crossed light beams. The trick was to do so in such a way that only the most energetic atoms in each lattice site absorbed energy from the light fields, becoming more energetic again. By adjusting how frequently the light beam intensities were changed, the team was able to remove these \"hottest\" atoms from the system, leaving only the \"coolest\" ones behind. The approach removed entropy, or in other words, reduced the overall temperature of the lattice. In an accompanying article in Nature , optical lattice expert Gretchen Campbell from US measurement agency Nist points out that this ability to specifically address single lattice sites, and potentially to cool to never-before-achieved temperatures, may make the approach useful in quantum computers. These devices, still in early developmental stages, would make use of the slippery nature of quantum states to perform computation at incredible speeds. But like any computer, they would need memory, and optical lattices that keep delicate quantum information preserved in cold atoms could be a suitable solution.", "question": "Researchers have developed a @placeholder way to achieve the lowest temperatures ever recorded on Earth .", "option_0": "unique", "option_1": "funky", "option_2": "controversial", "option_3": "clever", "option_4": "major", "label": 3}

{"article": "The researchers constructed a bacterium's \"genetic software\" and transplanted it into a host cell. The resulting microbe then looked and behaved like the species \"dictated\" by the synthetic DNA. The advance, published in Science, has been hailed as a scientific landmark, but critics say there are dangers posed by synthetic organisms. Some also suggest that the potential benefits of the technology have been over-stated. But the researchers hope eventually to design bacterial cells that will produce medicines and fuels and even absorb greenhouse gases. The team was led by Dr Craig Venter of the J Craig Venter Institute (JCVI) in Maryland and California. He and his colleagues had previously made a synthetic bacterial genome, and transplanted the genome of one bacterium into another. Now, the scientists have put both methods together, to create what they call a \"synthetic cell\", although only its genome is truly synthetic. Dr Venter likened the advance to making new software for the cell. The researchers copied an existing bacterial genome. They sequenced its genetic code and then used \"synthesis machines\" to chemically construct a copy. Dr Venter told BBC News: \"We've now been able to take our synthetic chromosome and transplant it into a recipient cell - a different organism. \"As soon as this new software goes into the cell, the cell reads [it] and converts into the species specified in that genetic code.\" The new bacteria replicated over a billion times, producing copies that contained and were controlled by the constructed, synthetic DNA. \"This is the first time any synthetic DNA has been in complete control of a cell,\" said Dr Venter. Dr Venter and his colleagues hope eventually to design and build new bacteria that will perform useful functions. \"I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,\" he said. \"If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.\" Read Susan Watts's thoughts Analysis from around the world Send us your comments Dr Venter and his colleagues are already collaborating with pharmaceutical and fuel companies to design and develop chromosomes for bacteria that would produce useful fuels and new vaccines. But critics say that the potential benefits of synthetic organisms have been overstated. Dr Helen Wallace from Genewatch UK, an organisation that monitors developments in genetic technologies, told BBC News that synthetic bacteria could be dangerous. \"If you release new organisms into the environment, you can do more harm than good,\" she said. \"By releasing them into areas of pollution, [with the aim of cleaning it up], you're actually releasing a new kind of pollution. \"We don't know how these organisms will behave in the environment.\" Profile: Craig Venter Q&A: The meaning of synthetic life Ethics concern over synthetic cell Dr Wallace accused Dr Venter of playing down the potential drawbacks. \"He isn't God,\" she said, \"he's actually being very human; trying to get money invested in his technology and avoid regulation that would restrict its use.\" But Dr Venter said that he was \"driving the discussions\" about the regulations governing this relatively new scientific field and about the ethical implications of the work. He said: \"In 2003, when we made the first synthetic virus, it underwent an extensive ethical review that went all the way up to the level of the White House. \"And there have been extensive reviews including from the National Academy of Sciences, which has done a comprehensive report on this new field. \"We think these are important issues and we urge continued discussion that we want to take part in.\" Dr Gos Micklem, a geneticist from the University of Cambridge, said that the advance was \"undoubtedly a landmark\" study. But, he said, \"there is already a wealth of simple, cheap, powerful and mature techniques for genetically engineering a range of organisms. Therefore, for the time being, this approach is unlikely to supplant existing methods for genetic engineering\". The ethical discussions surrounding the creation of synthetic or artificial life are set to continue. Professor Julian Savulescu, from the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at the University of Oxford, said the potential of this science was \"in the far future, but real and significant\". \"But the risks are also unparalleled,\" he continued. \"We need new standards of safety evaluation for this kind of radical research and protections from military or terrorist misuse and abuse. \"These could be used in the future to make the most powerful bioweapons imaginable.

{"article": "The mathematical model offered \"an initial idea\" of what a particular level of surveillance could achieve. The work comes at a time when the number of invasive pathogens, including those affecting crops, is on the rise as a result of global trade and travel. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. \"Surveillance efforts have been getting increasing attention because early detection is crucial in order to control these epidemics,\" explained co-author Stephen Parnell from the University of Salford, UK. \"If you want to have a chance of controlling them or getting rid of them then you really have to catch them at a very early stage.\" One example of an invasive pathogen threatening an important food crop is the arrival of a virulent bacterium in southern Italy. A report by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in January observed that the pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa, was responsible for a \"rapid decline\" in affected olive plantations. \"Major consequences\", such as reduced yields and costly control measures, would be the outcome if it spread to other olive-producing regions in the EU, it added. In July, France reported an outbreak on the Mediterranean island of Corisca. The European Commission described the pathogen as one of the biggest threats to plants around the globe. Detection probability Dr Parnell told BBC News: \"Surveillance is a very expensive process so if you are doing surveillance following an invasive epidemic then you want to know what the probability is of detecting the epidemic at a low prevalence. \"This was an epidemic modelling approach where we could - given the amount of surveillance that was being done, and information about how quickly an epidemic spreads once it invades - we were able to tell you at what incidence you would be likely to detect it. \"If you have that information then the idea is that you could adjust your surveillance effort if you need to detect it at an earlier stage.\" He added that there was currently very little information about how well detection efforts were likely to perform in terms of finding invasive pathogens. \"This model is giving just a little more evidence to support and help inform how much surveillance needs to be done for certain disease threats,\" Dr Parnell said. \"The benefit of this approach is that it is very simple. The only information you need about the epidemic is an estimate of what we call 'epidemic growth rate', that is once the epidemic invades, how quickly does it increase over time?\" Fire fighting Although maintaining an ongoing monitoring network was costly, the consequences of killer diseases becoming established in an area could have a landscape-changing impact. \"An analogy I often use is of a fire,\" explained Dr Parnell. \"If there was a fire in a house, you would want to catch it as soon as it lit the tip of a curtain rather than when it has lit up an entire room. \"It is a similar situation with an epidemic, you have to catch it at a very early stage because a lot of the control methods we use, for example with tree health problems, are felling of large stands of forest. \"The area you would need to fell can quickly escalate so it is really, really important to catch it at an early stage.\"", "question": "Researchers have developed a way to help @placeholder the level of surveillance required to detect the arrival of costly invasive diseases .", "option_0": "improve", "option_1": "determine", "option_2": "reduce", "option_3": "prevent", "option_4": "resolve", "label": 1}

The sketchbooks span his career from the mid 1940s until his death in 2011. \"This rare collection of Lucian Freud drawings and letters provides a fascinating glimpse into the work of one of our most pioneering artists,\" said Culture Minister Ed Vaizey. \"Bringing these never seen before treasures into public collections means that everyone can enjoy and see the early beginnings that shaped his most celebrated work.\" The archive includes studies for many of the artist's major works as well as a collection of 162 childhood drawings depicting family life. They were made while Freud was living in Germany, before his family fled to England in 1933 as Hitler came to power, and saved and dated by his mother. The National Portrait Gallery said the archive would \"give added context\" to the two works housed in the gallery's collection - a self-portrait in oils and a charcoal drawing of Lord Goodman from 1985. Several drawings in the sketchbooks show the beginnings of portraits, including Lord Goodman's, starting with the nose and eyes and developing outwards. Also included are Freud's early designs of book covers including one for his daughter, Esther Freud's 1992 novel Hideous Kinky and Nigel Dennis's Cards of Identity from 1955. Dr Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery in London, said the archive material was a \"very important, extensive and generous gift to the nation\" that would be \"a vital source of reference\". The 47 sketchbooks together with drawings and letters settle a bill of Â£2,940,000 of inheritance tax from the Lucian Freud Estate, under the inheritance in lieu scheme.

With the club now valued at about £100m, shares are believed to have increased tenfold in worth since the current board took charge in 2002. Levien is the managing general partner of Major League Soccer side DC United, while Kaplan is principal of Oaktree Capital investment fund and vice-chairman of NBA franchise Memphis Grizzlies. They are understood to be keen to buy Swansea's home ground, Liberty Stadium, which is owned by the local council, with a view to increasing its capacity. Levien and Kaplan had initially been negotiating a deal which would have seen them acquire more than 75% of Swansea's shares, effectively giving the American consortium complete control, including the power to issue more shares. However, the modified acquisition of 60% will see the trust retain its 21.1% stake and ensure continuity at board level with the retention of Jenkins and Dineen. Swansea will be based in Washington DC, home of Levien's DC United, for their pre-season tour to the USA in July. *Martin Morgan resigned from his post as a director of OTH Ltd on 4 April 2016 **Brian Katzen and Jeffrey Crevoiserat own one more share than the Swansea City Supporters' Trust, giving them less than 0.1% more of a share.", "question": "The American takeover of Swansea City worth about £ 100 m has been completed , subject to Premier League @placeholder .", "option_0": "survival", "option_1": "interest", "option_2": "power", "option_3": "approval", "option_4": "expectations", "label": 3}

Demonstrators first took to the streets on 1 April to demand elections, after the courts tried to strengthen the president's grip on power. Marches in various cities descended into clashes between riot police and protesters, which have left 28 people dead. Observers fear 1 May could bring a spike in unrest, with opposition and pro-government supporters planning rival marches. Pope Francis has offered to mediate between the Maduro government and its opponents, but the opposition has rejected the overture. Its leaders say the president has installed a dictatorship, and blame him for Venezuela's economic crisis.

Three US air strikes on Saturday around Musa Qala reportedly killed up to 40 Taliban fighters but the militants regrouped to push Afghan ground forces back. District governor Mohamad Sharif said he fled the district on Wednesday morning as the Taliban attacked. \"We left the district early in the morning because the Taliban were attacking from all sides,\" he told Reuters. \"We had asked for reinforcements for days but none arrived and this was what happened.\" In southern Helmand, also on Wednesday, two Nato soldiers were killed when two men in Afghan military uniforms opened fire on a vehicle at a military base.

Musa Qala was once a Taliban stronghold and centre of the country's opium trade, but the defection of a local Taliban commander, Mullah Salaam, helped turn the tide in favour of Western forces.

UK forces led the counter-insurgency operations in Helmand during the protracted conflict with the Taliban and lost more than 400 soldiers there in the process. Now the Taliban have recaptured the key parts of the province, in the first summer fighting season since foreign troops formally stepped back from combat roles in the country. Violence has increased sharply across Afghanistan since most foreign forces withdrew in December, leaving only a small contingent of about 12,000 Nato troops to train Afghan forces.

After she wrote a Facebook post about her ordeal which went viral, senior BJP politician in Haryana state Ramveer Bhatti blamed Ms Kundu for what happened to her. \"The girl should not have gone out at 12 in the night,\" he told the CNN-News18 television channel. \"Why was she driving so late in the night? The atmosphere is not right. We need to take care of ourselves.\" Mr Bhatti then went on to tell The Times of India that \"parents must take care of their children. They shouldn't allow them to roam at night. Children should come home on time, why stay out at night?\" This \"victim shaming\" didn't go down well, and soon women began posting photos of themselves out at night under the hashtag #AintNoCinderella. The campaign was launched by Divya Spandana, head of the opposition Congress party's social media cell who is a popular film actress from the southern state of Karnataka and often goes by her screen name Ramya. \"Why shouldn't women go out after midnight? I'm asking people like Mr Bhatti who are they to set curfew hours for us? I want to ask him who is he to question us? This is such a regressive mindset,\" Ms Spandana told the BBC. She started out by sending a message to some women on her WhatsApp group on Monday evening. \"Ladies, how often have you heard something regressive like this from the mouth of a 'leader' who doesn't know much better? I'll answer: too often,\" the message said. \"This time they're telling us when we can and cannot go out of the our houses. This has to STOP\" she added. Then, she posted an image of herself on Twitter and invited other women to do the same. The campaign soon caught on and hundreds of women have since posted photographs on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram challenging patriarchal mindsets that always blame women. Among the first to post a midnight selfie was Sharmistha Mukherjee, Congress party leader and daughter of former Indian president Pranab Mukherjee: Many others followed up, often with defiant messages: When journalist Palak Sharma posted her image, sipping a drink and winking at the camera, she got loads of messages appreciating her \"bold stand\": \"But in the last two days, I've received lots of threats too. I've been called a whore, a slut,\" she told the BBC. \"Think about it - I'm a journalist, I work for the government-run media, I'm no pushover and I'm being threatened for my tweet,\" she said. \"But I'm not afraid,\" Ms Sharma added. \"Nothing is going to stop us, no amount of naysayers can frighten us. We aren't Cinderellas, we don't have to be home at midnight.\" With more and more women joining the campaign, it seems many others are refusing to be intimidated too.", "question": "Women in India have been posting photographs of themselves @placeholder a night out on social media in response to a politician who said a woman who was chased in her car by two men \" should not have gone out so late at night \" .", "option_0": "investigating", "option_1": "exploiting", "option_2": "renewing", "option_3": "violating", "option_4": "enjoying", "label": 4}

According to the Miami Herald, the incident began after 22:00 local time on Monday over drinks at the members-only club, located just steps from the State Capitol. A lawmaker approached Mr Artiles to ask if his objections to a bill she had filed were political payback for her questions about one of his previous bills.

They uncovered a honey in Gwynedd \"as potent\" as New Zealand's famed Manuka. The team is now setting up an urban honey-making scheme to see if it can be brought to market. Prof Les Baillie, of the university's School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, said the joint study with the National Botanic Garden of Wales had created more excitement than anything else in his three decades in science. \"It's one of those projects that has amazed us as we have gone through. Every time we turn around we find something else quite cool,\" he added. The team discovered two hives in the garden of amateur beekeeper Chris Hickman, of Tywyn, Cardigan Bay, which created honey with as much antibacterial power as that from the nectar of the Manuka tree. \"Two hives will never replicate New Zealand's thousands of tonnes of Manuka honey a year,\" Prof Baillie said. However, by identifying the plants visited by the Tywyn bees, such as woodruff, the team may be able to increase production to a feasible scale. \"We're looking at growing those plants in various areas around Cardiff, including one on the roof of the St David's Shopping Centre, which already has its own bee hives,\" he explained. The university is looking for teams of students to produce and market the product. However, Mr Hickman, 55, a nurse, has a less scientific theory about what made his honey so powerful. \"My personal opinion is it was our low-intervention approach (to beekeeping). \"I don't get any honey more than a couple of times a year, I don't dictate what the bees are doing, I don't interfere with the hives like a lot of modern beekeepers do.\" The university's project set out to find plant-based sources for drugs capable of fighting antibiotic-resistant infections, asking beekeepers from across Wales to send samples. Honey has been used for thousands of years to treat sore throats, wounds and infections, due to its bacteria-killing compounds. But the antimicrobial activity of any particular honey depends on the properties of the plants visited by the bees which made it. Cardiff University and the National Botanic Garden of Wales, in Llanarthne, Carmarthenshire, sequenced samples from 20 honeys with the highest antibacterial qualities and identified the plants which contributed. Prof Baillie said it was only possible because Wales was among the first countries to DNA barcode all of its indigenous flowering plants - 1,143 of them. The team now hopes both to extract the antimicrobial components from these plants and to synthesize them in labs.

{"article": "In their only head-to-head TV debate, centre-left candidate Peer Steinbrueck called her euro policies a failure. But Mrs Merkel pointed to Germany's healthy economy, calling it \"the motor of growth\" in Europe. The event was seen as Mr Steinbrueck's biggest chance to claw back Mrs Merkel's lead in the opinion polls. The chancellor's conservative coalition is reckoned to be leading Mr Steinbrueck's Social Democrats (SPD) by around 15 points (40% to 25%). By Stephen EvansBBC News, Berlin Bread-and-butter economic issues dominated more than an hour of the 90-minute debate.  Chancellor Merkel portrayed herself as someone the voters knew and could trust - a safe pair of hands in difficult times. On the other hand, SPD candidate Peer Steinbrueck emphasised what he saw as the cost of success to ordinary people -  a low pay sector \"like hardly any other country in Europe\". Who won? Instant polls after the event were pretty evenly split, some giving Angela Merkel the edge. What is certain is that neither person delivered a knock-out punch that radically changed the course of the campaign.  Chancellor Merkel went into the debate with overwhelming approval, and that position is unlikely to have been completely reversed. However, even with those figures, Mrs Merkel would still need a coalition partner, meaning the outcome of the election remains uncertain. With three weeks to go before the 22 September vote, the two candidates were grilled by four journalists before an estimated TV audience of up to 20 million. Mr Steinbrueck, who was Mrs Merkel's finance minister in the 2005-09 \"grand coalition\" between left and right, attacked her handling of the European debt crisis. \"I would have followed a different crisis strategy. Of course there must be budget consolidation in these countries, but not a deadly dose,\" he said. \"Germany once got help too and we must not forget that. Germany was massively helped after the Second World War with the Marshall Plan.\" \"You voted for everything,\" Mrs Merkel retorted, pointing out that the SPD had supported her policies in parliament. Mr Steinbrueck said Germany had the biggest low-pay sector in Europe, and that he wanted to ensure greater \"social justice,\" by introducing a national minimum wage and higher taxes for the biggest earners. The chancellor said Germany had more people in work than ever. \"We must not do anything to put jobs at risk and the tax hike plans of the Social Democrats and the Greens bring with them the risk that we spoil the good situation that we have instead of improving it.\" So far, there have been few campaign issues that have exposed major policy differences between the two figures and the parties have focused on their personalities. Mr Steinbrueck is often witty but prone to gaffes, while Mrs Merkel often seems less than comfortable in the cut and thrust of live debate, the BBC's Berlin correspondent Stephen Evans reports. A snap poll for Germany's RTL television declared Merkel a narrow winner of the debate, while an ARD TV poll suggested Mr Steinbrueck had been more convincing. However, Mr Steinbrueck did not appear to land the sort of knock-out blow that would change the course of the campaign, our correspondent says. The leaders of the smaller parties taking part in the election will have their own election debate on Monday. Mr Steinbrueck, 66, has said he will not enter a grand coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats. He would prefer to go into coalition with the Green Party, while Mrs Merkel is hoping to continue her governing alliance with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP). However, the FDP has lost much of its support since the last election, and if it does poorly Mrs Merkel and Mr Steinbrueck may be forced to work together.", "question": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's main rival in this month 's election has @placeholder her of causing misery by imposing austerity on southern Europe .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "intensified", "option_2": "continued", "option_3": "defended", "option_4": "accused", "label": 4}

{"article": "Emily Bushaway \"turned blue\" after part of her ventilator, known as a whisper valve, was seemingly discarded at Helen & Douglas House in Oxford. Her father Mark Greener said he noticed the part was missing when he came to take her home. Coroner Darren Salter recorded a narrative verdict. He concluded staff had not been suitably trained in invasive ventilation and were unfamiliar with the valve. He said the serious risks were not adequately highlighted in the patient's care plan, so her accidental death was contributed to by neglect. The coroner also recommended the hospice improve areas of training in ventilators. Ms Bushaway, who was from Letchworth, was having several days of respite care in May 2016. She was diagnosed at six years old with the neuro-degenerative condition Niemann-Pick disease type C. Mr Greener told the inquest her ventilator was attached directly to a plastic breathing tube connected to her windpipe. Its whisper valve needed washing and changing daily, and allowed Ms Bushaway's body to get rid of carbon dioxide. Mr Greener explained the ventilator was hooked up to a screen which displayed a \"no-flow\" alarm. The court heard that on 14 May its message log showed the alarm had been triggered three times in 13 minutes. Shortly after, Mr Greener arrived to find his daughter in her wheelchair looking \"awful\" with blue fingernails and lips. He told the inquest: \"They [the staff] were woeful. I walked in there and they were standing there doing nothing.\" A post-mortem examination found Ms Bushaway died of \"severe respiratory compromise due to a failure of the ventilator function\". The family's lawyer, Tim Deeming, said: \"Such a tragic, avoidable death has understandably shocked the whole family.

Being too busy, not enjoying reading or spending time online were all blamed for reading less. Men also tended to be slower readers and less likely to finish books. Of those questioned about their reading habits, 63% of men said they did not read as much as they thought they should, with 46% saying they now read fewer books now than they did in the past. However, one in five men also confessed to pretending they had read a specific title, in order to appear more intelligent. Researchers from OnePoll spoke to 2,000 British men and women ahead of World Book Night on 23 April, when volunteers gift hundreds of thousands of free books to \"reluctant readers\" in their communities. \"We know reading is really important, so we've got to get more people in general, particularly men, to pick up a book,\" said Sue Wilkinson, CEO of the Reading Agency, which commissioned the survey. \"It seems that men recognise the value of reading books but admit that they don't do it as much as they might for several reasons. \"TV shows and films, and the internet, are competing for people's time these days, especially that of young men, and our focus is to remind them of the pleasure that can be derived from reading a book as well,\" she said. A third of men in the study said they preferred to spend their spare time using the internet, while 30% engaged more with film and TV. Organisers said this year's World Book Night was focusing on targeting men to \"show them what they are missing\".

{"article": "Team Sky's Mikel Landa broke clear on the race to the summit finish to win stage 19 but the drama was behind him. Tom Dumoulin, who had led since winning stage 10, cracked on the final climb, and his 31-second advantage evaporated. The Dutchman is 38 seconds adrift of Quintana and five ahead of third-placed Vincenzo Nibali but Sunday's final stage time trial will favour Dumoulin. Movistar's Quintana, the 2014 Giro champion, immediately warned that the 100th edition of the three-week race was \"far from over\" and that he had to try and \"take more time\" from Dumoulin on Saturday's \"decisive\" final day in the mountains. Italy's defending champion Nibali, who rides for Bahrain-Merida, agreed, saying: \"We have to give it everything, we have to take as many seconds as possible before the time trial.\" Stage 20 features two big ascents as the riders tackle a 190km route from Pordenone to Asiago and 27-year-old Quintana and Nibali, 32, are more accomplished climbers than Dumoulin. Sunday's final stage is a largely flat 29.3km time trial from Monza to Milan and 26-year-old Dumoulin is expected to comfortably beat his rivals in the race against the clock. Sunweb team leader Dumoulin, who is trying to become the first Dutchman to win the Giro, won the time trial on stage 10, completing the 39.8km course more than three minutes quicker than Quintana and more than two minutes clear of Nibali. Friday's winner Landa rode solo over the finish line after two near misses earlier in the race. The Spaniard has twice been beaten in the final metres of a stage this week but he made sure on stage 19, riding clear from the breakaway in the final 10km of the climb to Piancavallo. Landa leads the King of the Mountains classification after taking victory from Rui Costa by one minute 49 seconds. Orica's British rider Adam Yates finished in a group alongside Quintana, more than eight minutes behind Landa, to move up to eighth in the overall standings.

The bear was circling Patel when officials found the student's body. Police killed the bear at the scene. As many as 2,400 bears live in the forests of northern New Jersey. The state has one of the highest black-bear densities in the nation but no human has been killed by a bear since 1852, Reuters news agency reports. Any bear attacks on humans are unusual, experts say. \"It is definitely rare,\" said Lawrence Hajna, the state's environmental protection department spokesman. Patel and his friends were hiking in the preserve on Sunday when they saw the bear following them. The group split up but when they regrouped, Patel was missing. His friends called the police and his body was found two hours later. West Milford Police Chief Timothy Storbeck said the approximately 300 pound (136kg) male bear was about 40 yards (37m) from the body and would not leave when officers tried to scare it away. In a statement, Rutgers University, which Patel attended, confirmed he was a final year student of information technology. \"As we grieve over his tragic passing, please know that our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and loved ones, and to all his friends and fellow students at Rutgers,\" the university's chancellor, Richard Edwards, said. Kelcey Burguess, leader of the state's black bear project, said the bear could have been predisposed to attack but more likely was looking for food, as wildlife officials believe there is a shortage of acorns and berries.

{"article": "A record 40% of US homes with children relied on mothers as their main or only source of income, a Pew survey found. Of the women supporting their families, 37% were married women who earned more than their husbands, while 63% were single mothers, the report said. In the 1960s, just 11% of families were supported primarily by mothers. According to the Pew report, married women with a higher income than their husbands tended to be older, white and college-educated. They were likely to earn much more than single mothers, who on average tended to be younger, more likely to be black or Hispanic, and less likely to have attended an institution of higher education. For married women, the median total family income was almost $80,000 (Â£53,000) compared to the median income of $23,000 for the families of single mothers. In the US about one-quarter of all households are headed by a single mother and women make up nearly half the national workforce. According to the study, which was based on census data, the employment rate among married women rose from 37% in 1968 to 65% in 2011. The authors of the Pew Research Center report said it was unclear if the financial crisis had an effect on the trends. But the study noted that since 2007, more women have said they wanted to work full time and fewer said they would prefer not to work at all. The study also said that women's growing role in the workforce remained divisive. While women in the workforce bring clear financial benefits to their families, the study said three-quarters of adults said it was harder to raise children if their mothers worked, and half said it was harder for marriage to succeed under those circumstances.

The Metropolitan Police recorded the highest number of assaults in the UK between 2010 and 2014. The force said it had officers trained to help male victims of sexual assault. More on this story and other news from London A report called Silent Suffering has highlighted a number of concerns, specifically that men felt less able than women to report being victims of sexual assault and rape to police. It says this is due to \"a multitude of social, procedural and emotional barriers\" which prevent male victims from coming forward and being referred to support services. The London-based charity Survivors UK which helps male victims of sex abuse, had its funding cut by the mayor's office in March. A spokesman for the mayor's office for policing and crime said it was due to hold a special conference next week to improve services for all victims, including men, of sexual assault and rape. Mrs Badenoch has called for Boris Johnson to host a summit and develop a strategy to specifically assist male victims of sexual offences. One proposal put forward in the Silent Suffering report is that Boris Johnson should lobby the government to amend the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to include male victims, as has been done in the US. At present, a woman cannot in law \"rape\" a man owing to the definition of the crime. The Metropolitan Police said it was aware that rape remained \"significantly under-reported... not least by male victims\". The force added it is working with relevant support agencies to increase reporting. Rape victim John Lennon was violently attacked in his Manchester home by a man he allowed to stay as a guest for a few days. He said the attack left him needing plastic surgery to repair scarring to his face and his genitals. \"I was in and out of consciousness,\" he said. \"I got away after hitting him over the head with a hammer. \"I ran, I went to a local park and hid in the bushes.\" Mr Lennon said he was so traumatised by the attack it took him 48 hours to report the crime to police.

PEN president Andrew Solomon said: \"The defence of people murdered for their exercise of free speech is at the heart of what PEN stands for. \"Charlie Hebdo's current staff have persisted, and tonight's award reflects their refusal to accept the curtailment of lawful speech through violence.\" Charlie Hebdo's editor in chief, Gerard Biard and Jean-Baptiste Thoret, a film critic who arrived late for work on the day of the attack, were at the gala to accept the award. Mr Thoret has rejected any comparison between the Paris and Dallas attacks. \"To be honest, I can imagine the kind of comparison you can make between the Charlie Hebdo attack of January 7 and this event, but there is nothing. There is no comparison, absolutely no comparison,\"  he told PBS's Charlie Rose. The film critic added that the attack in Texas was part on an \"anti-Islamic movement\" in the US. The decision to award the magazine the Freedom of Expression Courage Award to Charlie Hebdo caused six high-profile authors to withdraw, including The English Patient writer Michael Ondaatje.

The town is a little sanctuary for water voles, with several populations that live around a brook that runs next to the car park of a local supermarket. I went to meet @VoleWriter (better known as Kate Long) to see if she could help me spot one. We stood together on the small pedestrian bridge over the brook and waited. And while we waited a stream of shoppers came up to ask if we were vole spotting. It's clear the people of Whitchurch are big water vole fans and proud of their large local population. The stream through the supermarket car park is perfect water vole territory. A sandy bottom to the water, soft banks to burrow into and plenty of vegetation to eat. But it has one other major advantage, according to Kate. She thinks the local mink prefer the linear habitat of the nearby canal which bypasses Whitchurch. So with almost no mink to worry about, the population on this brook has boomed. They don't seem at all bothered by the cars and shoppers they live next to. After a short while, Kate pointed out something furry and brown running along the edge of the water. It was my first wild water vole sighting! They're much rounder than a brown rat, more like a guinea pig size and shape. It was a brilliant moment for me (although we didn't catch it on our camera sadly, so on Midlands Today we'll be relying on Kate's excellent footage).

{"article": "It also devastated the burgeoning live music scene in Northern Ireland. Forty years later, the Miami Showband massacre remains one of the darkest atrocities of the Troubles. Lead singer Fran O'Toole, guitarist Tony Geraghty and trumpeter Brian McCoy  were shot dead on a country road after a gig in Banbridge, County Down. Singer Des Lee and guitarist Stephen Travers survived the tragedy despite being shot. The massacre was carried out by paramilitary group the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), who had planned to load a bomb on to the bus and have it explode as the band drove south to Dublin. It was the first time musicians had been deliberately targeted by a terrorist group in Northern Ireland and it shocked everyone in all genres of the Irish music scene. Fr Brian D'Arcy was a fan and a friend of The Miami Showband musicians and unofficial chaplain to the showband community. A huge showband fan, he would attend up to 40 dances a week. \"Before the massacre, bands played anywhere and everywhere,\" he says. \"The only time they thought about where they were and who they were playing to was when they asked the dancehall owner which national anthem to play at the end of the evening. \"Showbands were composed of members from north and south, Protestant and Catholic. \"The Miami was a good example - three of them from the north and three from the south. Three Presbyterian, one Church of Ireland and two Roman Catholics.\" Fr D'Arcy admits the showband era was nearing the end in the mid-1970s, but says the \"heart went completely out of the community after the massacre\". \"In its heyday, there were maybe 600 showbands touring Ireland. At the end of the 1970s there were less than 100,\" he says. \"After what happened to the Miami it was hard to get any bands to come to Northern Ireland. \"The bands didn't feel safe, the fans didn't feel safe. No one felt safe.\" Journalist and former band manager Colin McClelland says the Miami Showband massacre had a \"devastating effect on the whole live music scene in Northern Ireland\". \"Some Northern Ireland-based bands still attempted to travel in areas with which they were familiar,\" he says. \"But almost all of the southern-based bands - and there were many - stopped travelling to gigs in the north. \"With a few exceptions, the bands felt that the risk had now become too great to continue and many rural showband venues closed down altogether. \"Most British rock bands immediately took Belfast off their UK tour itineraries because of the publicity surrounding the massacre. \"Only those with an affinity to Northern Ireland, such as Rory Gallagher, insisted upon Belfast remaining on their tour schedule. Blues and jazz musician Ronnie Greer was in his 20s when the massacre took place. He began his musical career in a showband - The Secrets - where he played alongside Miami member Brian McCoy. After the massacre, he continued playing live, but with a new awareness of the risks involved. \"It was Brian who gave me my first job in a band,\" he says. \"I was only in my late teens and had secured an audition. Brian collected me and I told him how much I wanted the job. \"He told me not to worry - it was already mine. \"However, he added that he would only be around for a few months as he had got a full-time job with the Miami Showband. \"When I heard about the massacre, I couldn't drive. I had to get out of the car and sit on the bonnet for 15 minutes. \"I still get upset about it. \"Brian was a very enthusiastic and cheerful guy and was over-the-moon at being able to give up his job in the Spinning Mill in Belfast and become a full-time musician.\" Ronnie had moved on to jazz and blues when the massacre happened, but he admits that what happened affected the whole music community in Ireland. \"Up until then, all musicians enjoyed a free pass - we weren't targets for any organisation and we had no bother travelling anywhere,\" he says. \"We started thinking about security more, how safe it was to go somewhere â€¦ however, we still played. \"Maybe it was the arrogance of youth that made us believe it couldn't happen to us, or maybe it was an act of defiance, but the music was the most important thing.\" Gerry McWhinney was also a member of the Secrets and knew the Miami Showband members well. \"Brian was on trumpet and vocals with the Secrets and I was on bass,\" he says. \"We knew the Miami through doing warm up for them before Big Band nights. \"Like Brian they were young, talented, professional and ambitious musicians. \"The Miami management team arrived unannounced one night, listened to the Secrets and offered Brian a place. \"In today's terms it was like being offered One Direction or Take That. \"The massacre shocked us all. We thought showbands were surrounded by a protective veil as we travelled at night, and we just could not believe what had happened. \"It was a shocking blow. There was a dullness for a long time afterwards. \"However, we played on.

{"article": "When Peter Young was in charge of mental health services at Australia's refugee detention centres, he says it became increasingly clear that authorities wanted to \"keep the lid\" on health issues that asylum seekers were experiencing. The senior Australian psychiatrist says immigration authorities wanted details about the high rates of mental illness among children at the centres to be removed from his official reports. He was asked to delete clinical opinions that made a direct link between prolonged detention and mental health problems. Dr Young was director of International Health and Medical Services (IHMS) - a private health service contracted by Australia's Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) to provide health care to detention centres - a role he held for three years. Its services covered the country's controversial offshore facilities on the Pacific island of Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, where all asylum seekers who try to reach Australia by boat are sent - never to be resettled in Australia even if their refugee claims are proven. In advising on treatment, Dr Young argued with authorities who considered acts of self-harm by detainees as \"a type of bad behaviour, rather than a manifestation of people in extreme states of hopelessness\". He says he was later refused permission to use data he had collected about health issues in detention centres in presentations or publications. \"They made it very clear this type of information should never get into the public domain,\" he told the BBC. Now there is fear that health workers could go to prison for such revelations under new Border Force laws that threaten \"entrusted people\" with up to two years in prison if they reveal protected information about Australia's detention facilities. In recent months, hundreds of doctors and nurses have staged public protests in cities across Australia, posing with their hands over their mouths to highlight the risk of being silenced. Their concerns are shared by Australia's 13 peak medical groups, who have accused the government of trying to \"gag\" health professionals. The World Medical Association has also warned the laws are \"in striking conflict with basic principles of medical ethics\". Critics say the gag is the latest act in a \"culture of secrecy\" around tough Australian policies designed to stop boatloads of asylum seekers from arriving on Australian shores. The government is unapologetic about its stance on \"stopping the boats\" It denies it is trying to silence doctors and nurses or that it wants to suppress health information. The Border Force says the new laws are to protect \"operational security\" and insists robust internal mechanisms are in place through which medical concerns can be raised and addressed. The federal Labor opposition agrees. It supported the legislation and says health workers will be protected by 'whistleblower' protections under the Commonwealth Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013. However, legal experts say it is not clear what sort of information would be protected and there are a range of internal hurdles that could delay or deter disclosures. That confusion alone may suit the government, says human rights lawyer George Newhouse. \"I think the government is very happy with the uncertainty around the laws and how they are likely to have a 'chilling effect' on potential whistleblowers,\" he told the BBC. Given very restricted public access to Australian detention centres, health and social workers have been key sources of information about conditions. Two former medical officers at the Christmas Island detention facility, last year graphically catalogued a range of health concerns in an article in the Medical Journal of Australia, saying, among other things, that \"degrading, harmful and inappropriate incidents\" had occurred at the centre. \"Degrading, harmful and inappropriate incidents have occurred, including requiring asylum seekers to undergo health assessments while exhausted, dehydrated and filthy, with clothing soiled by urine and faeces; addressing individuals by number instead of name, artificial delays in transfer of patients for tertiary care; confiscation and destruction of medications, medical records and medical devices; and detention of children despite clear evidence of significant harm.\" --Medical Journal of Australia, Volume 201, October 2014 Dr Young believes the risk of being sent to prison will discourage medical staff from speaking out in future, even if no prosecutions are launched. Other detention centre practices like employing staff from developing countries who are not protected by Australian labour or whistleblower laws also \"keep the lid on all information flowing out of the system\", he says. \"My position is that the medical profession is expected to speak out when it comes to issues that harm people's health. \"There would be no controversy if I was speaking about cigarette smoking or asbestos exposure. \"The evidence is very clear that prolonged detention in such circumstances causes a negative health impact, and keeping those health impacts secret makes the situation worse.\" Marie McInerney is a Melbourne-based writer.", "question": "Australian laws @placeholder people working in the country 's detention centres from speaking out about what they see have raised grave concerns in the medical community .", "option_0": "offers", "option_1": "welcome", "option_2": "forbidding", "option_3": "believes", "option_4": "hopes", "label": 2}

Six with possible African ancestry is the first evidence of migrants from the continent in the city, experts said. Leicester is one of the UK's most diverse cities, with half its population described as white British compared to 80% nationally. African Romans in Britain: Your questions answered For more archaeology stories follow our Pinterest board Mathew Morris, project supervisor, said it showed Leicester's multiculturalism was not confined to recent decades. The remains, dating between the 2nd and 4th Century, were discovered during a series of excavations between 2010 and 2015 at a former factory site in Western Road. However, the university said some bodies were buried with grave goods or exhibit burial customs not previously seen in the city. Mr Morris said six had African cranial features but \"excitingly\" two of them, one a child, appear to have been born in England. He said by studying their teeth the team was able to tell what type of water they drank and where in the country it originated. Through this process, known as isotope analysis, they can chart migration. The archaeologist said one of the people was probably born in the Pennines area and the other in Leicester itself. He said there are a number of theories why they were in Leicester including for trade or military reasons. Skeletons of African origin, dating from the same period, have been found in York and at Hadrian's Wall, but this is the first evidence in Leicester. During the excavations an elaborately decorated belt was found which would have been worn by a late Roman soldier or civil servant.

The invited audience in Yangon was told censors thought it damaged the army's image and national reconciliation. The army still wields huge influence despite Myanmar's civilian government. It is guaranteed at least 25% of the seats in parliament, controls key parts of the economy and built the civil service to service its interests over five decades of military rule. Speaking to the BBC, the Film Classification Board's deputy director general Daw Thida Tin said the film had been banned for the sake of \"national unity and also the stability of the country and of our people\". Organisers say they were also told that the censors saw the film as damaging to the image of the army. Censorship of print media was lifted as part of a series of democratic reforms in the last few years in Myanmar (also called Burma), but films still have to be approved by the censor board. It is part of Myanmar's Ministry of Information but its decisions do not need the minister's approval. Twilight Over Burma tells the true story of an Austrian woman Inge Eberhard (now Sargent) who fell in love and married a Burmese prince from the Shan ethnic group. The film shows how their exotic life in the hills of Shan State is destroyed by Burma's military coup of 1962. Ms Eberhard's husband Sao Kya Seng ends up being detained by the army before dying in mysterious circumstances. Mon Mon Myat the director of the festival said the decision showed the new government was \"new wine but in the old bottles\" - a reference to the limits on the power of the government lead by Aung San Suu Kyi. Replying rapidly to news stories is not one of the elected administration's strengths.

In a highly unusual move, the jury's verdict was delivered at midnight following a unanimous decision in the month-long trial. Earlier this year, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, who has previously ruled out allowing any political leader to be prosecuted for alleged war crimes, said he was concerned that naval and military commanders had been summoned before the courts. Raviraj's death was seen as a setback for moderates in Sri Lanka and led to thousands of people marching in Colombo in protest at the murder. Raviraj, who was fluent in Tamil, Sinhala and English, acted as a bridge between communities and spoke out against extreme nationalists. He was shot as he left his house in Colombo for work. Sri Lanka's army defeated separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009 after 26 years of civil war. The death toll as a result of the conflict is estimated to be more than 70,000.

Average store prices fell for the eighth consecutive month, falling by 3.6% in February 2015 compared with a year earlier. The largest contribution to the drop in prices came from the slide in fuel prices, which fell more than 15% over the year to February 2015. The ONS's statistics measure sales volumes, or changes in the number of items sold each month. The amount spent also grew in February, up by 0.3% compared with January and 2.2% higher than a year earlier. Non-food stores saw the biggest increase in sales by volume, in particular household goods which the ONS said was a lagging effect of last year's improvement in house sales, as people furnished and decorated their new homes. Online sales increased in volume by 10.1%, but the value of online transactions fell by 2.3%. The steady increase in retail sales adds to the picture of a recovering UK economy, but will in turn fuel concerns that growth is too reliant on shoppers. \"Although these figures are good news and will strengthen confidence, we must remember that the UK's economic growth remains unbalanced and is too reliant on consumer spending,\" said David Kern, Chief Economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. \"UK exporters are still facing huge challenges, particularly in the eurozone, which is our largest trading partner.\" The previous month's figures were also revised upwards.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he would continue to take \"necessary action\" to address livelihood issues and keep Japan's economy on track. The stepped tax increases are aimed at covering rising social welfare costs linked to Japan's ageing population. Japan currently has one of the lowest birth rates in the world. It also has the world's highest ratio of elderly to young people, raising serious concerns about future economic growth. The last hike in 1997 saw Japan's consumption tax - the equivalent of VAT (value-added tax) or sales tax - rise to 5% from 3%. Almost immediately afterwards, Japan plunged into a deep recession with a lasting impact: the country has struggled to escape the trap of deflation, or decreasing prices, almost yearly every since. A tax increase has been discussed in Japan for several years, but it has always been perceived as highly unpopular with the electorate. The current rise is expected to present a challenge to Mr Abe's aim of forcing Japan's economy out of deflation and serial recession. Separate data on Tuesday indicated that those concerns are shared by the business community. The results of the Tankan survey, which polls more than 10,500 Japanese companies about their business outlook, indicated that Japanese firms were not optimistic about the rest of the year. However, analysts say Japan's economy will have a better chance of surviving the tax rise this time round. \"Everybody was extremely worried because of the bad impact of the last hike, but this time it seems to be widely accepted,\" Martin Schulz, an analyst at Fujitsu Research Institute, told the BBC. \"Demand is strong and it will not drop that much as many have been fearing.\"", "question": "Japan has raised its consumption tax for the first time in 17 years in an @placeholder to rein in public debt .", "option_0": "essential", "option_1": "attempt", "option_2": "apparent", "option_3": "effort", "option_4": "initiative", "label": 1}

He is considering plans drawn up by Finance Wales, the government-owned investment agency, to create the bank. Opposition AMs called for more details and said his announcement was a \"rebrand\" of Finance Wales. Mr Skates said the business case for the bank was still in a draft form, but he would publish it in the New Year after the Welsh Government has gathered more feedback. Two options for basing the bank in north Wales are being considered, one of which would cost Â£5m, he told the Senedd on Tuesday. Finance Wales is currently based in Cardiff. The bank is on course to launch in the first half of 2017 if approved by regulators and would have a target of investing Â£80m a year by 2022. It would address \"market failures\" where businesses - in particular small and micro-businesses, and new start-ups - are not able to borrow money from private banks. Although things had improved since the credit crunch, some small businesses were still struggling to get funding, Mr Skates said. The bank will not compete with private-sector lenders, but will instead provide \"top-up finance\" to help companies grow. \"I am also challenging the bank to continuously improve its value for money, and work towards ambitious private sector leverage to reduce cost per job,\" Mr Skates added. Welsh Conservative economy spokesman Russell George said Mr Skates's statement was a \"cosmetic rebrand of Finance Wales\" - something the minister denied, saying the Development Bank reflected calls from AMs to build on Finance Wales' experience and expertise. Plaid Cymru shadow economy minister Adam Price said: \"It's a step forward, but I don't think it's quite as radical or as transformative as it could have been.\" A review written in 2013 by business expert Prof Dylan Jones-Evans questioned whether Finance Wales was doing enough to help the Welsh economy and recommended the creation of a development bank. In October, it emerged that a subsidiary company of Finance Wales, FW Capital, was competing for work in the UK government's Northern Powerhouse project. Mr Price said at the time that FW Capital's activities in England could conflict with the aim of helping businesses in Wales. On Tuesday, Mr Skates said he recognised \"this was something of a controversial issue\", but that FW's activity in England would continue.

After being informed of the malware, Apple revoked the developers' certificate on the infected software to prevent it from being installed if people downloaded it. Transmission's developers released a new version of their software and added a notice on their website, urging customers to upgrade immediately. Apple's Mac operating system - Mac OS X - has traditionally been considered to be a secure system because it is more locked down than the myriad of devices running Windows operating systems. While writing malware code for Macs is more difficult because there is less of it around, as the computers become more commonly used criminals are working harder to target them, Greg Day, Palo Alto Networks' chief security officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa told the BBC. \"In all honesty unfortunately this is a likely outcome,\" he said of his team's discovery. \"There is a simple reality which is criminals will follow us as users of IT to generate ransom. \"We've seen more Mac threats in the last few years - it's a very good reminder that there is no environment which is risk free from cyber attack.\"", "question": "A type of malware that locks computer files and demands a fee for their release has @placeholder targeted Apple computers .", "option_0": "lost", "option_1": "abruptly", "option_2": "exceeded", "option_3": "developed", "option_4": "successfully", "label": 4}
{"article": "The failings came to light in a report about a severely disabled boy who went without speech and language therapy for two years. The boy's family had to complain twice to the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) before they were given help. The council has apologised to the family and is now supporting the boy. The boy, who has not been named in the report, has severe complex speech, language, communication, sensory and physical needs. He also had a Special Educational Needs or Disabilities (SEN) statement in place, which means he is legally entitled to specialised support. The family's first complaint to the LGO in 2015 was upheld. But after a tribunal ordered more support for the boy, the family was forced to complain a second time as support was still not in place. The Ombudsman's report said the council's children's services had \"showed a level of ineptitude in funding, commissioning and delivering a statutory service\". This led to \"vulnerable and disabled children missing out on the support they require\", it added. Dr Jane Martin, from the LGO, said: \"At the heart of this case is a vulnerable young disabled boy who has been left without the support he needs to help him make friends and get on with his lessons.\" Somerset County Council has paid the family Â£300 for having to complain twice and Â£1,000 for the boy's educational benefit. A council spokesman said: \"Our sincerest apologies have been extended to the family and we have continued to work alongside them to find the appropriate therapy for their son. \"We're happy that this has now been resolved and that additional therapy sessions took place throughout the summer.\" It also said lessons had been learned in commissioning therapies for the 3,000 children it looks after. During the investigation, the LGO also found two more Somerset families who were affected by delays.

{"article": "Playing with the density of hair removed altered how serious an injury the body recognised and in turn how much hair regrew. The team managed to regenerate 1,300 hairs by plucking 200, in the study using mice reported in Cell journal. Experts said it was \"really nice science\" but were uncertain if it could lead to a cure for human baldness. Half of men have male-pattern baldness by the age of 50. The team at the University of Southern California were investigating how hair follicles communicate with each other to decide on the scale of repair job needed. In a series of experiments they removed 200 hair follicles from a circular patch of skin in mice. A low-density pluck - removing follicles from a patch 6mm in diameter - led to no regeneration at all. A medium-density pluck, with 200 removed from a 5mm circle, led to 1,300 new hairs. A higher-density effort, with the same number of hairs but from a 4mm diameters circle, led to 780 new hairs. Pulling every hair out led to every hair coming back, but no extra regeneration. The researchers showed that the level of inflammation under the skin was finely tuned to the scale of the damage. And through a cascade of chemical signalling and immune responses, this controlled the amount of regeneration. The team say it is like each hair gets a vote about what happens next and when it reaches a critical threshold it can trigger regeneration. They call the concept \"quorum sensing\". Lead researcher Dr Cheng-Ming Chuong said: \"It is a good example of how basic research can lead to work with potential translational value. \"The work leads to potential new targets for treating alopecia, a form of hair loss.\" Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, told the BBC: \"It's a really nice piece of science. The idea of quorum sensing is smart.\" But it is not known whether it will cure human baldness. Prof Mason added: \"That's the million-dollar question. I'm not sure. As it stands here, you've got to have some hair to pluck. \"A lot of studies have produced hair, but it's too fine - it's baby hair, it's light-coloured and it just doesn't look right.

{"article": "The Emirates Arena hosts the World Badminton Championships from 21-27 August. And Badminton Scotland chief executive Anne Smillie is convinced the event will help develop the sport and unearth the next Scottish badminton stars. \"It's crucial to the development of sport that a governing body stages major events,\" she told BBC Scotland. \"It raises the profile of the sport, exposure on TV and in the media brings opportunities to see athleticism and to showcase the best stars in the world taking part in your sport. And that also gives people the opportunity to, not only play the sport, but also to come and watch and that's so important.\" Badminton Scotland is making a conscious effort to ensure the event grabs the attention of youngsters. Over the week while the championships are running, badminton festivals will run alongside the event. In total, 7,000 children will attend the Big Hit festivals, and each will be given a free badminton racket. Smillie reflected on how former Scotland internationals Susan Egelstaff and Imogen Bankier were inspired by similar events taking place in Scotland, going from spectators to world class players, winning Commonwealth and world medals. Bankier won a silver medal at the World Championships when she reached the mixed doubles final with England's Chris Adcock in London six years ago. Glasgow hosted the World Championships in 1997 and World Team Championships in 2007. In hosting this year's World Championships, Glasgow have something in common with Copenhagen, Jakarta and Birmingham as the only cities to have hosted the individual World Championships on more than one occasion. And another former Scotland and Great Britain international reveals he too was motivated by Glasgow's last hosting of the World Championships. Commonwealth bronze medallist Robert Blair has fond memories of that 1997 event and says it inspired him to become the player he did. \"Twenty years ago we had the World Championships and I remember being there almost everyday watching and thinking I'd like to be like that one and this one,\" he said. Blair is now part of the coaching staff at Badminton Scotland and hopes those he's now helping on court will gain the same inspiration he did. \"Hopefully the young ones here will see what they can aspire to and it gives them the determination to really train and reach those heights,\" he said. Kirsty Gilmour is already hitting such heights. The Commonwealth silver winner will be competing at the same venue as when she won her Glasgow 2014 medal. And the 23-year-old says the partisan crowd are bound to aid her cause. \"It's such a special occasion being able to play and compete in Glasgow,\" she said. \"Family and friends get to come and watch, which really doesn't happen very often, and after the Commonwealth Games I feel a little bit spoiled that I get another huge championships in my home city. \"The Glaswegian and Scottish support is amazingly relentless and I think that was a huge factor in what I was able to do in the Commonwealth Games and get that silver medal. I love any opportunity to play in front of people who are on my side as it doesn't happen too often.\" Gilmour is seeded 16th for this year's event, receiving a first-round bye, and is in confident mood. \"Right now I feel I'm maybe in the best shape I've ever been in,\" she added. \"I've just come off the back of a good couple of tournaments in North America - the Canadian and then the US Open.

{"article": "Mark Boleat said London would remain a leading financial hub, with only a few banking jobs likely to move. Urging speedy trade talks, he added: \"We would hope that the negotiations go quickly and go well.\" The triggering of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty last month began the two year countdown to the UK's EU exit. Before the referendum, the financial services sector largely backed the Remain campaign, warning that quitting the bloc could spur an exodus of City jobs. The City of London, the council that covers London's financial centre, itself backed EU membership. Since then, banks including Goldman Sachs, HSBC and UBS have said they will move some jobs out of London as a result of Brexit. The historic insurance market Lloyd's of London has announced plans to open a Brussels subsidiary in early 2019. But in an interview with the AFP news agency, Mr Boleat said that while a few people would be moved, \"no one is going to say 'we are closing down in London'\". \"Banks have had contingency plans since before the Brexit referendum in some cases,\" he said. \"They have known there is a possibility that Britain will not be in the single market - that has now been confirmed.\" He said banks would need to \"restructure what they are doing - perhaps cease doing a few things, in some cases build up business elsewhere in the European Union. They are getting on and doing that.\" Mr Boleat also said it was important the UK reached an early agreement over the terms of its exit from the bloc and on the rights of EU nationals. That would minimise disruption to \"business and consumers in this country - and in Europe,\" he said. On Friday, the Bank of England governor warned of sector-wide consequences if the UK left without a trade deal. Mark Carney said the \"vast majority\" of City firms already had contingency plans in place. However, he said some financial firms still needed to prepare in case of a \"more extreme\" outcome.

The Kenyan military has denied the claim but has not come up with its own casualty figures. The bodies of four soldiers killed in the fighting were repatriated to the capital, Nairobi, on Monday night. At least 20 soldiers have so far returned home, some critically wounded.

{"article": "\"I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it. I will have it all mine.\" Henry V's words may be Shakespeare's invention but they sum up neatly the events of my chosen year. On 21 May, in a treaty sealed in the city of Troyes, the kings of England were recognised by the French king, Charles VI, as the rightful inheritors of the throne of France. Once Charles died, England and France would have the same king in perpetuity. The treaty laid down that all divisions, hatreds and wars between the two realms and their peoples should cease, and be replaced by peace, affection, mutual agreement and stable friendship forever more. The history of Europe thenceforward would have surely been quite different had this treaty proved longer-lasting. At first everything seemed to be in its favour. The closeness of the kingdoms was reinforced by Henry's marriage to Charles's daughter, Katherine, a fortnight later. Within 18 months she had done her queenly duty by giving birth at Windsor to a son. In the meantime, and in accordance with the treaty, Henry V ruled France as regent for his father-in-law, gaining respect for his good government even from the French, but he died a few weeks before Charles in 1422, leaving the nine-month-old Henry VI as king of the double monarchy of England and France. Even in 1420, however, there were doubts. By accepting Henry V as his heir, Charles had disinherited his own son. Many French doubted that any ruler had the right to disrupt the natural succession. In England, MPs were not certain that the Treaty of Troyes was a good thing. In December they asked for reassurance that England would never be subject to France. Not quite Brexit but close?

{"article": "Last year, Forbes business magazine placed him 58th in its list of the world's most powerful people, comfortably ahead of the leaders of Mexico and Japan, although a few rungs below the head of the Islamic State militant group. But in the light of subsequent events, its account of 68-year-old Mr Winterkorn's achievements appears to foreshadow his downfall. Forbes said at the time that he \"urged European regulators not to overburden the automotive industry with excessive emission targets, citing a lack of time to develop fuel-efficient technology and the economic downturn as major concerns\". The piece went on to say that \"the topic is especially close to [Mr] Winterkorn\". If it wasn't then, observers might say, it certainly is now, given the scandal over the rigging of emissions test results for VW's diesel-powered cars in the US. The VW chief apologised twice over for the deception, even going to the lengths of issuing a video statement in which he said that he was \"utterly sorry\". But it was not enough to save his job, as he was forced to step down just a day later. \"Volkswagen needs a fresh start - also in terms of personnel,\" he said in a statement. \"I am clearing the way for this fresh start with my resignation.\" Mr Winterkorn had been at the helm of Volkswagen since the beginning of 2007, but this year it all turned sour. The emissions crisis that forced him out came just five months after he saw off another challenge to his leadership. On that occasion, however, internal company politics, not external regulators, were at the heart of the matter. For reasons which remain unclear, the company's chairman at the time, Ferdinand Piech, moved against Mr Winterkorn, expressing critical views of him in an interview with Der Spiegel news magazine. Until that point, the two men had been seen as close allies. But according to unconfirmed reports, the bone of contention was the firm's difficulties in cracking the US market - again, a point that appears prophetic when viewed in retrospect. The dispute between the two men caused ructions within the car giant's complex power structure. Mr Piech must have been confident of winning the battle, since he is part of the Porsche family, which controls nearly 51% of VW. But Wolfgang Porsche, a member of the five-strong executive committee and a cousin of Mr Piech, said he had given his \"personal opinion\" without clearing his remarks with other family members. In the end, Mr Piech had to step down after the board gave its backing to Mr Winterkorn, as did trade union leaders and politicians.

On his way up, he became determined to take on all comers, vowing to turn VW into the world's biggest car company, at a time when Toyota and General Motors appeared to be the main contenders. Earlier this year, his wish finally came true when figures for the first half of 2015 showed that VW had outstripped Toyota in global vehicle sales. Now that victory is starting to look hollow.

{"article": "As a prominent campaigner for Britain to leave the EU, it is no surprise that he believes Britain would be in a better position to protect the steel industry if we were not bound by EU rules. Those on the other side of the referendum debate point out that the EU is our most important market for steel, with more than half of our steel exports going to the EU and more than two thirds of our imports coming from it. The EU Commissioner in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager summed up the rules earlier this year. She said: \"EU countries and the Commission have put in place strict safeguards against state aid to rescue and restructure steel companies in difficulty. \"This avoids harmful subsidy races between EU countries and that uncontrolled state aid in one EU country can unfairly put at risk thousands of jobs across the EU\", adding: \"EU state aid rules enable member states to for example support research activities or relieve energy costs of steel companies\". Whilst it is technically true that outside the EU the UK government would be free to nationalise and subsidise the steel industry, it seems highly unlikely that a Conservative government would want to permanently re-nationalise such a loss-making business. Out campaigners and steel industry representatives agree that EU anti-dumping measures are inadequate to prevent the Chinese dumping low-cost steel into the market. The Lesser Duty rule caps tariffs at 9%.  UK Steel, the trade association for the steel industry, says this has little effect when heavily-subsidised Chinese steel is sold at 66% of cost price. Ministers have argued against lifting the cap, saying higher tariffs would hit other sectors such as the car industry. UK Steel does not accept the government's argument on this, pointing out that other EU countries such as France and Germany, which both have important car manufacturers, are in favour of lifting it. If Britain were to leave the EU it would certainly have greater freedom to impose anti-dumping tariffs. But Britain's steel industry is closely tied to the EU - exporting some three million tonnes of steel products last year. Outside the EU, the British steel industry could itself face punishing tariffs, depending on what sort of deal could be negotiated. It is worth noting that many of the measures the steel industry is seeking could be implemented by the British government: lower business rates, a relaxation of carbon emissions targets for heavy manufacturers, more compensation for high energy prices, and a commitment that British steel is used in major construction projects.

The scheme to protect art treasures was not originally due to include Wales but it appears a Welsh Office civil servant had asked Whitehall to reconsider.

However, Welsh Office interest in the scheme appeared to cool, as shown by a letter to the Home Office by civil servant Tony Vinall in which he said the officers who made the original request had now gone. \"Present thought is that, although we do have a few valuable items, we are not really to be compared with the great national 'treasure houses' and it would make more sense for our local custodians to crate their most important possessions and put them in the most suitable sub-basement accommodation,\" he wrote.

He was upset that the reporter, Ryan Lizza, had tweeted about who Mr Scaramucci was dining with. The former Wall Street financier also attacked Trump aide Steve Bannon. The conversation with Mr Lizza was littered with profanity-laced insults directed at Mr Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. Mr Scaramucci later tweeted his regret at the \"colourful language\". He did not deny the nature of the conversation as it was reported but said he \"made a mistake in trusting a reporter\". \"It won't happen again,\" he tweeted. Mr Scaramucci has spent much of his first week in the White House railing against \"leakers\" and hinted in interviews that he thinks the chief of staff is one of them. End of Twitter post  by @Scaramucci End of Twitter post 2 by @Scaramucci \"If Reince wants to explain that he's not a leaker, let him do that,\" he told CNN in a phone interview. President Trump has said that leaks from the White House are a national security threat and must stop. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Mr Scaramucci recently told the BBC he saw Donald Trump as a disruptive president, elected to tear the established order apart. What's more, the newly minted White House communications director appears more than happy to help foment the chaos. In his obscenity-laced interview, he clearly draws battle lines between himself and his White House opponents - Mr Priebus and Mr Bannon, in particular. His comments are going to make it difficult for the Trump administration to operate in any semblance of a normal fashion in its current composition. The problem, however, is that it will be almost impossible to show Mr Scaramucci the door so early in his tenure - it would be a tacit admission the president made a mistake in hiring him. The I-told-you-so's from the Priebus crowd would be deafening. Mr Scaramucci could find some unrelated excuse to bow out - business concerns, perhaps - but that doesn't seem the pugnacious New Yorker's style. The other option is for the West Wing bloodletting to continue. Given that Scaramucci dined with the president and Fox News firebrand Sean Hannity last night, before the latest round of \"disruption\" began, Mr Trump may be A-OK with this. The tensions between two of his top aides appeared to be made public when Mr Scaramucci tweeted on Wednesday night that his government financial disclosure form had been leaked. The tweet, which he subsequently deleted, ended by tagging Mr Priebus' Twitter handle. Mr Priebus, who formerly chaired the Republican National Committee, and former White House spokesman Sean Spicer, had reportedly opposed the hiring of Mr Scaramucci. Mr Spicer announced his resignation on the same day that Mr Scaramucci was hired. \"I don't know if [my relationship with Mr Priebus] is repairable or not,\" said Mr Scaramucci on Thursday. \"That will be up to the president.\" On his first day in the job last week, he told reporters that he and the chief of staff were personal friends who like to \"rough each other up\" once in a while. \"But he's a dear friend,\" he added. Sarah Sanders, the press secretary who reports to Mr Scaramucci, told reporters after the phone tirade surfaced that any apology would have to happen \"personally between them\". \"He used some colourful language that I don't anticipate he'll do again,\" she said of her boss. Ms Sanders had earlier described the nature of the two aides' relationship as \"healthy competition\".

{"article": "The anti-India insurgency that erupted in Kashmir in 1989 has abated over the past decade, but the situation remains fragile and volatile - the Kashmir Valley, in particular, remains beset by simmering unrest. The state is home to about 13 million of the disputed territory's 18 million people; the rest live across the heavily militarised Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. The Kashmir conflict has three main dimensions: The BJP-PDP agreement offers the potential to apply the healing touch to the second and third dimensions. On paper, the two are very unlikely coalition partners. Since its formation in 1951, the BJP has maintained a hardline stance on the Kashmir issue and has stood for the repeal of Article 370 of India's constitution which grants  special autonomous status to the state. The PDP accepts that Kashmir is a part of India but has based its politics on articulating the valley's grievances and aspirations. It has not only defended Article 370 but - given that the state's statutory autonomy has been stripped away since the mid-1950s by integrative measures unilaterally imposed from Delhi - advocated renewed \"self-rule\" for Jammu and Kashmir, plus cross-border ties with Pakistani Kashmir. The PDP has also campaigned on a human rights agenda, especially against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which gives virtually unlimited powers and immunity from prosecution to army personnel in Kashmir. The party also advocates dialogue with pro-independence and pro-Pakistan groups and leaders in Kashmir and with Pakistan to find a lasting solution to the Kashmir conflict. All these demands are at odds with the Hindu nationalist perspective on Kashmir. Last May the BJP, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, won a decisive victory in India's general elections and a majority in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the parliament), the first time this has happened since 1984. In December, Jammu and Kashmir state elections saw a good voter turnout of 65% and threw up a complex, fractured result - the PDP dominated in the valley and emerged as the single-largest party with 28 seats and the BJP was a close second with 25 seats due to a dominating performance in the Jammu region. The formation of the PDP-BJP government - in which Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, a 79-year-old political veteran, and nearly two-thirds of the ministers with full cabinet rank are from the PDP - followed two months of hard negotiations. The talks signalled a hugely positive development: the engagement of the most hardline Indian position on Kashmir with a perspective rooted in the valley which advocates autonomy, dignity and rights. On Article 370, \"while recognising the different positions of the parties\", the coalition agreement commits to maintaining \"all the constitutional provisions pertaining to Kashmir including the special status\". On AFSPA, while noting that the \"[two] parties have historically held different view(s)\", the agreement observes that \"the situation in the state has improved vastly\" and \"the coalition government will thoroughly review the security situation\" and \"the need for de-notifying disturbed areas\" to \"enable the government to take a final view on the continuation of AFSPA in these areas\". Beyond the rapprochement on the most contentious points, the agreement is significant for what it promises to do on a broader front. \"The purpose of this alliance,\" the agreement says, is \"to catalyse reconciliation and confidence-building within and across the LoC\", to \"widen the ambit of democracy through inclusive politics\", and to \"create conditions to facilitate resolution of all issues\". So \"the coalition government will facilitate and help initiate a sustained and meaningful dialogue with all internal stakeholders irrespective of their ideological views... [which] will seek to build a broad-based consensus on the resolution of all outstanding issues\". Further, as \"the government has recently initiated several steps to normalise the relationship with Pakistan, the coalition government will seek to support and strengthen the approach\". And, \"the same [goal] will be pursued by enhancing people-to-people contact across the LoC [through] encouraging civil society exchanges [and by] taking travel, commerce, trade and business across the LoC to the next level\". This is precisely the kind of approach that eventually succeeded in ending the long conflict in Northern Ireland. The symbolism of the oath-taking ceremony of the new Kashmir government - held in Jammu, the state's winter capital and a predominantly Hindu city - was powerful, as Mr Modi and Mr Sayeed embraced behind a table decorated with the Indian flag and the state flag. Hindu nationalists have long objected to Kashmir having its own flag. It is premature to say that this strategic bargain between Kashmiri Muslim regionalists and Hindu nationalists heralds a Kashmir Spring. But it is unmistakably the most hopeful development since the descent into violence a quarter of a century ago. The challenge over the next few years is to convert symbolism into substance, and the promise into reality.

Victorian life was suffused with death. Epidemics such as diphtheria, typhus and cholera scarred the country, and from 1861 the bereaved Queen made mourning fashionable. Trinkets of memento mori - literally meaning \"remember you must die\" - took several forms, and existed long before Victorian times. Locks of hair cut from the dead were arranged and worn in lockets and rings, death masks were created in wax, and the images and symbols of death appeared in paintings and sculptures. But in the mid-1800s photography was becoming increasingly popular and affordable - leading to memento mori photographic portraiture. The first successful form of photography, the daguerreotype - a small, highly detailed picture on polished silver - was an expensive luxury, but not nearly as costly as having a portrait painted, which previously had been the only way of permanently preserving someone's image. As the number of photographers increased, the cost of daguerreotypes fell. Less costly procedures were introduced in the 1850s, such as using thin metal, glass or paper rather than silver. Death portraiture became increasing popular. Victorian nurseries were plagued by measles, diphtheria, scarlet fever, rubella - all of which could be fatal. It was often the first time families thought of having a photograph taken - it was the last chance to have a permanent likeness of a beloved child. But as healthcare improved the life expectancy of children, the demand for death photography diminished. The advent of snapshots sounded the death knell for the art - as most families would have photographs taken in life.

Members were later told Mr Longworth had been temporarily suspended for breaching the group's official position of neutrality, the paper added. Mr Longworth had described the referendum as a choice between the \"devil and the deep blue sea\". One option was staying in an \"essentially unreformed EU\", with the other being the uncertainty of leaving, he told the conference. Mr Longworth added: \"The dynamism and resilience of the City of London and the UK business sector suggests to me that, in the long run, we have the capacity and capability to create a bright, if not brighter, economic future outside of the EU - just as we would have done had we had the opportunity to stay in a truly reformed Europe.\" BCC members will be surveyed so their views could inform the debate ahead of the vote in June, Mr Longworth added. The BCC responded at the time by saying it would not be campaigning for either side and that Mr Longworth's comments \"reflect his personal assessment, rather than the position of the BCC\". Pro-EU campaign group Britain Stronger in Europe said: \"This affair demonstrates that, while some individual businesspeople are campaigning to leave the EU, their views do not come close to representing the clear majority of British businesses - large and small.\"", "question": "The director - @placeholder of the British Chambers of Commerce has been suspended over his personal views on Brexit , according to the Financial Times .", "option_0": "control", "option_1": "version", "option_2": "general", "option_3": "adaptation", "option_4": "era", "label": 2}

The Malaysian Chess Federation told local media the accusation was under investigation. The girl was participating in last month's National Scholastic Chess Championship in Putrajaya, just south of Kuala Lumpur. Afterwards, her coach, Kaushal Khandhar, wrote a long public Facebook post saying an arbiter interrupted her game to tell her she was violating the competition's dress code. \"The tournament director deemed my student's dress to be 'seductive' and a 'temptation from a certain angle far, far away',\" he said. Mr Khandhar addressed his angry open letter to the Malaysian chess community, but it soon spread across the country and worldwide. Zuraida Kamaruddin, an MP for the National Justice Party, criticised the organisers for not making a proper statement in response, according to Malaysia's the Star newspaper. \"I am very agitated about the issue. I feel for the young girl as if she were my own daughter,\" she said on Monday. Mr Khandhar also posted a picture of the outfit, without showing the face of the girl, who he said was \"extremely disturbed, and embarrassed\". He said she was given the opportunity to buy some trousers to continue competing the next day, but as the shops were closed, she was forced to withdraw from the event. Datuk Heng Seai Kie, an adviser for the government's Department of National Unity and National Integration, told the Star that the organisers should not act as \"moral police\" by telling girls what to wear. \"Playing chess has nothing to do with dressing, as it is a healthy activity, and from the photo, she was decently dressed,\" she said.

{"article": "The firm had axed its iPhone rival in October last year after an earlier botched recall and re-release. The recall is thought to have cost $5.3bn (Â£4.3bn) and was hugely damaging for the South Korean firm's reputation. On Monday, Samsung said that neither software nor hardware were at fault, only the batteries. Internal and independent investigations \"concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents\", the South Korean technology giant said in a statement. The company said that errors both in design and manufacturing affected batteries by two different manufacturers. According to the findings, the problems centred on insufficient insulation material within the batteries and a design that did not give enough room to safely accommodate the batteries' electrodes. Samsung said it was \"taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of the battery design and manufacturing process\". The smartphone giant did not name the battery suppliers during their Monday presentation, though last year had identified them as their affiliate Samsung SDI and Chinese company Amperex Technology. Samsung said it did not plan to take legal action and that it accepted responsibility for asking the suppliers to meet certain specifications. \"Samsung has done what they needed to do for now but the true test will need to happen over time,\" analyst Bryan Ma of IDC told the BBC. \"If successive products can be delivered consistently without incident in the next year or so, then they will be in a better position to regain consumers' trust.\" Launched in August 2016, Samsung's Note 7 device was marketed as a large-screen top-end device and positioned as a rival to Apple's iPhone. But in September, Samsung had to recall about 2.5 million phones after complaints of overheating and exploding batteries. The firm insisted that all replaced devices were safe. However, that was followed by reports that those phones were also overheating. The company said there would be no repeat of the fires in future devices such as the upcoming S8. \"We look forward to moving ahead with a renewed commitment to safety. The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.\" The firm also said it would not unveil its upcoming Galaxy S8 phone at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, as had been expected, suggesting the flagship model's launch may be later in the year.

The temporary order had ordered Depp not to contact Heard, and stay 100 yards away from her, after she accused him of striking her and throwing a mobile phone during a fight earlier this year.

The payments, previously established to be a six-figure sum, were confirmed in the London council's accounts. But Ms Shoesmith told the BBC: \"This is not a figure I recognise.\" She added: \"I have made a confidential agreement with Haringey that prevents me giving the actual figures.\" However, the council's draft accounts for 2013-2014 show Ms Shoesmith was awarded £377,266 for salary, fees and allowance, £217,266 in compensation for loss of office, and £84,819 for employer pension contributions. Peter Connelly had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months.

Last weekend, the Sunday Independent claimed that Mr Norris was about to put himself forward once again, following an \"consistent outpouring\" of public support. The newspaper said the senator would use an appearance on RTE's Late, Late Show this Friday to publicly state his intention to re-start his Aras campaign. If so, Mr Norris has just over two weeks to secure the 20 political nominations he needs to get his name on to the presidential ballot paper. With the 28 September deadline for nominations looming, time is not on his side. Many independent TDs, who had previously backed the senator have now withdrawn their support, leaving Mr Norris with little other option than to turn to Fianna Fail for help. However, party sources have indicated they are unlikely to support the former front-runner. Although they are not running a candidate, many Fianna Fail members believe Mr Norris does not deserve their backing after he turned down their support earlier in the summer. Unless he can change their minds his latest Aras bid could fall at the first hurdle. An alternate route would be to secure the support of four county councils, but time is running out. Despite facing numerous difficulties, Mr Norris does have one ace up his sleeve. Although, the clemency controversy cost Mr Norris a number of political allies, it did not hamper the public's fascination with the openly-gay, Joycean scholar. When the letter to the Isreali authorities was released back in July, Mr Norris admitted he made a \"human error\", but insisted it was borne solely from a sense of love and concern for his former partner. He bowed out of the race, taking with him much of the public's interest in October's election. What followed was weeks of speculation about who could fill his shoes. The electorate's appetite for an equally colourful and charismatic replacement lead to calls for a celebrity to enter the field. Broadcasters, Gay Byrne and Micheal O'Muircheartaigh considered the idea, before they both backed out and once again quelled the fire of interest in the presidential election.

{"article": "His patient sits still but her face contorts with pain in a hospital ward in Namibia's capital, Windhoek. The wards are busy on this Monday morning and scores are waiting to be treated in the emergency department. The 25-year-old is slight but has a quiet confidence about him and people here in Katutura hospital seem to trust him. He was one of 37 in the first class of locally trained doctors to graduate earlier this year. Until 2010, when the country's first medical school opened, would-be doctors had to travel abroad - to South Africa, Russia, Cuba, Algeria and China - to be educated. So Dr Murangi is in the vanguard of something which could see a transformation in the health service here. Namibia is a vast country but has a population of just 2.5 million, which is scattered in mostly rural and arid regions. This means that doctors are concentrated in urban areas and sometimes people have to travel a long way to get treated. This morning some have travelled more than 50km (30 miles) to get to Katutura hospital. They wait quietly, but the doctors are feeling the pressure. \"Sometimes the workload can get quite overwhelming, you find that you have many patients to see and you get fatigued. You don't have time to rest. This can really negatively affect patient care,\" Dr Murangi tells the BBC. But things are improving and many here believe that the country's new medical school presents a lasting solution to the problem of a lack of doctors. Source: WHO Global Health Observatory The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the shortage of medical staff in the public health sector here has hindered Namibia's development. One of the reasons behind the shortage is that it was only since independence from South Africa's apartheid government in 1990 that health services were made available to the majority of people in Namibia, experts say. A high HIV rate, shortage of medication in rural hospitals, limited training facilities, old infrastructure and a lack of equipment to treat patients have compounded the problem. But Deputy Health Minister Juliet Kavetuna, who describes the sector as \"fragile\", says she believes the country is now on the right track. \"We are now training more doctors than ever,\" she says. \"Our research has shown that in our hospitals we need multiple disciplines including pharmacists, physiotherapists and dentists to work alongside doctors. \"We believe we are now taking steps in the right direction.\" For years Namibia's government had to spend a lot of money funding students to train abroad. Some of the graduates then moved into private healthcare, which can pay more and offer better working conditions, but are beyond the reach of most of the population. But with the new graduates this is expected to change. \"These graduates are the pride of Namibia. \"Many of our doctors that we get from abroad want to stay in Windhoek but our home-grown doctors, because they know our healthcare system, want to go and work outside in rural areas - that will be good for our people,\" says the deputy health minister. Dr Murangi, the eldest of four children, graduated with the help of government funding, and said he would not have become a doctor otherwise. For many families, a medical degree is simply unaffordable and Dr Murangi says he was fortunate to receive a full scholarship. \"My family were very proud when I graduated, they've even encouraged me to study further if possible. It means a lot to all of us.\" And what of those following in his footsteps? A short distance from the bustling hospital, Namibia's future doctors are huddled together in a well kitted-out laboratory learning about neurological disorders and how to diagnose them. The University of Namibia's medical sciences centre started with 50 students but now 400, mostly Namibians, are enrolled here, and building work continues alongside the teaching. The school complex is grand with high, sleekly finished red and grey walls. The modern architecture stands out among the somewhat run-down houses in the area. Inside I sit at the cafeteria with some first year students, aged between 18 and 19, who were on a break between between classes. \"It's better to study in a place with which you are familiar. I do want to travel abroad to learn more but this is where my skills are most needed,\" says Nzinga Mwanachilenga. Another, Ndapandula Hamunime, tells me she studied in Hungary for a year and is now back home. \"I think the programme here is more suited to the social setting of Namibia and I think in the end that will help patients. \"From very early in the programme, we work very closely with communities and we build relationships with them,\" she says. But a medical degree does not come cheap.  At Cape Town's prestigious university, where Namibia's government regularly sends its students, tuition is about 64,500 rand ($4,640; Â£3,800). The degree at UNAM's costs about the same. \"I think there are many people that are interested in studying medicine but they couldn't because that course wasn't offered here and they couldn't afford the extra costs of studying overseas, so having our own university helps,\" says Jennifer Muyenga-Muyenga. \"It also means I can be with my family.\" These \"home-grown\" doctors, as they have been nicknamed, hope they can offer more to patients but add they will need the continued support of internationally trained doctors. Namibia's health problems are far from over but many are hopeful that quality health will no longer be seen as a luxury, beyond the reach of many.", "question": "Dr Tjamena Murangi is seeing to a patient with a large infected wound on her arm - it is swollen and has @placeholder colour . \" Sorry Sisi , sorry , \" he says in his soft - spoken voice as he gently cleans her wound .", "option_0": "promised", "option_1": "declared", "option_2": "lost", "option_3": "focused", "option_4": "provoked", "label": 2}

{"article": "\"God covers them when they come out of water,\" said Abu Bakr Al Soussi sombrely. The young Libyan photographer documented this unidentified corpse, and almost 20 others, on the shores at Garabulli, east of the capital, Tripoli, in March. As a volunteer with the Red Crescent, he may have to photograph many more. They are part of a strange and terrible harvest from the seas - the nameless dead of the Mediterranean. So far this year, more than 3,000 migrants and refugees have been claimed by the waves as they tried to reach Europe, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). But Betty, a 29-year-old single mother from Nigeria who did not want her surname to be published, is undaunted at the prospect of crossing the sea in an overcrowded inflatable boat.  Small wonder perhaps. She has already been deceived, trafficked across the Sahara desert, beaten, and brutalised. A smuggler back home had promised her a job in Egypt. But after she paid him 200,000 Nigerian naira ($645; £490), she was loaded onto a truck for a harrowing journey to Tripoli. \"A lot of people die in the desert. When anybody fell down, they were not going to wait. I saw so many dead bodies. I was crying,\" she told the BBC. \"If you shout you would be killed, instantly. Even when we lay down in the desert, we did not know we were sleeping on top of a dead body.  It was when we removed our blankets that we saw - ah this is a skeleton. \" On arrival in Libya, there was \"another pain entirely\", Betty said. She was delivered to a gang which tried to force her into prostitution. She had to buy her freedom by borrowing more money. Now she has paid another trafficker 1,200 Libyan dinars ($860;£655) to take her to Europe. She says she has no choice. \"I need to go because I am a single mother of two boys. I need to go to Germany,\" Betty told the BBC. \"Things are not easy there too I know, but it's much better than Nigeria. My children need to go to school. They need to have a better life.\" Mohammed Garbaj of the Tripoli Coastguard has come across many like Betty, dead and alive. The wiry and weather-beaten skipper has rescued countless numbers, but is haunted by those he could not save. \"One time we went to rescue a boat but unfortunately we found only one person alive,\" he said. \"All the others had drowned - there were 120 of them. The people who send them on these boats are not good Muslims. They are heartless, sending people to die in the sea.\" We joined Mr Garbaj on a search for smugglers and migrants in distress, leaving port in a 12-metre inflatable.  It is the only seaworthy vessel the Tripoli coastguard has - they cannot afford to repair the other three. In pitch darkness Mr Garbaj and his crew switched off their engine and listened out for migrants' vessels. There was little else they could do. They did not have night-vision goggles, and their radar did not detect small boats. They admitted it was the traffickers who ruled the waves. \"The smugglers have more boats and more weapons,\" said Mohammed Boushagour, a young crewmate. \"They have long-range guns. They can escort the migrants to European waters and we can't do anything to stop them. The state doesn't support us. We haven't been paid since March,\" he added. Coastguard officials say there is another problem - Operation Sophia. The European Union mission, which operates just beyond Libya's territorial waters, was supposed to disrupt smuggling. Instead, it is providing \"a taxi service for migrants\", Colonel Ashraf Al Badri, head of the Tripoli Anti-Smuggling Unit, told the BBC. \"From my point of view, it's indirectly encouraging the migrants to go to Europe. Now, they have to travel just 12 miles. Then Operation Sophia rescues them. They are given food and taken to Europe,\" he said. \"Of course, this information spreads. The migrants all know that instead of a dangerous journey lasting more than a day, they will get picked up in four or five hours.\" That view was echoed by a smuggler, now in detention in Tripoli, who the authorities described as a big fish. \"The operation saves life,\" he told the BBC, \"and encourages people to travel more.\" But the IOM argues that with or without Operation Sophia, migrants and refugees will try to reach Europe. \"I can understand what the Libyans are saying about a pull factor, but people will always find ways,\" said its spokesman Itayi Viriri. \"We shudder to imagine what the situation would be like without a concerned rescue effort. The issue of saving lives is paramount.\" Those saved by the Libyan coastguard wind up in detention centres like Abu Salim, on the outskirts of Tripoli. Hundreds are trapped here in what amounts to an airless mini-prison, women and children among them. The youngest detainee we saw was a 21-day-old baby called Mahmud. Many of those we met there were economic migrants, like a 14-year old from The Gambia, in a red and white striped hat. He said he had travelled to Libya alone in the hope of crossing to Europe and finding a job. \"I come from a poor family. I wanted to get to Italy, so I can feed my family. They have not heard from me for two months. They will think I am dead,\" he added. His countryman Abdul Jayie, who is 18, told us the detainees were kept inside for a month at a time. \"Sometimes there are 200-300 people.  We all share two toilets. I feel shame at being a prisoner. I want to go home.\" The authorities say they are doing their best, with scarce resources, at a time when Libya is barely afloat. \"The [food] supplier to our camp gets his money from the state, and he hasn't been paid for a year,\" said Ramadan Rais, the head of Abu Salim. Many of the detainees are visibly desperate to be released. That only happens if they agree to be deported, like the 160 Gambian men who left the centre recently. \"Going back home will be like going to paradise,\" one man said as he queued for a bus. \"I want to see my mother.\" Back on the seashore, Betty is barefoot, with the waves lapping at her feet. \"I am not afraid,\" she said. \"My mind is strong because I believe in God. Every time I look at the sea I say to the water: 'You are not my limit.

A 12,000-strong UN mission in South Sudan was unable to prevent attacks. The announcement was made by the East African regional body, Igad, and confirmed by South Sudan cabinet minister Dr Martin Elia Lomuro. President Salva Kiir had previously dismissed the idea of an additional force. The proposal for a new unit in South Sudan was backed by the African Union and discussed at a meeting in Ethiopia of Igad - the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. But much of the details of the force remain unclear. Igad sources have suggested a new force should have a more far-reaching mandate than the existing peacekeeping mission. But after the meeting, South Sudan's Minister of Cabinet Affairs Martin Elia Lomuro told the BBC further talks were needed to discuss the mandate, size and timeline for any force. Correspondents say the group of soldiers from different African countries is likely to be modelled on a similar unit deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo to combat rebels from the M23 group. Last week, President Kiir removed Riek Machar as first vice-president, two weeks after the rival leaders' forces clashed in the capital. The two had backed a peace deal signed in the wake of violence in recent years. In the wake of the latest fighting, Mr Machar's spokesman told AFP news agency that \"the only hope is a protection force\". The BBC's Emmanuel Igunza, reporting from the region, said it was also agreed at the Igad meeting that the newly appointed vice-president, Taban Deng, would step down from his position if Mr Machar agreed to return to Juba to rejoin the transitional government.

{"article": "The BBC has heard from Britons who have already started taking steps towards obtaining dual nationality in another EU country. Some are hoping it will help them continue to live and work in the 27 other countries that make up the union while others have more ideological reasons. Name: Rachel Pilling From: London Applying for passport in: Germany Rachel has started the process of applying for German citizenship - an option that is open to her because her Jewish grandmother fled Nazi Germany in 1936 and ultimately settled in London. The naturalisation claim under article 116 of the German Basic Law allows anybody who was deprived of their German citizenship between 30 January 1933 and 8 May 1945 on political, racial or religious grounds to reclaim their citizenship.  Importantly, this also applies to any of their direct descendants. \"I previously felt there would be no benefit in having a German passport as well as a British passport but if we leave the EU, then that may well change,\" says Rachel. \"There is a real sense of sadness about this throughout my family. I have spoken to my grandmother and, while she will not be applying, she supports the idea of the rest of us doing so. Despite everything that happened in the past, she is really in favour of Europe and feels a lot of love for Europe. \"At the moment I am free to study or work anywhere in the EU. I can't be certain that it will stay that way. If there were no physical advantages with regards to studying and working abroad then I probably wouldn't apply for a German passport but this could have a big influence on my life,\" she adds. Name: Joanne Munro From: Brighton Applying for passport in: Italy or Croatia Joanne doesn't actually think having an EU passport will make much practical difference, \"except for shorter queues in the airport\", and her reasons for applying are \"symbolic\". \"I am an EU citizen and I'm not prepared to have anybody take that away from me,\" she says. \"I feel European and looking at the bigger picture in the long term, we need to be able to act as one people, on one planet. There needs to be more unity, not more division so holding onto my European citizenship and passport is a way to stay loyal to that idea.\" The 44-year-old hopes her grandmother, born in a village near Trieste in modern-day Italy, may provide her route to obtaining a European passport. Initially confident that she would be eligible for an Italian passport under the legal principle of Jure Sanguinis (right of blood), a territorial dispute over which country Trieste belonged to back in 1922 has made her quest more challenging. She may have to apply for Croation citizenship instead. \"It's an omni-shambles really but I have all of the paperwork and one way or another I am going to get a European passport,\" she says. Name: Oliver Baroni From: London Applying for passport in: Italy Oliver lives in Zurich and has both British and Swiss passports. As Switzerland is outside the European Union, the 44-year-old now faces the prospect of holding two non-EU passports. Since the result of the EU referendum, he has begun researching his Italian roots and says he is doing so for the benefit of his sons, aged eight and 18. \"It just makes me mad that my kids won't be able to travel freely in Europe to study or work,\" he says. The musician also hopes that having another passport might help make it easier for his band, The HillBilly Moon Explosion, when they tour in Europe. \"The first thing I did when it became clear that there had been a vote to leave the EU was to Google 'apply for Italian citizenship' and apparently it is not too difficult. The paperwork is likely to be a pain in the neck but it should be possible.\" Any claim made will be based on the fact Oliver's mother was born in Italy before moving to Switzerland and then the UK. Name: Damian Allinson From: Bristol Applying for passport in: Ireland Damian, who works in finance in London, is determined not to let Brexit undermine his links to Europe. The 25-year-old campaigned to remain in the EU and is chair of the London branch of the Young European Movement a group encouraging, dialogue, debate and involvement in European relations for young people. \"Like most 'Remainers', I have not only the disappointment of losing the vote but also the knowledge that I've had a lot of my hopes and career ambitions scuppered by Brexit unless I can get EU citizenship,\" he says. Damian is entitled to an Irish passport as his maternal grandfather was from County Mayo. He began work on his application before the referendum was announced because he thought it would help his plans to work in the US. \"I would have liked to have had the passport anyway but now I need it to retain my ties to the continent in terms of travel, work and culture.\" Name: Hannah Neira From: Horsham Applying for passport in: Spain Hannah's father's side of the family is Spanish and she is very close to her paternal grandparents. The 28-year-old plans to move to Spain in a few years, once her career has settled down. \"Because Brexit looks like it will put a damper on my plans to nurture my Spanish side, I contacted the Spanish embassy on 24 June to start the process of obtaining a Spanish passport,\" she says. \"I think I qualify automatically because my father has Spanish nationality, though I'm not 100% sure.\" She's keen not to lose her Anglo-Spanish identity and wants to retain freedom of movement as an EU citizen. \"Though my Spanish is quite poor, I feel connected to Spanish culture through my grandparents.

{"article": "In a statement, it said Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay would raise the issue at a major two-day Asia-Europe summit starting on Friday, attended by China's Premier Li Keqiang. A UN-backed tribunal ruled on Tuesday that there was no legal basis to China's claims in the South China Sea. China has vowed to ignore the ruling. It says the panel has no jurisdiction and its activities in the region will not be affected. The Asia-Europe Meeting Summit (Asem) in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia on Friday and Saturday will be the first major multilateral diplomatic gathering since the 12 July ruling over the South China Sea. The summit will see 53 leaders from Asia and Europe attending, including from countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia which also claim territory in the region. It will also be the first meeting in which the new Philippine government of President Rodrigo Duterte will be represented on the world stage. The Department of Foreign Affairs said Mr Yasay, representing Mr Duterte, would \"discuss within the context of Asem's agenda the Philippines' peaceful and rules-based approach on the South China Sea and the need for parties to respect the recent decision\". It is the strongest statement yet from the Philippines on the ruling. Mr Duterte has adopted a more conciliatory approach than his predecessor Benigno Aquino, saying the Philippines would be willing to share natural resources with China in contested areas if the tribunal ruled in its favour. It initially welcomed the ruling as a \"milestone decision\", but without outright celebration. China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, has said the summit is \"not a suitable place to discuss\" the issue. \"It should not be put on the agenda,\" Assistant Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told Reuters. Tuesday's ruling came from an arbitration tribunal brought by the Philippines under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both countries have signed. It said China had violated the Philippines' sovereign rights and caused \"severe harm to the coral reef environment\" by building artificial islands.

The figure is more than five times higher than the number of people that were feared to have been affected. The data breach, which came to light in April, was widely blamed on China. Authorities in Beijing have publicly denied any involvement. The breach prompted a series of hearings in Congress and widespread criticism of the state of US cyber defences. Politicians from both parties demanded OPM boss Katherine Archuleta be fired. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, said President Barack Obama \"must take a strong stand against incompetence in his administration and instill new leadership at OPM\". Last month, officials said personnel records of 4.2 million current and former federal government employees had been stolen in an incident. On Thursday, OPM said that while investigating that breach they discovered additional information had also been compromised, including the social security numbers of 21.5 million individuals. The stolen data also includes health and financial information, criminal records, and the names and addresses of government employees and their relatives. Those affected include 19.7 million people who underwent background checks and 1.8 million others, mostly the partners of job applicants. OPM serves as the human resource department for the US government. The agency issues security clearances and compiles records of all federal government employees. The agency said that it had \"no information at this time to suggest any misuse or further dissemination of the information that was stolen from OPM's systems.\" But it said that for anyone who underwent a background investigation in 2000 or afterwards \"it is highly likely that the individual is impacted by this cyber breach.\" Last month, US intelligence chief James Clapper said China was the \"leading suspect\" in the massive data breaches. His comments came after three days of high-level talks in which China and the US agreed to a \"code of conduct\" on cyber security issues.

{"article": "\"We are abandoning the constraints of geography and national boundaries,\" said Jonathan Taylor, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation. At present, the £50,000 ($79,850) prize only considers works by writers from the Commonwealth, Ireland or Zimbabwe. Rumours the Booker panel would expand their criteria began over the weekend. A report in the Sunday Times claimed authors from the US would be allowed to compete for the first time - but organisers said the information was \"incomplete\". Announcing the changes in London on Wednesday, the Booker Foundation said: \"The expanded prize will recognise, celebrate and embrace authors writing in English, whether from Chicago, Sheffield or Shanghai.\" \"The Trustees have not made this decision quickly or lightly,\" it added, saying consultation with authors, publishers and booksellers began in 2011. They had initially investigated setting up a new prize specifically for US writers, but decided such a move could \"jeopardise or dilute\" the main event. Reaction to the announcement has been mixed. \"I think it's an excellent idea,\" former winner John Banville told the BBC, discussing the move to permit American novelists in particular. \"It is silly that it is not open to everyone - but God help the rest of us, because American fiction is very strong indeed.\" Banville, who took the prize in 2005 for The Sea, added the expanded field would make life \"very difficult for the judges\". \"They will have to limit how many books can enter, somehow.\" Author AS Byatt said she was \"very strongly against\" opening up the prize \"because it will make judging impossible\". \"At the moment the Booker is the best literary prize because all of the judges read all of the books,\" she said. Byatt was herself a judge in 1974, and later won in 1990 for Possession: A Romance. The Booker committee have made a \"commercial decision,\" according to Dr David Brauner, an expert in contemporary American fiction at the University of Reading. \"I think what has forced their hand is the announcement of the Folio Prize - because they've made a big thing of that prize being eligible to any Anglophone novel, no matter what the nationality of its author\". \"The Man Booker felt they didn't want to be outflanked. They want to retain their place as the most prestigious prize for fiction in this country and they felt this would steal the thunder of the Folio - the distinctiveness of that prize was that it was going to be more international, but now that's been blurred somewhat.\" Some feel American novelists like Jonathan Franzen and Toni Morrison will come to dominate the prize, robbing British authors of the sales and publicity that come with the honour. Even established writers can benefit. Last year's winner, Hilary Mantel, sold 10,605 copies of her novel, Bring Up The Bodies, in the UK in the week after the prize was announced. The previous week, she had sold 1,846. The Folio Prize will hand out its first accolade next March. The £40,000 prize will be awarded to a work of fiction written in the English language published in the UK - including American authors. The prize was first announced in 2011 amidst a row in literary circles about the decision by Booker judges that year to focus on \"readability\", but organisers have denied it is a rival to the Booker. It is backed by a 100-strong academy of authors and critics which includes Margaret Atwood and Philip Pullman. The new eligibility criteria for the Booker Prize will necessitate some changes to the way books are submitted for consideration. Currently, publishers can each submit two books. From next year, that will be reduced to one. However, a publisher who has had one or two longlisted books in the last five years will be allowed two submissions; a publisher with three or four positions on the longlist will get three; and a publisher with five or more will get four submissions. \"The number of books publishers are allowed to submit has also long been a concern,\" said Taylor. \"Our new model, in recognising literary achievement, should encourage the traditional literary publishing  houses while ensuring novels from new green-shoot publishers continue to be included.\" It is thought the new submission guidelines could reduce the number of books under consideration from 151 this year to as little as 130. Established 45 years ago, the Booker Prize for Fiction made its first award in 1969, to PH Newby's Something To Answer For. The winner of the 2013 award will be announced on 15 October at an awards ceremony at London's Guildhall.", "question": "Authors writing in English from all corners of the globe will be eligible for the Man Booker Prize from 2014 , organisers have @placeholder .", "option_0": "concluded", "option_1": "agreed", "option_2": "lost", "option_3": "emerged", "option_4": "confirmed", "label": 4}

The Scottish government said the \"named person' would act as a central point to help families if they needed it. But objectors said it would undermine parents. The measures, in the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act, are due to come into force from August 2016. Ministers said the \"named person\" would act as a liaison between the child, their family and access to any services they may need. Those in favour said it would make help easier to find and co-ordinate action if children needed it and could act as an early warning system. But objectors argued that the definition of \"well-being\" was so broad it had the potential to lead to disputes between the state and families. The No To Named Persons (NO2NP) campaign group said the measures breached data protection laws and the human rights of parents. A legal challenge against the legislation failed at the Court of Session last month but NO2NP is considering an appeal. The policy is already being rolled out in parts of Scotland including the Highlands, Edinburgh, Fife, Angus and South Ayrshire.

His report also says that complaints about school transport are more likely to be upheld than other complaints - 57% in the six months to last September, compared with 53% overall. \"When it comes to school transport... councils must ensure decisions are made fairly, legally and transparently,\" said Mr King. \"Failing to do this can cause confusion, financial hardship and have a significant impact on some of the most vulnerable families, particularly those who have children with special educational needs.\" By law, councils in England must provide free transport for pupils under the age of 16 who cannot walk to school because they: To qualify for free transport, children must attend their nearest state-funded school, but there is flexibility for children with special needs or disabilities.

It follows an order last month by the local authorities to cut the number of Larung Gar residents by half to 5,000. Chinese officials are reported to have cited overcrowding concerns. Larung Gar is said to be the biggest Tibetan Buddhist institute in the world. The academy and monastery, founded in 1980, sprawls over a mountainside in Sertar county in eastern Tibet, and attracts thousands of Buddhist monks and nuns who wish to study there. The students commonly stay in log cabins and correspondents say the site has grown considerably in recent years. Free Tibet published several pictures on Twitter and video footage on YouTube that appeared to show wooden buildings razed to the ground. Heavy equipment that could have been used for demolition was seen in some of the images. The campaign group said the work team had been accompanied by Chinese police and members of the armed forces dressed in plain clothes. There has been no formal comment by Chinese authorities. A Sertar county government official contacted by Associated Press said the purpose of the work was to renovate rather than remove the buildings. One student at Larung Gar was quoted by Free Tibet as saying: \"If the only way to solve the overpopulation is destroying the houses, then why is the same policy not implemented in the Chinese cities and towns where the population is overcrowded? \"Where is the equality, rule by law, public welfare, religious freedom and equal rights of all nationalities (as they say) if you crush down the houses of innocent religious practitioners who are living simple lives?\" Chinese authorities have said Larung Gar's population must be reduced from 10,000 to no more than 3,500 nuns and 1,500 monks by October. Free Tibet director Eleanor Byrne-Rosengren said: \"The demolition at Larung Gar is clearly nothing to do with overcrowding - it is just another tactic in China's attempt to subvert the influence of Buddhism in Tibet.\" Beijing claims a centuries-old sovereignty over the Himalayan region. Tibet has spent some of its history functioning as an independent entity and other periods ruled by Chinese and Mongolian dynasties. China sent in thousands of troops to enforce its claim on the region in 1950. Some areas became the Tibetan Autonomous Region and others were incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces.

The call has been welcomed by industry bodies. The LGA represents 370 councils in England and Wales with responsibility for public health. The cost to the NHS of dealing with excessive alcohol consumption is estimated to be Â£3.5bn a year, according to the LGA. Tony Page, the licensing spokesman for the LGA, said: \"Increasing the availability of zero alcohol and weaker strength drinks will help people live healthier lives by helping to control drinking levels and tackle the harm caused by excessive drinking. \"With a new generation of non-drinkers on the rise, there is a growing demand for greater choice in alcohol-free and weaker drinks, with several 'dry bars' opening up across the country. \"Tax breaks for beer have helped fuel a rise in low-strength products. This should now be extended to cider, wine and spirits.\" He also said that drinking habits were changing and \"brewers needed to capitalise on this by producing a range of different options\" for people. Figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that excessive consumption of alcohol is also associated with violent crime. In just over a half of all instances of violent crime in England and Wales in 2013-14, the victim believed that the perpetrator was drunk. The LGA says widening the availability of low-strength and alcohol-free drinks would \"revitalise pubs, which are closing at a rate of nearly 30 a week, and re-establish them as vibrant centres of communities\". There is also a growing number of non-drinkers, with one in five adults (21%) saying they do not drink alcohol at all - up from 19% in 2005. A spokesman for the Portman Group - which campaigns for the drinks industry on social responsibility - said: \"We welcome this support for lower strength drinks. \"Official statistics show a decade-long decline in harmful drinking in the UK, and alcohol companies are committed to continuing this positive trend.\" A spokesman for the British Beer and Pub Association said: \"Lower taxes for lower strength drinks is a great idea, and we would support this principle for other drinks categories.\" Earlier this year, tough new guidelines were issued on alcohol consumption, which said there was no such thing as a safe level of drinking. The UK's chief medical officers said new research showed any amount of alcohol could increase the risk of cancer. Their new advice says men and women who drink regularly should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine.

Last year, vets had to put down a calf called Kitto after he was rejected by his mother and developed breathing problems. In 2006, a fire killed a mother and her week-old calf.

In an unrelated case, the FBI wants Apple to unlock the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California in December. But Apple has resisted, calling that demand \"dangerous\" and \"unprecedented\". The ruling in Brooklyn on Monday centres on the same point as the San Bernardino case. The two court cases are not linked - the magistrate in San Bernardino doesn't have to pay any attention to the ruling and remarks from the New York judge. But Apple feels the decision in New York gives added strength to its position. A senior Apple spokesman told reporters in a conference call that he was confident the San Bernardino judge would carefully analyse the New York ruling. Most promising for Apple is the reason for which Judge Orenstein threw out the New York case. He said he was not at all convinced the All Writs Act, a law more than two centuries old, could be used to force Apple to comply. The same law is being used in San Bernardino. The All Writs Act is designed to give law enforcement powers not specifically addressed in other laws - but using it requires meeting certain strict criteria, too burdensome to detail here. No legal precedent has been set here - but as the magistrate in San Bernardino considers her ruling, momentum certainly appears to be with the computing giant. Apple v the FBI - a plain English guide Apple's boss hits back at FBI conduct Bill Gates calls for terror data debate Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in the Californian city in December. A court order in California demanded Apple help circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contains crucial information. Apple's CEO Tim Cook said the request was \"an overreach by the US government\" and risked giving authorities \"the power to reach into anyone's device to capture their data\". Last week, the company asked a court to overturn the ruling. The same Act from 1789 that was used by the FBI in the San Bernardino request was applied in the Brooklyn case. But Judge James Orenstein said the Act was not applicable in this case, adding that it was not right to impose \"on Apple the obligation to assist the government's investigation against its will\".

He armed himself with a hammer to stage the raid on the Gala Park post office on Balmoral Place. During the robbery he repeatedly punched manager Farrukh Sair, who was also struck on the head with an object. Renwick, who lived directly opposite the premises, also robbed another man, John Hardie, who had come into the store. A judge told Renwick at the High Court in Edinburgh: \"You have 31 convictions encompassing some 53 offences. \"For a young man that is a formidable record and you are placed at high risk of future offending.\" Lord Burns ordered that Renwick serve 220 days of an unexpired part of a previous prison sentence, from which he had been freed early, before he starts the four-year term. Renwick will be monitored for a further three years following his release from prison. During the raid he stole between Â£2,000 and Â£2,500 in cash, along with stamps, cigarettes and mobile phones. He also robbed Mr Hardie of a phone and a wallet containing Â£40. Renwick had jumped over a counter armed with the hammer and told Mr Sair to get to the floor before taking cash.

{"article": "The annual Barclays prosperity map found 43,000 Scottish adults were worth seven figures in the year to April. That was more than 10% fewer than last year's study. Barclays attributed the fall to a decline in some economic measures used to calculate the numbers, including corporate profits. Scotland now commands a 6.2% share of the UK's millionaires, down from 6.7% in 2015. However, the prosperity index also suggested Scotland saw the biggest increase to household wealth of any area of the UK in the year. It rose by 13% north of the border, ahead of both London (up 12%) and the South East (up 11%). Barclays said the rise could be linked to Scotland's median private pensions wealth. It jumped 60%, compared with 19% in England and 24% in Wales. Activity by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) was also on the up, which Barclays said was a strong indicator of rising prosperity. Scotland recorded the biggest growth in SME turnover at 8%, ahead of London in second place at 7%. Overall, Scotland was the seventh most prosperous area on the index, behind the East Midlands, Northern Ireland, South West and Eastern England, South East and London. The report said every area in the UK was more prosperous than last year. Wealth, spending or earnings rose across the country, while jobless rates dropped. The research uses factors such as average annual pay, the percentage of households giving to charity, business growth rates and exam scores to generate a \"prosperity index\" score for each area of the UK.

{"article": "Kaori Okuni, one of the women campaigning for change, said the ruling would lead to \"suffering for those who plan to marry and those who are set to be born\". Most women in Japan end up taking their husband's surname, a practice set to continue after Wednesday's ruling. But what do other countries do? In most well-populated countries, women are free to change their surname on marrying, if they wish. Many go further than that, putting in place laws stating that women do not have to change their names. France's law has been in place since the 18th century but, much like in Italy, there is some flexibility allowing wives to use their husband's surnames in an informal way. On all official paperwork, however, the maiden name must remain. The laws are much tougher in Greece and Quebec. In Greece, you must petition a court for a name change, and in Quebec, even if they wanted to, a wife cannot take her husband's surname at any point. In Iceland, women keep their maiden names after marriage. A surname is derived from a father's first name - so Bjork, Gudmund's daughter, becomes Bjork Gudmundsdottir - or, in certain circumstances, the mother's. A similar pattern is also followed in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where there is no concept of surnames as known in many Western countries. At birth, people are given one name, that is then followed by the father's name then the grandfather's name. Even after marrying, women retain their original three names. Could the Avatar actress Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego - now Marco Saldana - be trend setters? The couple announced the move earlier this year, with Mrs Saldana calling her husband \"a man who stood by change\". In one case from 2012, however, a Mississippi man needed the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to take his wife's surname, having initially been prevented from changing the name on his driving licence. And in France, a change in the law now allows men to take their wife's surname - the first case was registered in Lyon in 2012, but only after seven attempts to do so were denied, despite the amendment.", "question": "Japan 's Supreme Court has ruled that all married couples must have the same surname , despite @placeholder that the practice is discriminatory and archaic .", "option_0": "declaring", "option_1": "confirmed", "option_2": "speculation", "option_3": "accusations", "option_4": "concerns", "label": 4}

After midnight they'd be subject to arrest. States of emergency were called throughout coastal New England. Amtrak north of New York gave up the fight early in the evening and stopped its train service. Has Winter Storm Juno been big and bad enough to justify that build-up? In New York City, definitely not.  Out here in south-eastern New England ... well, you decide. By 9:30pm, we had snow big-time. By 11pm, blasts of white fury hammered at my windows. Outside the winds whipped the rapidly accumulating inches into tall drifts forcing the few walkers - people with dogs - to negotiate a scape of peaks and valleys.  Vehicular traffic had vanished. In central Providence the electricity held - hence we had cable TV to keep us somewhat distracted. Through the night, however, winds would periodically bang at the windows to remind those snuggling indoors that Juno was still on a rampage. By 7am on Tuesday, there was daylight of sorts. Thousands of Rhode Islanders were without electricity, as was the entire island of Nantucket And the snow kept coming - sideways.

Meanwhile, the coastal communities are getting nervous about the afternoon high tide, expected around 1pm. Some low-lying areas have already seen storm surges. It's approaching noon, and still nobody's out. Nobody. My aunt in Florida just called to remind me that I haven't visited for a while. That kind of thing is going on a lot.

Wilkin has challenged the game's leading players to make a difference as to how rugby league is run. \"You've got to help yourself,\" he told the 5 Live Rugby League podcast. \"One thing I've found is that players will often have an opinion, criticise and comment about things. But there are very few who'll actually give their time to change things.\" Wilkin spent six years attempting to set up a players' union, League 13, which ultimately failed because of a lack of support. He suggested that a union is still badly needed in the face of such a congested fixture list, and at a time when the future structure of the game is under scrutiny from the clubs and the RFL. There have been renewed calls within the game for the players to be given a bigger say, with several senior figures from within their ranks criticising the scheduling of matches. \"The reason League 13 doesn't exist anymore is because ultimately it was a labour of love from me, but there no was investment in time or effort from the players,\" said Wilkin. \"This was an issue going way back. The only way for clubs to make revenue is to run more games and for me that was worrying for two reasons. \"Firstly, I thought it was a false economy. More games diluted the quality. And secondly, if your playing 32 games a year, that's 32 weeks when you're playing a contact sport and that's incredible.

But he thinks representation should go further than that. \"There's nobody actively sitting in meetings with the chief execs, with the clubs, with the chairmen, with the other key stakeholders in the game - there is nobody representing the players at that level.\" he said. \"We need more of those senior players in the game to stand up and have an opinion.

One person injured in the 1996 blast, has called on the UK government to \"support its victims\". The British government said it would \"consider the position in relation to victims elsewhere in the UK\". There were no deaths, but about 200 people were injured when a 3,300lb device exploded near the Arndale Centre on 15 June 1996, devastating the busy shopping area. Greater Manchester Police have launched a fresh review of the evidence in the hope of finally finding those responsible. The Manchester survivors have had their views echoed by the group representing victims of the London Docklands bombing in the same year, who said the government's conduct was \"appalling\". Plans for a special pension for severely injured victims in Northern Ireland were included in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement. However talks on the payment, which would be funded by money devolved to Stormont, have stalled at the Northern Ireland Assembly. Sinn FÃ©in insists injured IRA bombers should also be entitled to the pension but unionist politicians strongly object. A spokesman for the British government's Northern Ireland Office said: \"Victims' issues in Northern Ireland are the responsibility of the devolved administration. \"We can see a case for awarding a pension to victims who were severely physically injured as a result of the Troubles and would like to see this happen.\" He added that victims of violent crime, including terrorism, in England, Scotland and Wales could be eligible for compensation through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.

When it comes to being named captain of his country for the Six Nations tournament, however, he believes it should be straightforward. \"I'm going to sound like a broken record but if I'm playing well then hopefully it's easy to captain a side,\" said Jones, who succeeds Sam Warburton as skipper. \"With the strong leadership group we have, it is a pretty easy job. \"The only comparison I have to [captaining] over a period of time is with the Ospreys. \"In times of transition it can be difficult when you lose senior players - but I'm fortunate to have a strong senior player base here.\" Interim head coach Rob Howley has named a starting XV to face Italy averaging more than 45 caps a man, and including Jones' predecessor Warburton on the blind-side flank. With Wales attempting to adopt a more open, attacking style and seven uncapped players named in the squad for the tournament, many had expected a younger-looking team. Jones defended the decision to opt for experience over youth against the weakest team - statistically - in the tournament. \"I vowed not to talk too much about selection, but we did say we've been respectful to Italy but also put the pressure on the players who have been selected,\" said Jones. \"There's been cries for more changes and blooding of youngsters, which will happen in time, I'm sure of it. \"But do we want to expose them to a potential banana skin? \"And then it's a vicious circle and selection becomes more of a talking point than the team.

Having told Wales they had time for the line-out, referee Chris White then ruled time was up and Italy celebrated their second win over Wales. In the same situation today, and with a revised point system for this year's championship, Jones would take the draw. \"These are the decisions that potentially arise for a team and you'd potentially take the two points rather than a loss and get nothing,\" he said. \"Hopefully we don't get to those circumstances but we've got to be aware of the points system that's in place and the implications it could have later in the tournament.\" With bonus points being introduced to the Six Nations this year, what would Jones do if Wales were leading by a few points having already scored three tries and had a penalty that could potentially make the game safe? \"With this I can wholeheartedly say I'd have to feel it in the game - if I feel we're in the ascendancy, and depending how many players they've got on the park,\" he said. \"I know what I'd lean to because I know what the fallout would be and you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.\" Would he lean towards being conservative? \"Potentially, because you look how wide open the tournament is. But it's definitely a feel thing. You have to justify the decisions when you make them and hopefully we won't have to make them.\" Italy captain Sergio Parisse was man of the match in their controversial win against Wales in 2007 and is still their key player a decade later. Jones is full of admiration for the back-row legend, but says Wales cannot concentrate on him alone. \"If you focus on one person or any player too much you can potentially open holes for other members of the opposition,\" he said. \"We have a defensive system in place that will defend the ball not the player. \"I think the thing now is they've got [coaching team] Mike Catt, Conor O'Shea and Brendan Venter who will potentially make them more dangerous. \"And you throw in the fact they had a good win over South Africa in the autumn, so it's a tricky one to call.\" Jones has been there with Ospreys, Wales and Lions and has all the T-shirts.

{"article": "Jordan's significance results partly from its strategic location at the crossroads of what Christians, Jews and Muslims call the Holy Land. It is a key ally of the US and, together with Egypt, one of only two Arab nations to have made peace with Israel. The desert kingdom emerged out of the post-World War I division of the Middle East by Britain and France. The population at that time was largely made up of tribes which had taken part in the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Today, those original inhabitants - known as East Bank Jordanians - are outnumbered by the descendants of Palestinian refugees from Israel and the West Bank. Country profiles by BBC Monitoring The first ruler of Jordan, the Hashemite Abdullah I, was born in Mecca and played a leading role in the Great Arab Revolt. The death in February 1999 of King Hussein, who ruled for 46 years, left Jordan still struggling for economic and social survival, as well as regional peace. His son, Abdullah II faces the task of maintaining stability while accommodating calls for reform. A blueprint for long-term political, economic and social change - known as the National Agenda - has yet to be implemented, and the Arab Spring popular revolts across the region found some resonance in street protests. Jordan's reputation as one of the region's safest countries was dealt a blow in late 2005 when dozens of people were killed in suicide bomb attacks on hotels in the capital. Iraq-based Islamic militants claimed responsibility. The king said Jordan had been targeted because of its location and its stances. The civil war in neighbouring Syria has seen Jordan play host to some 600,000 Syrian refugees, while the resurgence of Islamic militancy in Iraq also presents security challenges for Amman. Unlike Arab states to the south and east, Jordan has no oil of its own. Its resources are limited to phosphates and agricultural produce. The economy depends largely on services, tourism and foreign aid, of which the US is the main provider. Jordan prides itself on its health service, one of the best in the region. Jordan engaged in two conflicts abroad in 2014 and 2015, taking part in air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Houthi rebels in Yemen.", "question": "The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a small country with few natural resources , but it has played a @placeholder role in the struggle for power in the Middle East .", "option_0": "powerful", "option_1": "major", "option_2": "rare", "option_3": "slight", "option_4": "pivotal", "label": 4}

Saudi Basic Industries, the biggest petrochemical producer, tumbled 8.3% while Saudi Kayan lost 4.8%. Saudi Arabia's budget deficit soared to $98bn (Â£65.7bn) this year on the back of falling crude prices. In the first budget under King Salman, the kingdom said revenues reached 608bn riyals (Â£108.7bn; $162bn), down 15% on official expectations. Spending for the year hit 975bn riyals, some 13% more than forecast. To help make up the shortfall, the country's finance ministry said it would cut subsidies for fuel. Petrol prices could in some cases increase by as much as 50%, authorities said, although they will remain low by international standards. Diesel, electricity and water prices will also increase. King Salman said the budget came \"in light of the decrease in oil prices, the economic and regional and international financial challenges - where global economic growth has declined from its previous level - and the lack of stability in some of the neighbouring states.\" Oil prices have plunged from a five-year high of $125 a barrel in March 2012 to just $37.18 now.

It is the largest member of the Opec oil-producing cartel and has refused to cut output in order to raise prices in an attempt to put other producers - mainly US shale oil companies - out of business. Saudi thinks it can withstand low oil prices for longer than US producers, many of which are small, heavily-indebted firms.

Amedeo Mancini, 35, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of racially aggravated manslaughter. His lawyer said he \"did not mean to kill\" and that he had punched the Nigerian in self defence. Emmanuel Chidi fled Nigeria with his partner Chinyery, 24, after their families came under attack from jihadist group Boko Haram.

The Friends of Colonsay Facebook page has carried a series of photographs of the remains, which look like they are covered in dirty white fur. The group speculated on the possibility of the remains being those of bears, but has since acknowledged the scientists' explanation. Inverness-based SMAS carries out examinations of whales, dolphins and other large marine animals found washed up on Scottish beaches. On the Colonsay discoveries, it said: \"We have had a number of these sort of cases over the years, and are confident that these are highly autolysed cetacean carcases. \"The 'fur' referred to is decomposing blubber, which becomes stringy in appearance as the lipids from the blubber are drained into the sand. \"Once the bones are exposed we may be able to identify these animals to a species level with help from the experts at the National Museum of Scotland.\" The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which has three polar bears at its Highland Wildlife Park, has also said it did not believe the remains to be those of bears.

And, for Democrats, there's a lot of hard work to be done. With Mr Obama's departure, the party is only just beginning its long journey in the political wilderness. Democrats have lost Congress. They've been decimated in state legislatures. Their hoped-for liberal majority on the Supreme Court was blocked by intransigent Senate Republicans. And now the presidency is gone, as well. In the days ahead, the party that thought it had time and demographics on its side, that saw Mr Obama's coalition of young, ethnic and educated voters as a durable governing majority, will try to figure out what, exactly, went wrong. Ironically enough, some liberals are looking at the Tea Party grass-roots conservative movement that emerged in the months after Mr Obama became president in 2009 as a model for their path back to power. At the time, many on the left mocked the impromptu outbursts of conservative protest - which bedevilled Democratic politicians at constituent meetings - as ill-conceived, uninformed or ineffective. Now, they point to recent efforts to confront Republican legislators over attempts to repeal Mr Obama's healthcare reform as signs of life in a dispirited party. Democrats face a tough challenge in the days ahead. They have to settle on a leader for their national committee - resolving an ideological battle between left-wing populists and those who preach continued Obama-style moderation and incrementalism.

{"article": "But according to a report published today, we urgently need to do God - or rather, as a nation, we need to understand religion and belief much better as a driving force within societies across the world, in order to deal with its impact at home. Here, the decrease in mainstream Christianity and the growth of minority religions are raising questions about national identity (what does it mean to be British today?) and how we can live together and accommodate difference peacefully and cohesively, balancing each other's freedoms and rights. It is a timely report, as Europe grapples with a migration crisis caused at least in part by wars involving religion in the Middle East, and the UK begins to bomb targets in Syria connected with the Islamic State group, highlighting national and international anxieties about the rise of militant Islamism and the growth of minority religions in western European societies. It also comes as the UK deals with the impact of partial devolution, the fallout from the Scottish referendum, and the run-up to a referendum that could see the UK leave the European Union, creating a sense that society is atomising, while identity politics are on the rise. Entitled \"Living with Difference\", the report has been released by the Commission on Religion and Belief in Public Life, set up by the Woolf Institute, an academic institute in Cambridge that specialises in interfaith relations. It calls for politicians to overhaul UK public policy on religion and belief, to take account of the increasing impact of religion around the world and the more diverse nature of society in Britain, which is also less religious in many ways. Its aim is to suggest practical ways for government and citizens to respond to social change in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to ensure a shared understanding of the fundamental values underlying public life that guarantee religious freedom while protecting the liberties and values of non-believers. Its recommendations include: The commission was chaired by the cross-bencher Baroness Butler-Sloss, and has taken two years to prepare its report. Twenty religious and academic thinkers from every major religious tradition, as well as the British Humanist Association, received more than 200 submissions of evidence. Baroness Butler-Sloss says that the recommendations amount to a \"new settlement for religion and belief in the UK\" and are aimed at providing space and a role in society for all citizens, \"regardless of their beliefs or absence of them\". She is keen that the UK's civic institutions, from the House of Lords to the coronation and Remembrance Sunday, reflect the growing diversity of today's society. \"From recent events in France, to schools… and even the adverts screened in cinemas, for good or ill, religion and belief impacts directly on all our daily lives,\" says the former Lord Justice of Appeal. The report suggests that the government should repeal the need for schools to hold acts of collective worship or religious observance, and hold \"inclusive assemblies and times for reflection that draw upon a range of sources… and that will contribute to their spiritual, moral, social and cultural development\". It notes that almost half the population now describes itself as non-religious. In 1983, two-thirds of those in the UK would have identified as Christian, whereas today it is down to two-fifths. Half a century ago, Judaism was the second-largest faith tradition, while it is now fourth behind Islam, Hinduism and Sikhism. The recommendations of the 144-page report are a plea for greater understanding, tolerance and knowledge of each other in a society in which religion is no longer a glue that binds, but all too often a source of division, mistrust and sometimes hatred. In particular, the Commission hopes to suggest ways for government policy to enable Britons to avoid \"stereotyping, misunderstanding and oversimplification based on ignorance\". The report itself makes clear that the religious landscape in the UK has been transformed by the growth of non-Christian religions, and a shift away from mainstream Christian denominations and a rise in Evangelical and Pentecostal churches. Twenty-six Church of England bishops sit in the House of Lords, even though Anglicans no longer make up a majority of Christians in the UK. The Commission says that the picture is made more complicated by the growth of fanaticism and a suspicion among many \"that religion is a primary source of all the world's ills\". It acknowledges that while religion can be a \"public good\", it can also be a \"public bad\", which is why its members believe that the government has a legitimate interest in shaping policy to deal with the challenges that have emerged. They argue that the UK government must take a more considered and less piecemeal approach to legislation surrounding issues of religion and belief, and note that \"what it means to be British is not fixed or final\" and has continued to morph and change from the days of the certainties of the British Empire through to the pluralistic society of today. It is a report that accurately reflects the anxiety and uncertainty about national identity that many now feel over how rapidly the UK has changed over the past 30 years, although it may well perhaps irritate both secularists and Christians who feel their voice has been marginalised. What is indisputable is that we are now part of a globalised, interconnected and increasingly unsettled world in which the disputes within and between religions in other nations - from the Middle East to Africa and Asia - are reflected back into the UK, sometimes creating or exacerbating tensions between different communities here. The commission's conclusion is that how the UK responds to those changes will have a profound impact on public life, with education at all levels and dialogue between faiths and those of no faith both crucial components of that response. Because now, it seems, we live at a time where the 50% of the UK's population who say they don't do God need to better understand those who do - while those who identify themselves as spiritual or religious need to accommodate those who don't.", "question": "\" We do n't do God , \" as Tony Blair 's spin doctor Alastair Campbell famously told an interviewer @placeholder to inquire further about the then prime minister 's Christian faith .", "option_0": "attempt", "option_1": "dared", "option_2": "wishing", "option_3": "continues", "option_4": "effort", "label": 2}

China's economy, the world's second-largest, expanded at an annual rate of 7.6% in the second quarter, the slowest pace of growth in three years. Some analysts said the data indicated that recent measures implemented by the government to boost growth, including lowering interest rates, had started to take effect and that the economy was likely to rebound in the coming months. \"This suggests the effect of policy easing is being transmitted to the economy and reinforces our view that growth has bottomed in second quarter at 7.6% and will rebound in the third quarter to 8.1%,\" said Zhang Zhiwei, chief economist at Nomura. The PMI is a key indicator of activity in the manufacturing sector. A reading above 50 shows expansion, while one below that, indicates contraction. The HSBC PMI reading has remained below the threshold 50 mark for the past nine months. China's manufacturing sector has been hurt by falling demand from key markets such as the US and eurozone. And as those regions continue to grapple with economic issues and slower growth, there have been concerns that China's manufacturing may slow further. Analysts said that even though the latest data indicated that the pace of contraction had slowed, the sector had yet to fully recover. \"China's manufacturing slowdown momentum has yet to be fully reversed,\" Qu Hongbin, Co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC said in a statement. \"The current PMI reading remains below break-even level.\" As demand from its key overseas markets has declined and the pace of its economic growth slowed, China's policymakers have taken steps to ease monetary policy in a bid to boost domestic demand and sustain growth. China's central bank has cut its key interest rates twice in the past two months. It has also lowered the amount of cash banks must hold in reserve, thrice in the past few months, in a bid to boost lending in the country.

Not to be abused, but to preserve and utilise.\" The Pacific Remote Islands Area consists of seven scattered islands, atolls and reefs that lie between Hawaii and American Samoa. The waters that surround these islands are home to corals, seabirds, sharks and vegetation not found anywhere else in the world. President George W Bush set up the marine preserve in 2009 but until now it only encompassed an area 50 nautical miles (92km) from the islands' shores. Now the protected area is being expanded to 200 nautical miles from the unique atolls. It will cover 490,000 sq miles (1.2m sq km) - an area roughly three times the size of California. Mr Obama first signalled his intention to expand the monument in June and asked for comments on the final boundaries from fishermen, lawmakers and scientists. Environmental groups greeted the announcement and said they hoped it would spur other nations to take similar steps. \"The president acted expeditiously, while the area is still largely pristine and undisturbed,\" said Frances Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. However, some critics say the expansion falls short of what Mr Obama could have done had he used the full extent of his powers. The islands affected are divided into five regions and the expansion only involves three of them. If Mr Obama had expanded the preserve in all five regions he could have protected more than 780,000 sq miles, some environmentalists say.", "question": "US President Barack Obama has signed a memorandum to expand a vast marine @placeholder in the Pacific Ocean .", "option_0": "reserve", "option_1": "develops", "option_2": "crisis", "option_3": "role", "option_4": "scandal", "label": 0}

{"article": "Only Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Everton striker Romelu Lukaku were able to break the duopoly. Almost 125,000 people picked their team over the weekend from a shortlist of 100 players. You picked nine of the players who made BBC pundit Garth Crooks' team of the season. But why are they playing 4-4-2? Why was Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho unlucky to miss out? Who was picked most often? Who received the fewest nominations? Let's take a look at the data. A three-man defence may have been the most talked-about tactical tweak of the season but BBC Sport readers are more Mike Bassett than Antonio Conte. The most popular of the 12 possible formations picked was the trusty 4-4-2, accounting for 52% of teams. And, with 73% of users selecting a formation with four defenders, and 65% picking a team with two forwards, that's the way our team have to line up. Of the 10 goalkeepers available to choose from, De Gea was the clear choice, being selected in 30% of all teams. He was the 12th most-popular selection overall, but we cannot justify putting the 11th - Coutinho - in goal, so De Gea gets the nod. Thibaut Courtois was the next most-popular keeper, with Sunderland's Jordan Pickford ahead of Hugo Lloris of Tottenham. Thirteen goalkeepers made more saves than De Gea this season (74) but the Spaniard can boast a 72% save percentage. Burnley's Tom Heaton made the most saves all season (141), but he was picked by just 11% of you. Four defenders were a distance clear of the pack - Chelsea trio David Luiz, Marcos Alonso and Cesar Azpilicueta joined by Tottenham centre-back Toby Alderweireld. Alonso has played most of the season as a wing-back, with Azpilicueta in a back three, but they were most often picked at full-back. Alderweireld was picked in 58% of teams, more than 12% more than any other defender. He is one of five players to appear in more than half the teams picked. Azpilicueta was the only player to play in all 30 of Chelsea's league wins this season, keeping the most clean sheets (16) into the bargain. Spurs full-back Kyle Walker was the fifth most-popular defender but still misses out by a large margin. In a midfield four, three of the selections were obvious. Tottenham's Dele Alli was the most-selected player in any position, with 77% of teams containing the England man. An overwhelming majority picked him in midfield and not attack. Alli scored more goals (18) than any other midfielder this season. Chelsea duo Eden Hazard and player of the year N'Golo Kante were not far behind, with the Belgian making 72% of the teams and Kante 70%. Hazard's selections were split between midfield and attack, but only 20% of people played him in a front three, so he plays on the wing. Yes, Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez would have a bit of settling-in to do on the right wing - and his selection is problematic. Coutinho was the fourth most-selected midfielder, but Sanchez was the ninth most-selected player overall, chosen in 7% more teams than the Liverpool man. He has to play somewhere. Confused? Well BBC Sport users picked Sanchez across midfield and attack, and with a 4-4-2 formation already decided, the Chilean is doing a job wide right. From a statistical point of view, Manchester City man Kevin de Bruyne may consider himself unlucky to miss out. The Belgian had more assists (18) and created more big chances (24) than any other midfielder, but only made it into 24% of teams. He was the sixth most-popular midfielder, just behind another unfortunate player, Spurs' Christian Eriksen. He scored seven goals in the last four days of the season, 29 in total in the league including four hat-tricks, and was picked by 77% of users. Harry Kane was a shoo-in. In fact it may be easier to ask who the 23% who left him out were. Kane was in more than double the teams featuring Lukaku, who was still a long way clear of Sanchez, the third most-popular forward. Sergio Aguero scored more goals in all competitions (33) this season than before for Manchester City, but made just 9% of teams. He was only the seventh most-popular forward. Fewer than 1% of readers picked versatile West Ham duo Michail Antonio and Manuel Lanzini in attack, while Middlesbrough forward Alvaro Negredo has the dishonour of being the least selected player from the 100-man list.", "question": "Chelsea and Tottenham were the two outstanding teams in the Premier League in 2016 - 17 - and it 's no surprise players from the two London clubs @placeholder the team of the season picked by BBC Sport users .", "option_0": "dominate", "option_1": "enjoying", "option_2": "inspired", "option_3": "negotiated", "option_4": "assessed", "label": 0}
{"article": "However I have now encountered a new justification - official briefing papers that apparently cannot be shown to the public because they are too succinct and not verbose enough. This involves documents prepared by the civil service to brief the then Labour leader Neil Kinnock if he became prime minister following the 1992 general election. The information commissioner has just ruled that officials would react to the release of these papers by no longer writing \"succinct and focused\" briefings for incoming prime ministers. He has backed the government view that instead they would compose documents that are \"excessively detailed\" and \"verbose\". I requested the material in November 2012 under the Freedom of Information Act, because I thought it could be of substantial historical interest to learn more about how the civil service prepared for the possibility of Lord Kinnock (as he now is) taking over as prime minister. Although in fact Sir John Major remained in 10 Downing Street with a 21-seat Conservative majority, a Labour victory had seemed a plausible possibility to many in the run up to the election, in line with much of the opinion polling. I also thought that since more than 20 years had passed, publishing the information now would not have a damaging effect on the candour of comparable briefings in the future. After the Cabinet Office rejected my FOI request, I complained to the information commissioner, who has now issued a decision that largely dismisses my appeal. According to the commissioner's ruling, the government argued that releasing these documents would result in future ones being more verbose. The ruling says: \"It was not asserted that disclosure would necessarily make briefings less frank. Instead the briefings would be drafted with an eye on likely future publication and would be more likely to be excessively detailed - the Cabinet Office used the description 'verbose'.\" This was the opinion of the attorney general, Dominic Grieve, the minister who normally considers FOI applications that relate to previous governments. His stance was upheld by the commissioner, who ruled that disclosing most of the material requested would be against the public interest. The ruling states: \"In reaching this view, the Commissioner has had particular regard for the public interest in ensuring that briefings for incoming prime ministers in the future are succinct and focused.\" The commissioner praises the style in which the briefings are written and concurs that this approach would be less likely in future if this material from 1992 is disclosed now. Ironically Lord Kinnock himself had a reputation for verbosity, but it's not clear whether this is connected to the determination of officials to write succinct briefing papers for him. The commissioner does not entirely back the government. He criticises the Cabinet Office for its delay in taking 71 working days while reviewing its initial refusal of my request. And his judgment reveals that he had to serve a formal information notice on the Cabinet Office to obtain access to the withheld material so that his staff could assess it. The Commissioner also ruled that  a \"small section\" of the requested information should be released. This could lead one to believe that this material, such as it is and whatever it consists of, is already sufficiently encumbered by twisted grammatical constructions, completely unnecessary detail, pointless and futile repetition, not to mention rambling irrelevancies, and indeed quite possibly a wide variety of other attributes which tend to seriously undermine, if not altogether destroy, the clarity of reading matter and thereby also tend to boost the verbosity rating (perhaps measured on a scale of 1 to 10) of an official briefing paper, that it is deemed by the relevant authorities in this case to be fully suitable for public consumption already, without the otherwise necessary addition of any further clauses or sub-clauses or additional pointless repetition to prevent it from possessing the undesirable status of being regarded as excessively succinct and focused. But I don't know that for sure, since the commissioner's reasoning for ordering the publication of this information is only laid out in a confidential annex to his decision. The government has 35 days to comply. Meanwhile I am left perplexed by the notion that Cabinet Office civil servants who are perfectly capable of writing succinct and focussed briefings would apparently prefer to be perceived publicly as if they were part of a Dickensian Circumlocution Office.", "question": "As a journalist who often makes freedom of information requests I have come across a range of reasons from public authorities for @placeholder documents secret .", "option_0": "violating", "option_1": "barring", "option_2": "controversial", "option_3": "proposed", "option_4": "keeping", "label": 4}

{"article": "Charlie Miller created tools that forced phones to visit websites seeded with attack software. The software on the booby-trapped websites helped Mr Miller look at and steal data held on a handset. NFC is becoming increasingly common in smartphones as the gadgets are used as electronic tickets and digital wallets. Mr Miller, a research consultant at security firm Accuvant, demonstrated the work at the Black Hat hacker conference in Las Vegas. During his presentation, Mr Miller showed how to attack three separate phones: the Samsung Nexus S, the Google Galaxy Nexus - which both run Android - and the Nokia N9, which runs on the MeeGo system. To attack the phones Mr Miller wrote software to control a reader tag that works in conjunction with NFC. As its name implies, NFC works when devices are brought close together or are placed near a reader chip. In one demo Mr Miller piped commands through his custom-built chip that abused a feature of the smartphones known as Android beam. This allows phone owners to send links and information over short distances to other handsets. He discovered that the default setting in Android Beam forces a handset to visit any weblink or open any file sent to it. Via this route he forced handsets to visit websites that ran code written to exploit known vulnerabilities in Android. \"The fact that, without you doing anything, all of a sudden your browser is going to my website, is not ideal,\"             Mr Miller told tech news website Ars Technica . In one demonstration using this attack Mr Miller was able to view files on a target handset. On the Nokia phone, Mr Miller demonstrated how to abuse NFC and take complete control of a target handset, making it send texts or make calls, via the weaknesses exploited by his customised radio tag. Mr Miller said that to successfully attack the Android phones they must be running a particular version of the operating system, be unlocked and have their screen active.

{"article": "In other words, the economy is producing more than it has ever produced before - so should we not feel more prosperous than ever before? The trouble is that overall gross domestic product (GDP) is not necessarily what makes us feel prosperous. Since 2008, the population has grown by more than 2.5 million and the number of people in work has gone up by 1.1 million. That means that while GDP has returned to its pre-crisis level, GDP per head and GDP per worker are still well below that level, which means that productivity is also down. Lower productivity is reflected in a fall of about 9% in average earnings since 2008, adjusted for inflation. GDP is not the only measure that has recently returned to pre-recession levels. The employment rate rose to 73.1% between March and May this year, rising above its 2008 level for the first time. Interest rates are still at the low rate of 0.5% - in January 2008 they were at 5.5%, so if you have had a mortgage over that period you should be feeling better, while net savers may be feeling worse. Whether you're feeling better may have something to do with which sector you work in. It is the service sector that has dragged GDP above its 2008 level - if you work in manufacturing or construction you're still considerably below that point. The real household income figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies don't make terribly cheerful reading for anyone. The income of the median household (that's the household for which half of households have a higher income and half have a lower one) has fallen by about Â£20 per week, after adjusting for inflation, since 2008. The household at the 90th percentile (that's the one for which only 10% of households have a higher income) has seen its income fall by about Â£60 a week. At the other end of the spectrum, the household at the 10th percentile has seen a Â£2 per week increase. So there is room for celebration, with the UK economy growing faster than its competitors and more people employed than before the recession.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who called the meeting, told German newspaper Bild: \"Every day counts.\" If no agreement is reached, he added, \"we will soon see families in cold rivers in the Balkans perish miserably\". Leaders from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, are taking part in the summit. The draft statement calls for the \"gradual and controlled\" movement of people through the migration route. It also proposes to bolster EU patrols at Greece's borders and to send 400 extra guards to Slovenia. Hungary announced it was closing its borders with Serbia and Croatia last weekend. As a result, Slovenia saw 58,000 arrivals in the week leading up to Saturday, and many people are waiting in wet and cold conditions. The Slovenian government has accused Croatia of deliberately dumping thousands of migrants on the border. Croatia says it has no choice because Slovenia is allowing far less into the country than it should be. Fears of Germany and Austria closing their own borders have led Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia to threaten to do so. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov said the three countries would not \"become buffer zones\". Slovenia's President Borut Pahor said on his Facebook page, Mr Pahor said the success of Sunday's summit would be measured partly on whether stricter controls are implemented to stop migrants travelling from Turkey to Greece. Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said such controls were the only solution. \"Everything else is a waste of time,\" he said. The International Organization for Migration said that more than 9,000 migrants arrived in Greece every day last week - the highest rate so far this year.

{"article": "Officials said the six men who had stormed the transport ministry facility and taken several hostages were killed. Two policemen who had been guarding the building also died, they added. But one security source put the toll at 18. No group has claimed responsibility, though Sunni militants linked to al-Qaeda have mounted similar attacks. Violence has surged across Iraq in the past year, reaching levels not seen since the height of the sectarian insurgency in 2007. The United Nations says 7,818 civilians and 1,050 members of the security forces died in 2013. More than 900 people are reported to have been killed since the start of the year. The brazen assault on the transport ministry facility in the capital's north-east began just after midday. Officials told the AFP news agency that the attackers had all been wearing explosive vests and had initially tried to detonate a car bomb at the entrance to the building. When it did not explode, one of the men blew himself up to clear the way for the others, the officials added. A second man then detonated his suicide vest at an inner gate. The four remaining militants then held a number of people hostage for several hours before they were killed by security forces, interior ministry spokesman Gen Saad Maan told the BBC. One of the police guards who died had been at an entrance and the other had been in charge of monitoring security cameras, he said. A senior security source told the Reuters news agency that the militants killed at least 18 people including themselves and four hostages. It is not clear who the others were. During the operation security forces sealed off the surrounding area, which is also home to the transport ministry's headquarters and a human rights ministry building. Also on Thursday, at least four people were killed by a car bomb in the northern Kasra district of Baghdad, according to the Associated Press. Nine people were killed in bombings in the capital on Wednesday night.

The move follows separate legal action made by the British Medical Association last week seeking a judicial review. A Department of Health spokesman said legal action was \"expensive\" for all parties and \"totally unwarranted\". The news comes before Wednesday's planned 48-hour strike affecting routine and non-urgent care is due to start. The strike will be the fourth time doctors have taken industrial action in the long-running dispute. Just Health alleges government's decision to impose the contract, affecting about 45,000 medics,  did not allow for adequate consultation. The group raised the £100,000 through a crowdfunding website which remains open to donations. Dr Marie-Estella McVeigh, from Just Health, said: \"We feel this contract imposition has been rushed through without appropriate consideration and due process. \"There is no evidence that it will deliver a safer system or better quality care for our patients; it will instead exacerbate the staffing crisis we are already struggling with across the NHS.\" The BMA, in its legal claim, alleges that the government failed to \"pay due regard\" to the equalities impact of the new contracts and is calling for a judicial review. Talks between the government and BMA broke down in January, prompting the government to announce the following month that it would be imposing the contract in the summer. Ministers have said the changes, which will see doctors paid less for working weekends, are needed to improve care at weekends and create a \"seven-day service\". This is disputed by the BMA. Currently, junior doctors are paid more for working unsocial hours at night or at the weekend. But under the imposed new contracts, the Saturday day shift will be paid at a normal rate in return for a rise in basic pay.

{"article": "The Education Authority (EA) said the department had instructed them to cut the amount spent on school uniform grants by £3m. That would mean £1.9m is available in 2017/18, compared to £4.9m in 2016/17. The department said that it faced \"major financial pressures in 2017-18 if it is to operate within its budget\". \"Consequently options to reduce spending across all programme areas are being explored, including the clothing allowance (uniform grants), extended schools and the entitlement framework,\" it said. About 98,000 pupils in Northern Ireland received a grant this year. The most that any individual pupil can receive is £78 which helps pay for uniform and PE kit for post-primary pupils. The instruction by the department to make the proposed cut was discussed at the most recent board meeting of the EA. An EA spokesperson told the BBC: \"In its recent Resource Budget Allocation letter, the Department of Education has instructed the Education Authority to make certain spending cuts to achieve budget savings. \"These include a reduction of £3m for school uniform grants.\" The BBC understands that, if implemented, the reduction in funding of about 60% would not reduce the number of applicants, but would reduce the amount of support each would receive. The school clothing allowance scheme helps pupils from low income families in primary, post-primary and special schools. Primary school pupils can receive £35.75 towards uniform costs. Post-primary and special school pupils can receive £51 towards their uniform if they are under 15 years old and £56 if they are over 15. Post-primary and special school pupils can also receive £22 towards paying for school PE kit. However, if the cut were implemented, each pupil would receive a reduced amount towards their school uniform. The department also confirmed that extended schools funding is being reduced by about £1.5m. Just over £10.6m was provided to around 400 schools in 2016-17 and this is being cut to £9.1m in 2017/18.

{"article": "The European Commission's authorisation process is controversial. The latest approvals were condemned by Green MEPs and Greenpeace environmentalists. Fifty-eight GM crops are already used in food and animal feed in the EU. But cultivation is restricted to just one - a type of maize. US biotech firms want the rules eased. The 17 new crop authorisations consist of: soybean (five types), cotton (seven types), maize (three types) and oilseed rape (two types). Cottonseed meal and oil is used in animal feed. GM crops are used widely in the US, South America and Asia, but many Europeans are wary of their impact on health and wildlife. In the EU, 60% of animal feed is imported. The protein-rich soya in that feed comes overwhelmingly from countries that plant GM soybeans - Brazil, Argentina and the US, the Commission says. GM in food is one of the toughest issues at the EU-US talks on a free trade deal, known as TTIP. Green MEP Bart Staes, a food safety specialist, accused the Commission of ignoring widespread opposition to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) among EU citizens. \"This gung-ho approach to GMOs also has to be seen in the context of the EU-US TTIP negotiations and the long-running US campaign to force their GMOs on to the EU market,\" he said. On Wednesday, the Commission proposed a new law allowing individual EU countries to restrict or ban imported GM crops, even if those crops have been authorised EU-wide by the European Food Safety Authority (Efsa). A country would have to justify its opt-out from a certain GM crop type, stating specific national or regional grounds for the restriction. Social or environmental impact could be cited as justification for a national ban, rather than purely health concerns. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the proposal left the US \"very disappointed\" and he called it \"hard to reconcile with the EU's international obligations\". The only GM crop cultivated in the EU - Monsanto's maize variety MON 810 - is banned in several EU countries. Spain is by far the biggest grower of MON 810 in Europe, but the crop accounts for just 1.56% of the EU's total maize-growing area.

Teaching unions had warned that using a choice of tests would be problematic. National Union of Teachers' Christine Blower said: \"Flaws in the scheme were well known to Early Years educators.\" The NUT general secretary added: \"They were pointed out to the Department for Education when it first consulted on the scheme. \"The attempt to make baseline work has cost millions, has prevented children from settling into their school and increased the workload of their teachers.\" She added that it was \"disingenuous\" of the Department for Education to describe the scheme as \"optional\". The DfE had said any school wishing to have the progress of their pupils reflected in primary school league tables, rather than just their raw results, would have to adopt one of the three baseline tests on offer from this September. And hundreds of schools piloted the baseline tests last year. Ms Blower said: \"It (the DfE) pulled out all the stops to get schools to sign up and now, without a word of self-criticism for the months of disruption it brought to schools, it has pulled the plug.\" The NASUWT teaching union pointed out that the baseline assessment was to be a \"core element of the DfE's proposed reforms\" to the school accountability system. Chris Keates, its general secretary, said it was \"another example of the DfE failing to listen to teachers and school leaders in the development of  policy\". \"The NASUWT made clear from the outset that using different assessments to establish a common baseline was an approach that would always create problems in terms of the comparability of the outcomes produced by these different systems.\" The DfE said, in a statement on Thursday, that it had always intended to carry out a comparability study of the three systems and the results meant that to use them as a baseline for a progress measure \"would be inappropriate and unfair to schools\". But it stressed the government remained committed to measuring the progress of pupils through primary school and would \"continue to look at the best way to assess pupils in the early years\". Schools are free to continue to use the systems they have bought into, with the basic costs of these being borne by the DfE. But Russell Hobby, head of the National Association of Head Teachers, said it was not clear how many schools would do this. He added: \"Heads will be quite annoyed at the cost in terms of time and effort put into the baseline assessment. \"They will have had to evaluate the different providers. Some of the systems required significant training to use them like sending a member of staff on a day's training.\" Liz Marsden, founder and director of Early Excellence, said her organisation would continue provide its assessment, EExBA, and work with schools. \"For us, and the whole early years community, learning is defined by more than academic attainment.

The government has given assurances that China will run only commercial operations from the port, on the main shipping route between Asia and Europe. Sri Lanka's government says money from the deal will help repay foreign loans. Under the proposal, a state-run Chinese company will have a 99-year lease on the port and about 15,000 acres nearby for an industrial zone. The plan envisages the eviction of thousands of villagers but the government says they will be given new land. China has pumped millions of dollars into Sri Lanka's infrastructure since the end of a 26-year civil war in 2009. Hambantota port, overlooking the Indian Ocean, is expected to play a key role in China's Belt and Road initiative, otherwise known as the new Silk Road, which will link ports and roads between China and Europe. The initiative is being keenly watched by regional trade rivals including India and Japan. Opponents of the project said they feared the area being turned into a Chinese colony. There were also concerns that the Chinese navy could use the port as a base. In a move to ease those concerns, the Sri Lankan government announced a revised deal to cut the Chinese firm's stake to 70%. Officials also made assurances that the port would not be used by the Chinese military. \"We are giving the country a better deal without any implications on security,\" Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told reporters on Friday.

Mr Parker used his speech to highlight the need for surveillance powers to be brought in line with modern technology. \"Today the conversations of our adversaries are happening on a bewildering array of devices and digital platforms, often provided by companies based overseas,\" he said. \"And an increasing proportion of such communications are now beyond our reach - in particular with the growing prevalence of sophisticated encryption.\" He said MI5 needed the tools to access terrorists' communications online \"just as much as we intercepted written communications and telephone calls in years gone by\".

Government aircraft on Tuesday bombed besieged rebel-held eastern districts of the city of Aleppo for the first time in three weeks, activists said.

How can he deal with it? That's why for us it's still dubious... That's why we are very cautious in judging him.\" Current US policy is to strike against IS and other jihadists while supporting moderate rebels opposed to President Assad. Mr Assad regards those groups as terrorists. Some US media, including the New York Times, have suggested Mr Trump is likely to end aid for the rebels fighting Mr Assad because \"we have no idea who these people are\". He has said fighting Syria could lead to fighting Russia and during the election campaign he had shown admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Mr Cardoso denies the allegations. Brasif also says Ms Dutra was paid for work she did for them and the former leader had nothing to do with it. Ms Dutra worked as a reporter for Brazil's Globo TV for 35 years, losing her job last December. \"I don't want to take this to my grave,\" she said said in interview with Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Mr Cardoso has acknowledged the six-year-long affair with her, which came to an end before he became president of Brazil.

{"article": "Sadly that is far from the case, and in practice, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get definitive rulings in international law involving military intervention. There is no international court on hand to give the legal go-ahead to intervene. However, there is a developing legal framework for military intervention on humanitarian grounds. Known as the Responsibility to Protect, or R2P, it was born out of the humanitarian disasters of the 1990s in Kosovo and Rwanda. It is widely but not universally accepted and has three principal elements: In order to have maximum legitimacy, military intervention should be authorised by the UN Security Council.  It holds a unique position as the primary arbiter on the use of force in international law. However, as in the case of Syria, it may be hamstrung by a lack of consensus, with one or more members opposed to action. In these situations, according to one view, R2P provides a legal framework for the international community to use military force as a last resort - either by way of a regional coalition or a so-called \"coalition of the willing\". There are a number of safeguards in R2P: In other words, it is a limited power to act.  However, if all of the criteria are met, then the limited and targeted use of military force would be legal in international law under R2P, some lawyers and commentators believe. Ultimately though, military interventions in these circumstances are up to governments rather than lawyers. It is for them to make the case for military intervention by showing that the legal requirements have been met. In the case of Syria, they will argue that there is an ongoing atrocity, all peaceful means of stopping it have been exhausted, and that targeted military action could achieve the twin goals of ending the atrocity and protecting the civilian population.", "question": "The words \" international law \" @placeholder the sense of a set of established international rules and authorities agreed by all nations , and easily understood and applied by them .", "option_0": "pondering", "option_1": "convey", "option_2": "reduce", "option_3": "dominates", "option_4": "reducing", "label": 1}

{"article": "But the penalty has only been waived for individuals who provide a \"reasonable\" excuse for being late. The development was disclosed  to the Daily Telegraph, via a leaked memo, and could affect up to 890,000 people. A spokesman for HMRC said it wanted to focus more resources \"on investigating major tax avoidance and evasion\". The Telegraph report says the internal memo asks tax officials to remit fines without further investigation for those people who could show mitigating circumstances, and who appealed against the fine after their tax return was sent in. HMRC is facing a backlog of almost a million letters and staff have been taken off call centre duties to work through the mail, according to the paper. The deadline for self-assessment returns was midnight on 31 January, and as many as 890,000 people missed it, the Telegraph says. It quotes the memo as saying: \"Our penalty regime is intended to influence customer behaviour, but also be clear and cost-effective, fair and proportionate. \"The current way of managing penalties does not meet these objectives, and so we have decided to take a more proportionate approach where a customer has filed their return late, and then appealed against their penalty… \"This means that in the vast majority of cases we will be accepting the customer's grounds for appeal, and we can cancel the penalty.\" On its website HMRC lists excuses it regards as acceptable for late payment. These include the death of a family member, a stay in hospital, a computer failure, fire, or postal delays. Paul Lewis, the presenter of BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme, said the list was \"quite broad\" and included reasons officials originally said they were unlikely to accept. \"This isn't an amnesty. If you filed late and you've got a penalty and you haven't appealed then you will have to pay. But if you appealed, and by now have filled the form in, then the chances are, the overwhelming majority - that's the phrase HMRC use - will be accepted.\" He said the move coincided with a fall in the number of staff at HMRC. But the Money Box presenter added the HMRC does appear to have been successful in its aim of increasing overall receipts by concentrating efforts on \"serious tax avoiders\". A spokesman for the UK's tax authority said that HMRC had \"always accepted\" those with a reasonable excuse should have a penalty waived, and it was now \"expediting that process\".

About 50,000 British women may have these implants. The body for plastic surgeons warned against alarm, but said those with PIPs needed a check-up within six months. If an ultrasound establishes that the implant is weakened or ruptured, then both should be removed, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) advised. \"This is certainly an unusual situation but so far there is no serious cause for alarm - whilst further tests are conducted into the substance, we recommend that women who've undergone breast augmentation contact their surgeons to find out what type of implant was used,\" said its president Nigel Mercer \"If it's PIP they should have an ultrasound in the next six months to establish whether there is any weakening or rupture.  At present removal is recommended in these cases, but if there is one ruptured implant, the contralateral one should be taken out as well, as a preventative measure.\" In March, The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said no more PIPs should be implanted and that any remaining should be returned to the manufacturer. The French company which produced PIPs has gone into administration. All the devices were recalled in France earlier this year. The inquiry by the French association of plastic surgeons reported that the company had from 2005 dispensed with the protective barrier and was also using a gel with a composition different from that approved. To determine how the altered version might react with the human body, BAAPs says French colleagues contacted the gel manufacturers for any studies. There were none, as they had understood the substance to be intended for use in mattresses. Nigel Mercer added that surgeons who had fitted PIPs should not be held accountable for doing so. \"There was no way of knowing the gel was untested or that the protective envelope, which adds strength and restricts the gel from travelling into the body, had been dispensed with.\" PIPs were among the cheaper brands of breast implants available.

To make sense of this baffling pay award we need to look at what we mean by failure. BP had two very big challenges to overcome last year. One was industry wide, one specific to BP. The oil price crash which started in in June 2014 punched a hole in oil company profits across the board. Old rival Shell saw its profits slump by 80%. It would be hard to argue that the oil crash was Bob Dudley's \"fault\". The formula for his pay relates to how well BP did relative to other oil companies. On this measure Bob Dudley was a success. BP shares fell less than Shell, Chevron or Exxon in 2015. The second challenge BP faced was the shadow cast by the Deepwater Horizon disaster of 2010 which cost 11 people their lives and cost the company $50bn. Settling the bill for this disaster and reshaping the company in its aftermath was the key challenge of Bob Dudley's career and this was the year he concluded that. He also reportedly exceeded safety at work targets set after the accident.

Mr Jones argued it gives further urgency to the need to cut the number of councils from the current 22. A recent report recommended cutting the number by about half. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents the councils, said improvements were being made. Torfaen, Monmouthshire, Merthyr Tydfil, Anglesey, Blaenau Gwent and Pembrokeshire LEAs are all in special measures, meaning their education services have been judged not good enough. Government and officials are monitoring how they improve the situation. Mr Jones, in an interview with BBC Wales as part of its Measuring Devolution series, said that demonstrates the need to reorganise the way local government provides education. Councils have already lost some of the responsibility to drive up standards in our schools. That job is now in the hands of four education consortia. Mr Jones said: \"It's quite clear with six local education authorities in special measures, how can we have faith there will be consistent good delivery of education across Wales? \"That's why of course we need to make sure the future structure of local government delivers in the way we want it to. \"We need to make sure that local authorities are delivering consistently and that's not happening at the moment.

The Labour Party is due to agree its proposed new local government map for Wales this summer. WLGA chief executive Steve Thomas said the issue will be debated at a conference next week, adding \"it is time to accentuate some of the positives and not just the negative\". \"The WLGA and local government is part of the system of education and we should all be pulling together to ensure that education outcomes are improved,\" he said. \"We have seen some really good inspections of late, not least of all Ceredigion. \"We are expecting further improvements in those areas where local authorities are currently in special measures.\"", "question": "First Minister Carwyn Jones has told BBC Wales he thinks some councils are @placeholder of improving education in their area .", "option_0": "accused", "option_1": "deserving", "option_2": "capable", "option_3": "incapable", "option_4": "emerging", "label": 3}

The letter says common frameworks will be necessary to protect the freedom of businesses to operate across the UK single market and to enable the UK to strike free trade deals. It adds that the need for common frameworks will also depend on the nature of any agreement with the EU.

Spieth is ranked second in the world, behind McIlroy, but the American downplayed suggestions of a rivalry between the two. \"I don't think there is much of a rivalry.

{"article": "Writing in the British Medical Journal, they suggest some patients are given pills or have tests they do not need by doctors who feel under pressure to act. They argue patients should feel able to discuss whether there are simpler, safer options that are right for them. But experts warn they must not change treatment without medical advice. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (AoMRC) says there is growing evidence that pressure for doctors to \"do something\" at each consultation has led to patients sometimes receiving treatments that are of little or no value. And the report suggests a culture of \"more is better\" means some individuals are being over-diagnosed - labelled with conditions that may in the end do them little harm. Launching the Choosing Wisely campaign, experts are calling on key medical organisations to identify five interventions each that should not be offered routinely or in some cases not at all. These might include: Prof Dame Sue Bailey, a leading psychiatrist and a main author of the report, argues many patients with mild depression could instead be offered group exercise classes or talking therapies first. And she says frequent blood tests can be particularly distressing for elderly people with frail skin. She also argues that for some patients with mildly elevated blood pressure, changing their lifestyle might be the most appropriate initial option. But other experts defend the use of these pills in mild, moderate and severe cases and the charity Blood Pressure UK warns patients to consult their doctors before changing their medicine. Nevertheless, as science advances and the evidence shifts, experts say individuals should be encouraged to check whether procedures are definitely right for them. For example, patients are advised to ask: The campaign is already under way in Canada and the United States. And while experts acknowledge that asking doctors to change familiar practices could be controversial, they say this is worthwhile if it leads to better care. Prof Bailey added: \"It's not and will never be about refusing treatment or in any way jeopardising safety. \"It is just about taking a grown-up approach to healthcare and being good stewards of the resources we have.\" And Jeremy Taylor, of the patient charity, National Voices, added his support. He said: \"The evidence shows where patients are involved in the decision, people will often choose less intervention. \"They do not ask for endless new treatments, but make appropriate - and often less costly - choices.\" Experts will evaluate each suggestion before publishing their list later this year.

The actor said he had been very close to proposing to his co-star \"but the biggest factor that stopped me was thinking that Lucy had a big mouth\". He said: \"All the articles in the Mirror's newspapers that were constantly being published about us made me suspect Lucy. \"I thought she was shouting her mouth off. Now of course I know it was nothing like this and it was the Mirror's journalists stealing information from our phones. \"Apart from our relationship, the Mirror articles also had a really profound effect on Lucy's career and how she felt as a person.\" He said she believed they were responsible \"for putting her out of work and making her unemployable, and I think she was right\". Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) has admitted publishing 17 articles about Ms Taggart between 2000 and 2006 as a result of phone hacking. Mr Richie, who plays Alfie Moon in the BBC soap, occasionally became emotional as he talked about the impact of phone hacking on his life, He said one of his colleagues on EastEnders had warned others on the set: \"Don't say anything to Shane Richie because he's 'gobby', he talks to the press\". Mr Richie said he felt \"really let down\" by the revelations and said the hacking had caused lasting damage to his relationship with friends and family. In 2003 journalists were questioning him about debt problems, caused by his investment in a film, and he was worried his wife Christie might find out. At one point he asked Christie if her mother had been talking to the press, which led to strained relations with his mother-in-law. The 50-year-old actor said that it sickened him \"to the core\" that journalists had listened to intimate voicemails left for him by his wife and children. MGN has acknowledged that hacking was used for 12 stories it published about Mr Richie between 2003 and 2005. Earlier, Premiership footballer Rio Ferdinand's ex-girlfriend broke down in tears during the hearing. Flight attendant Lauren Alcorn had a relationship with Mr Ferdinand, the QPR, and former Manchester United and England star, for several years from 2002. Ms Alcorn, who is on maternity leave from Virgin Airways, said she was \"completely shocked and disgusted\" by the activity at MGN. She said: \"My relationship with Rio was on and off for several years until about 2006. \"During this time, Rio also had a relationship with his now wife, who is also the mother of his children. \"Looking back on it now with the benefit of hindsight, that period represents a time in my life that I regret and am very embarrassed about. \"However, I was a young, naive and emotionally vulnerable 19-year-old who got wrapped up with a young man that I thought had feelings for me and vice versa. \"I'm a very private person and I never never wanted to be in the public eye - even walking into court today is my worst nightmare.\" Ms Alcorn said she had been quizzed about being with Mr Ferdinand the day before he missed a drugs test in 2003. \"It was even suggested I was a bad influence and I was the reason he missed the test. \"I felt completely hounded and bombarded by the questioning from complete strangers.\" Ms Alcorn said her voicemail also had \"such private and personal things like the death of my father.\" She said: \"To know that all of that was listened to is really upsetting.\" MGN has acknowledged that it published three stories that appeared in the Sunday Mirror in 2003 as a result of hacking Ms Alcorn's voicemail. MGN last month published an apology for phone hacking, saying the practice was \"unlawful, unacceptable and wrong\". Asked about the apology, Ms Alcorn said: \"It felt like it had no sincerity whatsoever. I wanted to rip it up and throw it in the bin\". BBC creative director Alan Yentob has told the hearing he felt \"violated on a truly massive scale\" by journalists who hacked his phone, while the former Coronation Street star Shobna Gulati said her son was bullied at school because of stories MGN published. Cases from actress Sadie Frost, former footballer Paul Gascoigne and TV producer Robert Ashworth, former husband of Coronation Street actress Tracy Shaw, are also being considered.

The changes, which affect 145 buses on seven scheduled routes in Putney, are expected to reduce bus emissions across the 12 zones by over 80%. The launch of the LEBZ comes as a recent opinion poll found nine out of 10 Londoners believe air pollution is at \"crisis\" level. A report released by the mayor last week showed that every London borough has recorded illegally high levels of air pollution in the past two years, with Wandsworth recording some of the highest levels. Wandsworth has exceeded the annual mean limit for NO2 pollution at five out of six of its automatic monitoring stations, with the sites on Putney High Street recording levels more than double the legal limit. The 11 further LEBZs will be introduced by 2020, with the Brixton to Streatham one to be launched in October.

He told detectives that she was killed by a home intruder in the US state of Connecticut on 23 December 2015. But police say her electronic device tells a different story. Mr Dabate was charged this month with murder, tampering with physical evidence and making false statements about his 39-year-old wife's death. Police say he initially told them he had just returned home at around 09:00 after dropping off his two sons when he was attacked by a home intruder. He claimed the perpetrator was a \"tall, obese man\" with a deep voice like actor Vin Diesel's and wearing \"camouflage and a mask\", according to an arrest warrant. The accused said a .357 revolver registered in his name was used by the purported attacker to shoot Mrs Dabate. The victim, a pharmaceutical representative, was shot twice, once in the back of her head, with the pistol that her husband had purchased two months earlier, say prosecutors. Mr Dabate, a computer technician, claimed the home intruder then tied him up after a struggle. Police found Mr Dabate with an arm and leg bound by zip ties to a chair in the kitchen at the crime scene. He had what police described as superficial knife wounds. Investigators say physical evidence showed no sign of the struggle described by Mr Dabate. Data found on a Fitbit that Mrs Dabate had worn for an exercise class that morning shows she did not take her last movements until 10:05, more than an hour after her husband claimed to watch her die. Also, police sniffer dogs picked up no scent of other people in the house in the hours before Mrs Dabate's death. Her husband was in a relationship with another woman, who was expecting his baby - which detectives suspect as a motive for the attack. According to investigators, Mr Dabate had texted his wife a year before her death saying: \"I want a divorce.\" Bank statements obtained by the Hartford Courant newspaper showed credit card charges from hotels and bouquets of flowers for his girlfriend, as well as strip clubs. The accused is currently not in custody after posting bail of $1m. His next trial date is scheduled for 28 April.

But the Alliance leader said that if republicans had not condemned this week's atrocity they would have been condemned for not doing so. Now they have they are condemned for hypocrisy, she added. Mrs Long told the BBC's Inside Politics programme she wanted every politician in Northern Ireland to be in a position to condemn every violent incident - past or present. She said the Manchester Arena attack was \"not our tragedy, it's Manchester's tragedy\" and people in Northern Ireland should respect the feelings of the people of Manchester and offer them solidarity and support. Mrs Long expressed her \"full confidence\" in the PSNI Chief Constable to handle the latest security situation, noting that the PSNI has a greater number of routinely armed officers than other forces, which may have helped George Hamilton reach the conclusion he does not need any extra military resources. Mrs Long denied that her party's support for a second referendum on any eventual Brexit deal is a thinly disguised attempt to reverse last year's EU referendum. She reminded the UUP, who have criticised the Alliance's stance, that democracy is a process and not just an event. She criticised the Conservatives, arguing that the narrow vote in favour of leaving the EU should have led to a moderate approach to Brexit, not what she described as Theresa May's charge towards a \"recklessly hard Brexit\".

It calls on the Bank of England to \"cease to use animal products in the production of currency that we have to use\". Hosted on the Change.org website, it states that tallow is \"unacceptable to millions of vegans, vegetarians, Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and others in the UK\". The Bank of England began issuing the polymer notes in September pledging they \"last longer, stay cleaner and are harder to counterfeit than paper notes\".

Critics say there are plant-based substitutes that could be used in its place. The response from the UK's Hindu and Sikh communities began to gather pace after vegans and vegetarians voiced their feelings on social media on Tuesday. Hindus believe cows are holy and sacred, and many do not wear shoes or carry bags made from the skin of cattle that has been slaughtered. Practising Sikhs are strict vegetarians.

Their work should make it easier to design drugs to stop brain cells dying. The researchers used brain tissue from a 74-year-old woman who died after having Alzheimer's disease. The form of dementia leads to tangles of a protein called tau spreading throughout the brain. The more tau tangles there are, the worse the  symptoms tend to be. Doctors have known this has happened for decades but what has been missing is a detailed understanding of what the tangles look like. The team took advantage of the \"resolution revolution\" in microscopy to take thousands of highly detailed images of the tau inside the woman's brain tissues. And using computer software, they figured out the tangles look like this: It is pretty meaningless to an untrained eye, but to scientists this could be one of the most important recent discoveries in tackling dementia. Attempts to develop a drug to slow the pace of dementia have been met by repeated failure.

{"article": "A study of 200,000 people showed that those with a variation in their genetic make-up were less likely to deposit fat under the skin in the lower body. This can lead the body to become resistant to the hormone insulin. The scientists said their findings explain why even slim people who eat too much and are inactive are at risk. And they added that a healthy diet and physical exercise is important, regardless of body weight. Insulin is a hormone that controls levels of blood sugar. When the body becomes resistant to it, levels of blood sugars and lipids rise, increasing the risk of diabetes and heart disease - but no-one is sure why insulin resistance happens and why some people become resistant when overweight, and others do not. International figures show that 43% of people who develop type 2 diabetes are obese, 43% are overweight and 14% have a healthy weight. The Cambridge study, published in Nature Genetics, found that a large proportion of the population has inherited some of 53 separate genetic variants that inhibit the storage of fat safely under the skin, particularly in the lower half of the body. Their fat is more likely to end up in the bloodstream or stored in and around the body's central organs. The study said people who have more of this genetic material are at much greater risk of type 2 diabetes - no matter what their BMI (body mass index) is. In the 20% of the population with the highest number of these genetic variants, their risk of diabetes rose by 39% compared to the 20% of the population with the lowest genetic risk.

{"article": "The opposition gathered 1.85 million signatures in favour of the referendum to oust President Nicolas Maduro. But the National Electoral Council has yet to say if the petition is valid. Earlier, protesters complaining against the lack of food in shops tried to march towards the presidential palace. They were blocked by police, who used tear gas to disperse the march. \"We want food!\" the protesters shouted. They had been queuing for hours outside supermarkets and shops in the area, Reuters news agency reported. \"I've been here since eight in the morning,\" a woman told pro-opposition broadcaster Vivoplay. \"We're hungry and tired.\" The opposition blames Mr Maduro's government for the serious economic crisis. Tension between the socialist government and the opposition has heightened since the latter won the parliamentary elections in December and took control of the National Assembly. The opposition Roundtable for Democracy (MUD) coalition ran on a promise to remove President Maduro from office before his term runs out in 2019. What's gone wrong in Venezuela? After a proposed constitutional amendment to shorten his term from six to four years was rejected by the Supreme Court, the MUD launched a petition to recall him. On 2 May they handed the National Electoral Council (CNE) lists with 1.85 million signatures backing a recall referendum, many more than the 197,000 needed at this initial stage. Members of President Maduro's United Socialist Party (PSUV) allege that at least 10,000 of those signatures are fraudulent. The CNE's decision on whether it accepts the petition is therefore seen as key, even though this is only the first hurdle on the road to a recall referendum. The deputy speaker of the National Assembly, opposition politician Enrique Marquez, said the recall referendum was the only \"escape valve\" for the pressure building up in Venezuela. He warned that should the referendum be blocked, social tension in Venezuela could rise to unheard-of levels. The country is deeply divided into those who support Mr Maduro's socialist policies and those who oppose him, and there have been marches by both sides. But the worsening economic situation in Venezuela, which now has the world's highest inflation rate as well as shortages of basic food and power cuts, means many people who once supported Mr Maduro are demanding change. The opposition says all its efforts to bring about change are being thwarted by the government and the judiciary, which it alleges has been stacked with supporters of Mr Maduro. International pressure on the government to sit down with the opposition to tackle the problems has also been mounting. On Tuesday, the head of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, called an emergency meeting over Venezuela's \"institutional crisis\" which could lead to the suspension of Venezuela from the regional body.

The hosts, forced to follow-on, lost regular wickets but looked comfortable on 198-6 with 10 overs left in the day. But Gareth Batty (6-51) and Stuart Meaker (4-40) took the last four wickets for three runs to seal victory. McManus and Wheal added 25 to Hampshire's overnight total of 398-9 at the Ageas Bowl before Wheal was run out before lunch, leaving Hampshire 214 runs behind. With only Ryan McLaren (59) offering real resistance with the bat in the follow-on, Hampshire slumped to 121-6. McManus and Gareth Berg looked to have steadied the ship but Surrey skipper Batty trapped the former lbw for 35 and had Gareth Andrew caught in the slips three balls later. Meaker then finished off the innings, removing Berg (38) lbw before Mason Crane was caught behind for a duck.

{"article": "The Growth and Competiveness Commission said rail improvements such as creating the South Wales Metro were vital. Closer working between local councils and building more affordable homes are also key priorities. Boosting people's skills for the jobs to be created was also recommended. The Cardiff city region deal involves 10 local councils in south east Wales aiming to create 25,000 new jobs and an extra £4bn in private sector investment. That includes a £734m investment in the new Metro, which will see Valleys electrification, longer trains, faster buses and some light rail services. The report published on Friday calls for action on a range of priorities to ensure growth and prosperity across the whole of south east Wales, including: The commission has highlighted the factors it says is holding the region back. An ageing population, not enough of the right skills for future employment, and also lack of connectivity - both digitally and in transport. The next two months are crucial.  Ten councils need to come together with a united voice. The message from the report is that they need to take the lead, and take the Welsh Government and private sector with them. They also need to get on with it. Prof Greg Clark, who has been an advisor to a number of cities including, Auckland, San Diego, London, Glasgow and Belfast, led a review into how the city deal could work. \"The Cardiff Capital Region can be more prosperous, more inclusive and more sustainable,\" he said, delivering the commission's report on Friday. \"We do not see inevitable or unresolvable tensions between the priorities we have identified. \"But the commissioners recognise that they can only be achieved if the region becomes much better connected and inter-dependent, and if investment in connectivity is used to drive changes in transport modes, new land uses, the fostering of a multi-centred economy, and improved liveability for people at all levels of income.\" Prof Kevin Morgan of Cardiff University - in a foreword to the report - reminded people of their \"shared destiny\", pointing out Cardiff would never have become \"the coal metropolis\" of the early 20th Century without the \"dramatic growth\" of the south Wales coalfields. The report warned the £1.2bn of public money being committed should be seen as \"the foundation to increase joint working and co-investment\". \"The City Deal represents a significant investment into the Cardiff Capital Region, but it cannot finance everything that is required, particularly given that much of the funding is already committed,\" it said. Lack of a clear identity was another issue - the commissioners found only one in three people surveyed thought they knew what the Cardiff Capital Region was, and the report recommended a \"single point of leadership\". Helen Molyneux, who sits on the commission, said it was vital the city region deal cash was spent \"as wisely as possible\". \"The key findings are that the local authorities work together developing a long-term strategy - not quick fixes,\" she told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales. \"Skills is a massive issue. Productivity in the region is quite low compared to the national average and it's vital that we improve people's skills, because that is the way you improve productivity.\" However, Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe said there was more to prosperity than simply measuring economic growth. She spoke of the need for an \"innovative, productive, low carbon society\" with a \"well-educated and skilled population with access to decent jobs\". The report comes as concerns were raised over whether Cardiff councillors would back the deal before May's local elections.

The plant accounts for 72% of the country's gas storage capacity, but has been affected by safety issues. The move could push the UK's gas stocks to record lows this winter. There have been problems at the Rough facility since March 2015, when Centrica imposed restrictions on storage levels because of an issue with its wells. While testing the wells involved, Centrica said, it had \"identified an additional issue\" on one of them. Gas market specialist Niall Trimble of the Energy Contract Company said the Rough facility was a key part of the UK's gas storage network. \"After all these years, it's still the majority of our storage,\" he said. Analysis: John Moylan, industry correspondent When I took the short flight to the Rough gas field in 2011, its two platforms and 30 wells were operating at full pelt. The field, which lies around 20 miles off the East Yorkshire coast, was providing gas for the UK. It's been doing that since the 1975. It was converted into our major gas storage facility a decade later. But last year, a limit was imposed on the maximum operating pressure of the facility, reducing the volume of gas stored there by about a third. The UK has been consuming less gas in recent years. And we have more sources of gas - including LNG and pipelines to Europe - than ever before. But this latest setback raises more questions about how long Rough can continue - and what will take its place? \"But it's old. These things have a finite lifetime without major refurbishment. Things start to break down. \"There's the immediate problem that we might not be able to fill it in time for winter. I suspect we might not be able to fill it completely. \"But longer term, this raises questions about how long this vital storage facility can keep operating.\" Mr Trimble said that if Europe had to endure a cold winter, it might be difficult for the UK to bolster its supplies with gas from the continent. \"If stocks look tight, we can try to source more LNG [liquefied natural gas] shipments.

But they observed that there had been less progress in some areas: \"Many of the political and scientific 'bureaucratic silos' still remain, despite frequent calls for policy integration and interdepartmental co-operation. \"It is therefore very important that large-scale emerging technologies... apply the precautionary principle based on the experiences and lessons learned.\" They added that increases in scientific knowledge had shown that the links between stressors and harm were more complex than was previously thought. \"Much of the harm described in [the reports], such as cancers or species decline, is caused by several co-causal factors acting independently or together. \"[For example], Bee Colony Collapse can be linked to viruses, climate change and nicotinoid pesticides.\" They also said that research had a tendency to focus on well documented hazards rather than investing more time and resources improving the scientific knowledge of emerging threats. \"Environmental and health research overly focuses on well-know rather than unknown hazards at the expense of emerging issues and their potential impacts,\" they concluded. \"Funding more holistic systems science would also help achieve a greater integration among the different branches of science and counteract problems such as: short-term interest outcompeting long-term vision; competition replacing co-operation ; fragmentation of information and knowledge.", "question": "Earlier action can help cut the impact of environmental threats in Europe but \" bureaucratic silos \" are causing delays , a report has @placeholder .", "option_0": "emerged", "option_1": "predicted", "option_2": "suggested", "option_3": "confirmed", "option_4": "concluded", "label": 2}

Mr Maduro has announced a cabinet reshuffle but vowed to veto any amnesty law for jailed politicians. The election result is the worst for the Socialist movement founded by late leader Hugo Chavez in 1999. The majority means the Democratic Unity coalition can now make sweeping changes, including replacing Supreme Court judges and making changes to the constitution pending approval in a referendum. It also wants the release of one of its leaders, Leopoldo Lopez, who was given a 13-year prison sentence for inciting violence - a charge critics say was politically motivated. But Mr Maduro said he would block any amnesty law. \"The murderers have to be prosecuted and have to pay,\" he said in a televised address. He said his Socialist Party would hold an \"extraordinary congress\" to find out what went wrong at the election. The opposition meanwhile warned of looming food shortages for Venezuelans. \"We urge the government to stop crying and start working,\" opposition leader Jesus Torrealba said. \"We're just a few weeks away from a very serious problem in terms of food,\" he added. The elections were widely seen as a referendum on President Maduro, the handpicked successor of Hugo Chavez, and the governing PSUV's socialist policies. The opposition accused Mr Maduro's party of mismanaging the economy and of squandering the country's oil wealth. Venezuela has been hit hard by the continuing low price of oil, its main export. It also has the continent's highest inflation rate. Mr Maduro has blamed the situation on an \"economic war\" waged by the opposition. The opposition also accused the government of increasing authoritarianism. The election result also gives stronger momentum to the opposition should it wish to call a referendum on Mr Maduro's future. This could take place only when his presidency reaches its halfway point in April next year. However, some prominent opposition figures want to give Mr Maduro the opportunity to change policies they blame for the country's economic crisis. \"If Maduro doesn't change we'll have to change the government. But the opposition's response to the economic crisis right now can't be more politics,\" Henrique Capriles - who lost to Mr Maduro in the 2013 presidential elections - told AP.

Amazon says the 1,114 defendants, termed \"John Does\" as the company does not yet know their real names, offer a false review service for as little as $5 (£3.24) on the website Fiverr.com, with most promising five-star reviews for a seller's products. \"While small in number, these reviews can significantly undermine the trust that consumers and the vast majority of sellers and manufacturers place in Amazon, which in turn tarnishes Amazon's brand,\" the technology giant said in its complaint, which was filed on Friday.

The first clearance in Admiralty on 18 November passed off peacefully. But clashes erupted the following week when the authorities demolished the entire Mong Kok camp. Student protesters accused the police of violence, and tried to shut down government offices in Admiralty on 1 December, prompting a strong response from the police. Another injunction has been granted to clear a section of Connaught and Harcourt Roads - the major stronghold of protesters. The students have insisted that public opinion is still on their side, but the numbers at protest sites and polls indicate that the public has grown increasingly weary of the disruption and unrest. At its peak, the pro-democracy movement saw tens of thousands of Hong Kong residents from all walks of life take to the streets. Two months on, just a few hundred remain camped out in tent cities, most of whom are students and young workers. Meanwhile, a mid-November poll done by the University of Hong Kong's public opinion programme found that a majority of respondents did not support the protests. A majority also backed the Hong Kong government's clearance of the sites, though some believed that it could allocate other areas for protesters. Student leaders have also found it difficult to make headway. Earlier talks with city officials proved fruitless, an attempt to travel to Beijing was blocked by Hong Kong authorities, and two leaders - Joshua Wong and Lester Shum - were arrested for obstructing police in Mong Kok and are now out on bail.

A second round of peace talks was held on Monday with separate meetings between UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and the two sides. \"The beginning of this week is as laborious as it was in the first week.

President Bashar al-Assad's government has ruled out any transfer of power. On the ground, efforts to evacuate hundreds more women, children and elderly people from Homs, which has been under siege for 18 months, were temporarily halted on Tuesday for logistical reasons.

So their fate is being scrutinised very closely, our correspondent adds. She was at a press conference on Tuesday where the Homs governor gave the latest figures on how many detainees had been released. He said he expected around 80% of those held would be let free. Matthew Hollingworth, Syria director for the UN's World Food Programme, told the BBC \"the floodgates have opened\" as many more people try to leave. \"The levels of destitution inside the Old City are like nothing I've ever seen before,\" he said. \"People are living in tunnels underground, moving between shells of buildings to find roots to eat - there has been little food for many, many months now.\" UN aid chief Valerie Amos welcomed the extension of a three-day truce on Monday.

She said that many of those who had left the city so far appeared traumatised and weak after enduring many months of siege. Writing in the UK's Independent newspaper, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague warned that the Srebrenica massacre of 1995 - when more than 8,000 men and boys were killed in a Bosnian town - could be repeated in the Old City of Homs. He said it was time to \"turn up the heat\" on the Syrian government.

However, the Scottish government did not support Mr McMahon, with concerns voiced about a provision which would require two thirds of a jury to support any verdict. MSPs voted 80 to 28 against the bill. Speaking to his bill, Mr McMahon said it was essential the Scottish justice system was transparent and fully understood by all members of society. He said the public believed a not proven verdict carried a degree of culpability, with the impression that the accused \"got away with it\". He said this also left victims confused and disappointed. Mr McMahon also proposed increasing the majority required to convict a defendant to two-thirds of the jury, saying convictions must be robust to justify removing the not proven verdict. Holyrood's justice committee said the not proven verdict was living on \"borrowed time\" and may not serve any purpose, but was split on whether to support the bill due to the jury majority provision. Convener Christine Grahame said a \"clear majority\" of the committee had backed the former proposal, but not the latter, and called for the matter to be included in an examination of the justice system by Lord Bonomy. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson praised Mr McMahon for his efforts in bringing the bill to the chamber, but also opposed it because of the jury requirement and Lord Bonomy's review. He said Scotland has one of the largest jury sizes in the world, at 15, and said there would need to be \"a strong evidence base\" and research of juries before such a change was made. Mr McMahon did win support from fellow Labour MSPs, including Elaine Murray, who said the highest use of the verdict was in rape cases. Another Labour member, former senior policeman Graeme Pearson, said victims could be \"left in limbo\" by the verdict.

When asked by detectives why he had become disillusioned in Syria, Mr Bradley said he was not sure but that it may have been because of the bombs.

{"article": "MP Steve Baker called for an end to \"personal nastiness\" warning \"deep divisions\" in the party were emerging. Both campaigns have traded barbs - with Boris Johnson at odds with David Cameron and Lord Heseltine this week. A Downing Street spokesman said \"we don't accept\" Mr Baker's claims. In other EU referendum campaign developments: The government is campaigning for a vote to remain in the EU in the 23 June referendum and Prime Minister David Cameron, whose party is divided on the issue, has previously called for a \"respectful\" debate. But in an article for the ConservativeHome website, Mr Baker, the co-chairman of Conservatives for Britain, said he had found the recent debate \"breathtakingly disheartening\". Former London mayor Mr Johnson also sparked a row by referring to Barack Obama's \"part-Kenyan\" ancestry after the US president backed a vote to remain, and described international figures backing the government's case as appearing in \"Downing Street hostage videos\". Mr Baker pinned the blame on the Remain campaign - which he said had descended \"into insults, personal attacks and petty tabloid smears on key people\". He criticised Chancellor George Osborne's dismissal of the Brexit case as \"economically illiterate\" and cited the example of Lord Heseltine, who told the BBC he would be \"very surprised\" if Mr Johnson became prime minister after his \"preposterous, obscene\" remarks. \"I was appalled that such a distinguished figure as Lord Heseltine was used by Downing Street to attack Boris Johnson and convert the debate into one on personality not policy,\" said Mr Baker. Another leading Leave campaigner, former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith, dismissed Lord Heseltine as \"from the past\" following his intervention. Mr Baker claimed there had been \"intolerable media smears\" against leading Leave figures and their families, adding: \"It is a dark day indeed when Conservatives believe that the centre is behind such vicious briefing.\" He added: \"If we're to come together after this referendum, personal nastiness must end now.\" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme he said the Remain campaign \"can't make an honest and positive case\" because they \"know it's a losing argument\". \"So we've been reduced to fear, uncertainty and doubt on the Remain side, and lashing out at individuals,\" he said. He added: \"What essentially I'm saying is Queensberry Rules - so a full-frontal assault with due warning is fine - but the dagger in the heart inserted from the back through whispering in dark corridors is not OK.\" A Downing Street spokesman said: \"We don't accept Steve Baker's article. \"All our arguments are rooted in the thought that we are stronger, safer and better off in the EU.\" The spokesman expressed confidence that the Conservative Party would be able to unite after the referendum. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said Mr Baker was wrong, and added: \"Arguments have been made forcefully on both sides.\" In other EU referendum news, former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg said a UK vote to leave the EU could hit UK-EU trade and leave British-based \"employees worse off\".

But Mr Brokenshire said he is very much looking forward to the discussions. Voters go to the polls on 2 March after the power-sharing executive collapsed over a botched energy scheme. Asked about whether it would be useful to introduce an independent chair for the legacy elements of the talks, the secretary of state said the focus should be on using the three-week period after the election to get the Stormont Executive back up and running. \"As secretary of state for Northern Ireland, I take the lead responsibility for the UK government and I very much look forward to getting into discussions with the parties immediately following the election, doing all that I can to support work to get us back into devolved government,\" he said. In an article for the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Brokenshire wrote that there was a \"disproportionate focus\" on the investigation of Troubles killings carried out by former soldiers and police officers. Since then, the PSNI Legacy Branch has released figures showing that killings by the Army account for only about 30% of its workload. Asked whether these figures contradicted his view, the secretary of state insisted that the overall framework for dealing with the past was not as balanced as it should be. \"I think that there is an issue in relation to the overall framework, the systems that are frankly not delivering for anyone in relation to legacy. That is why I do feel very keenly that we do need reform,\" he said. He said one objective of any future talks would be to \"create a system that starts to work, because at the moment this is failing everyone\".

However, he added that the Brexit negotiations would take into account special factors such as the border, the single electricity market and cross-border health care. On the question of whether or not he was likely to be in charge of Northern Ireland via a return to direct rule by the summer, the secretary of state insisted that he was \"not contemplating anything other than a continuation of devolved government in Northern Ireland\". \"I'm very clear this is my absolute focus here,\" he said.", "question": "The Northern Ireland Secretary has rejected calls for him to step @placeholder as chair of cross - party talks after the assembly election .", "option_0": "known", "option_1": "choices", "option_2": "accusing", "option_3": "resigning", "option_4": "aside", "label": 4}

Ten Protestant men were shot dead by the IRA in the attack in County Armagh in 1976. They were shot after gunmen stopped their bus on their way home from work. The inquest heard on Wednesday about a list of names of those involved in the attack, supplied by a self-confessed IRA man in December 1976. Among those named on the list was a man given the cypher \"s104\". He had  \"usually travelled\" on the minibus with the other workmen said a barrister for the families of the victims. This could mean that he was involved in setting up his workmates for slaughter, he added. The list of names was put to the detective who led the investigation following the murders. Det Ch Insp James Mitchell said he could not confirm whether or not he had seen it before, but he identified all of those named as members of the Provisional IRA. He added that most, if not all of them, would have been living in the Republic of Ireland and so would have been beyond the reach of the RUC as on the whole the government in the Republic of Ireland were not co-operating when it came to extradition. The former senior officer was asked about his resourcing, given that it has been reported that 1,000 officers are involved in the recent Manchester suicide attack investigation. He said the manpower available to him was totally inadequate with nine additional detectives sent from Belfast for only a period of weeks. Last Friday Det Ch Insp Mitchell apologised to the victims' families for not getting the satisfaction they had hoped for. He said the \"workload at the time\" and \"depleted resources\" led to weaknesses in the investigation. In 2011, a review of the case was carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET).

{"article": "Hydraulic fracturing, or 'fracking', is a technique used to get a type of gas found deep underground in shale rock. Shale gas is trapped inside tiny pockets of rock - which makes it hard to reach. But recent developments in technology have now made it possible to capture shale gas. Fracking works by drilling straight down and turning the drill horizontally for miles underground. The aim is to reach the tiny pockets or cracks in the shale rock where gas molecules are locked away. Water is pumped down to widen these pockets, and the gas is then released and brought up to the surface. The way the UK currently generates energy can't carry on forever, so new methods are needed. Energy companies say fracking would help give the UK a major source of fuel for the future. Currently most of our gas is imported from other countries - and that is expensive. Fracking in the US and Canada has resulted in finding enough gas to last about 100 years. It's thought that generating electricity from shale gas produces about half the carbon dioxide emissions compared to coal power. Some people are worried about fracking because they think it's too dangerous. Water companies have warned that drinking water could be contaminated with methane gas and chemicals. Fracking uses huge amounts of water that must be transported to the fracking site, which has an environmental impact. There is also the concern that fracking can trigger minor earthquakes. It's thought two small earthquakes of 1.5 and 2.2 magnitude in the Blackpool area in 2011 were caused by fracking - but this hasn't been proven. Campaigners think money should be invested in renewable sources of energy, such as wind power. The government has given fracking its backing. A review done by experts for the government in June 2012 found that the risks from fracking could be managed as long as it was done properly.

{"article": "The subject, Mr Trump said, was \"adoption\". If that seems a strange topic for a post-meal chat it helps to understand that, when it comes to US-Russia relations, a conversation about adoption isn't really about adoption. It's about sanctions. In particular it's about the restrictions placed on high-level Russian officials by the Magnitsky Act, a law passed by the US Congress in 2012 after Russian lawyer and government critic Sergei Magnitsky died under questionable circumstances while being held in a Russian prison in 2009. The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, as it's formally known, has been a burr under Mr Putin's proverbial saddle ever since it hit the books. It imposed visa restrictions and froze the US assets of 18 senior Russian officials deemed by the US government to have committed human rights abuses. At the time Mr Putin called the law a \"purely political, unfriendly move\" and an improper intrusion on to a Russian domestic issue. He - and other state officials - have been working diligently to have it repealed ever since. The adoption issue comes into play because, in retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, Russia suspended a programme that allowed Americans to adopt Russian orphaned children. The Russians called their measure the Dima Yakovlev law, so-named because of a Russian adoptee who died of heat exposure after being left in a car by his American father. When Mr Trump and Mr Putin had their until-recently undisclosed conversation in front of 18 other world leaders and their spouses, with only a Russian translator privy to what was said, they could very well have been discussing what it would take for both the Yakovlev and the Magnitsky laws to go away. It wouldn't be the first time a Trump and a Russian advocate discussed the subject either, as the president himself helpfully pointed out to the New York Times. \"And I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don [Jr, Mr Trump's son] had in that meeting,\" the president told the Times reporters. \"That meeting,\" in this case, was the highly controversial June 2016 sit-down in which Trump Jr, presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chair Paul Manafort met with a delegation of Russian lawyers and lobbyists who count repealing the Magnitsky Law as one of their top priorities. The meeting was set up by Trump Jr associate Rob Goldstone, who billed it as an opportunity for the Trump campaign to receive damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton as part of an official Russian government effort to help Donald Trump be elected president. Yeah, that meeting. Trump Jr originally said the meeting was mostly to talk about adoption.

{"article": "Although the vast tropical area is now divided into regions, scientists suggest these areas did not evolve in isolation from one another. Modern fragmentation could be damaging the process that made the Amazon so important for plant biodiversity. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Writing in their paper, the authors said that while some of the estimated 16,000 tree species were spread throughout the Amazon, others were confined to particular areas. They said that this had provided the basis for the vast seven million square-kilometre habitat to be divided into \"floristic regions\". However, they observed: \"The pattern of diverse local Amazonian tree communities assembled from a species pool composed of mostly regionally restricted species raises the question of how the regional communities are assembled over time.\" In an attempt to answer this puzzle, the team studied the evolutionary history of four dominant groups of trees by analysing DNA, focusing their efforts of the genus Inga - a member of the legume (pea and bean) family. They found that a reason for the high levels of diversity was that the dispersal of the trees could have originated in any part of the whole Amazon basin. \"The history of the rainforest of the Amazon Basin has long intrigued scientists,\" explained co-author Kyle Dexter from the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE). \"Our study used a phylogenetic, evolutionary approach to show the basin has essentially acted as a sloshing bowl of green soup, with tree lineages dispersing back and forth across the basin repeatedly, throughout the last Glacial Maximum and deeper into time.\" Although the paper was an academic study on how one of world's most important biodiversity hotspots was created, it's findings could have an impact on the way people considered conserving the rainforest for future generations. \"We could be concerned about the implication of a recommendation that we did not have to worry about cutting down a corner of the Amazon basin because we have got a high phylogenetic diversity of trees elsewhere,\" said fellow co-author Toby Pennington, also from RBGE and the University of Edinburgh. \"But we need to repeat the study, for example, for plants that have less dispersal capabilities.\" Dr Pennington added that the dispersal patterns displayed by the trees in the Amazon were not repeated by other organisms. \"For example, birds seem to show much more geographically restricted patterns,\" he told BBC News. \"It's a complicated picture with different organisms with different biology doing different things.\" Follow Mark on Twitter.", "question": "The rich diversity of trees in the Amazon could be the result of @placeholder dispersal over geological time , a study has suggested .", "option_0": "major", "option_1": "overall", "option_2": "widespread", "option_3": "generating", "option_4": "bureaucratic", "label": 2}

Mr Javid has launched a consultation to consider the financial situation of Tata's UK pension scheme. He said the government was considering the proposals at the request of the trustees of the pension scheme and that any changes would need the approval of the regulator. He stressed that several options were being considered. \"No decision has been made. We are wary of setting a precedent,\" he said. \"This is very much about this scheme and this scheme only, in very unique circumstances.\" How steel workers' pensions could be hit One option under discussion is to base the scheme's annual increase on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure, which is usually below the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure currently used. This is the path favoured by the British Steel Pensions Scheme as they say it would leave most of the pension holders either better off or no worse off, compared with entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is the likely alternative. The PPF is a pensions lifeboat, funded by companies, designed to protect pensioners if their scheme were to go under. However, steel workers would be worse off under it. The company and the steel trade unions also welcomed the consultation, with the union saying that entering the PPF would be an \"unmitigated disaster\". \"We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities,\" the union added in a statement.

Oil-rich Venezuela has been hit hard by the global drop in oil prices and suffers from high inflation and a chronic shortage of basic goods. Several airline companies have said that currency controls in Venezuela made it impossible for airlines to convert their earnings into dollars and send the money abroad. In a statement, Latam airlines said it would suspend its operations to Caracas airport \"temporarily and for an unspecified time\". It said flights on its Sao Paulo to Caracas route would end first, within days, and the other routes it runs to Caracas from Lima and Santiago would be halted by the end of July. Strict currency controls were first imposed in Venezuela in 2003 by late President Hugo Chavez. The restrictions were further tightened two years ago, forcing several airlines to reduce their operations in the country as they struggled to repatriate billions of dollars in revenue held in the local currency - the bolivar. Some airlines are now requiring passengers to pay their fares in dollars. Venezuela's government says it is using its foreign reserves - which are now scarce - to pay for essential items such as medicines and industrial machinery.

I can't make any judgement here that's going to be beneficial, short or long-term, in a business context. \"The community may have spoken but the business community is still the wealth creating vehicle and we have got to find a way through this.\" Cornwall businesswoman Melanie Evans said she was \"absolutely delighted\" at the result. \"The EU money has been spent unwisely in places on projects that have gone bankrupt and we now have the opportunity to take control of that funding,\" she said. \"We are in a deprived status and we have remained in deprived status even though that funding was coming in so it shows it hasn't worked.\" The people of Cornwall have voted to leave the EU - proof perhaps that money can't buy love. While Britain as a whole has paid to be part of the EU, Cornwall is in the unusual position of being a net beneficiary. Despite the huge investment in projects like the Combined Universities in Penryn, the Eden Project and Cornwall Airport Newquay, along with Superfast broadband - many people simply do not think they have felt any benefit. And some say the fact that Cornwall still qualifies for this extra funding is an indication it hasn't sparked the growth intended. Remain campaigners have warned Cornwall has always fared badly from Westminster and are not confident of future support of the scale seen from the EU. But with five out of six Cornish MP's backing Leave during this campaign perhaps this vote here isn't surprising. Eric Nicholls, Chairman of Cornwall Manufacturers' Group, said: \"Whether Cornwall will continue to receive its EU funding is far from certain, as are the pledges from the Remain side that this would be met from central government.\" Sarah Newton, Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth, who voted Remain, said she wanted to \"make sure the money gets into Cornwall so we can carry on making progress in getting well-paid jobs\". Cllr Tim Dwelly, leader of the Labour Group at Cornwall Council, said: \"This is a disaster for Cornwall. Years of special EU funding for Cornwall are going to end. \"That funding has given us fibre broadband, a university, superb sixth form colleges, dual carriageways, airport investment, rail improvement, support for farmers and all kinds of business.\" Chris Pomfret, former Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership chairman, and now chairman of governors at Falmouth University said: \"I'm worried there will be turmoil that could go on for years.\" William Arnold tweeted: \"It's Ok though we can carry on being serfs in a theme park for second home owners and their children.\" A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \"It is important to understand that there will be no immediate changes. \"We must now prepare for a negotiation to exit the EU that will ensure the interests of all parts of the United Kingdom are protected and advanced.\"", "question": "The government must replace the millions of pounds of EU support Cornwall may @placeholder from Brexit with investment , its council leader says .", "option_0": "lose", "option_1": "emerges", "option_2": "differs", "option_3": "prevented", "option_4": "suffer", "label": 0}

Some of the remarks may border on hate speech, defamation and contempt of court, three legal groups said. Protection for Ms Masipa has been stepped up since the verdict, South Africa's City Press newspaper reports. Police officers from the Tactical Response Team have been stationed outside her home and have also been escorting her, the paper said. Ms Masipa became a judge in 1998 - the second black woman in the country's history to reach that position. The Olympic athlete denied murdering Reeva Steenkamp after a row on Valentine's Day last year, saying he shot her by mistake believing there was an intruder in the house. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says some legal experts were surprised by last Friday's verdict, but there have been more personal criticisms of Judge Masipa on social media. It is the personal nature of these attacks that are of concern to the three legal groups, Legal Resources Centre, Section27 and the Centre for Child Law. \"Whilst it is understandable that people may disagree with the verdict, there is a significant difference between criticising the judgment and criticising the judge,\" their statement said. \"These comments allege that Judge Masipa is corrupt, and/or that her gender and/or race rendered her incompetent in appropriately applying the law to the evidence presented.\" The statement said that her decision in the high-profile case last week required a considered application of the law in relation to the evidence presented. \"Attacking and threatening Judge Masipa because she is black or because she is female is simply unacceptable and should not be tolerated in our current constitutional framework, where equality and non-discrimination are of paramount importance,\" the groups said.

{"article": "The former Portuguese colony, a near neighbour of Hong Kong, occupies a small peninsula and two islands off China's southern coast. Its economy revolves around tourism. Macau has capitalised on its long history as a gambling centre, drawing many thousands of visitors from China and Hong Kong. Foreign casino companies have invested heavily since Hong Kong tycoon Stanley Ho's decades-long monopoly on the gaming industry ended in 2002. New \"mega-casinos\", which include major hotel developments, have replaced traditional gambling dens. Macau profile - home Read more country profiles Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring In 2006 the returns from the casino boom surpassed the revenues of the US gambling mecca, Las Vegas. But analysts warn that Macau risks relying too much on the industry. In 2014, Macau's annual revenue dipped for the first time since its casinos were liberalised 12 years earlier. The development was attributed in part to the mainland's anti-corruption drive. Chief Executive Dr Fernando Chui has since pledged to diversify the local economy in an apparent response to demands from Beijing. The former colony reverted to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 after 400 years of Portuguese rule. Beijing promised to uphold Western-style freedoms for at least 50 years. Although it is part of China, Macau is governed under the \"one country, two systems\" principle, under which it has a large degree of autonomy. Pro-reform forces are less vocal in Macau than in Hong Kong. A new state security law came into effect in 2009 with very little opposition, whereas attempts by the Chinese government to introduce a similar law in Hong Kong in 2003 triggered mass protests. In 2014, activists organised an unofficial poll calling for more democracy, but the vote was disrupted by the security forces and only 9,000 people took part, with 89% voting for universal suffrage by 2019. Portuguese seafarers settled in the area in the 1500s. Initially, the colony prospered on the lucrative returns from regional trade, and European-style mansions and churches mushroomed.

{"article": "The government has been reviewing what powers schools and councils should have. It has also been looking at what planned new regional boards should do. Education Secretary John Swinney will set out the proposals to the Scottish Parliament. Councils are fiercely protective of their role in the education system. Virtually every state-funded school in Scotland is run by the local council. Watch live coverage of the ministerial statement on education governance here from 2.45pm. The government has already set out in broad terms what may and may not be on its agenda and carried out a major consultation with stakeholders. It says it wants to empower parents and give as much power as possible to head teachers. But it has also made it clear that schools will not be able to opt out of local authority control and that there will be no selective schools or grammar schools. The questions are more about exactly what formal powers heads should have, how parents will be involved, what responsibilities councils should retain and what the role of the proposed new regional boards which will operate across council areas should be. In a newspaper article this week, Mr Swinney wrote: \"We firstly must ask: who is best placed to understand and meet the educational needs of individual children? Who knows them? Who is at the heart of their schooling? \"That is why I have pledged to make teachers and parents the key decision makers in the life of a school. Decisions about a child's learning should be made as close to that child as possible.\" The Scottish government has said it wants to be judged on education. It has highlighted how it wants to close the gap between how well children from relatively rich and poor backgrounds perform and raise attainment across the board. But doing this is easier said than done. Last year, Scotland recorded its worst performance in the international Pisa rankings, classed as average in all three areas for the first time ever. The Scottish government's own surveys on literacy and numeracy suggest performance has been declining. The government accepts that these issues need to be addressed, but also points to exam results and the high proportion of youngsters in work, education or training as positives and insists that Scotland has a fundamentally good education system. It is likely to stress today that any structural reform is not an end in itself - rather it is a means of helping head teachers to raise attainment. The government's critics point out that after 10 years in charge, it can be held to account for problems and what they see as a lack of progress. The plans to be announced follow on from other government steps. They include: However, critics note the decline in the number of teachers in recent years, the significant recruitment problems in some areas and the pressure on council budgets. The education secretary is likely to face a tough balancing act - his plans could be condemned by some as too radical and by others as too tame. The largest teachers' union, the EIS, said in its response to the government's review that the main challenges facing schools were related to funding, resources and staffing. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: \"Improving learning in our classrooms can be achieved by providing greater support to teachers through improved resourcing, effective pedagogical leadership and advice, and creating time to teach. \"None of these require organisational change,  but all of them require a change in culture from government, both local and national, with greater trust being placed in the profession.\" Scotland's 32 councils play a pivotal role in education - they run schools, employ teachers and set budgets - although they work within a number of national agreements. Local government organisation Cosla argues that closing the attainment gap requires a holistic approach involving different public services and agencies - not a simple focus on classroom-based education. It believes there is no evidence that governance structures are a barrier to dealing with the attainment gap or improving the delivery of education. Indeed a number of education experts would make the point that changing governance arrangements would not, in itself, raise performance. Although the SNP enjoys a strong position in local government after May's council elections, other parties are likely to look for any signs of the reforms undermining the role of councils. Those who might want more fundamental change are likely to be disappointed too. State-funded schools operating outside the traditional system - like Jordanhill in Glasgow - are likely to remain the exception. There will be no provision for schools to opt out of council control although one source close to government suggested to BBC Scotland that a question would be \"what actual council control they would be opting out of\" once the powers being given to heads are clear. The announcement will be awaited keenly by parents, teachers, unions and councils. But ultimately the question will be whether these reforms play a part in raising attainment.", "question": "Plans for a major shake - up in the way schools are @placeholder will be set out by the Scottish government later .", "option_0": "coping", "option_1": "predicting", "option_2": "hopeful", "option_3": "governed", "option_4": "emerging", "label": 3}

Col Denise Lind ruled against a defence argument that the government had not properly alleged that Pte Manning intended to help al-Qaeda.

In arguing the case for keeping the charge in place, prosecutors said Pte Manning knew the information would be seen by al-Qaeda, regardless of whether that was his main intention. Col Lind eventually ruled that the charge must be proven during the court martial. If prosecutors fail to prove Pte Manning knew he was giving information to the enemy, Col Lind said she would consider further motions from the defence. While the court martial date has been set, Pte Manning has not yet entered a plea, or decided whether he will be tried by a judge or a jury. During pre-trial hearings, Col Lind also heard arguments about whether or not the leaked material actually harmed US interests - and whether this mattered. Defence lawyer David Coombs said he believed the reports would show the leaks did little harm. If Wikileaks had created significant harm to the US, the prosecution would be eager to discuss them, Mr Coombs said. Prosecutor Maj Ashden Fein called the reports \"completely irrelevant\", arguing the government did not have to prove if damages actually occurred, only that Pte Manning knew they could. Pte Manning is alleged to have been the source of a series of high-profile security breaches that saw Wikileaks rise to global fame.

Rupert Onslow said the Â£65m restoration cost would be best spent on at risk National Trust (NT) properties. The NT said it was exploring \"various options\" for the Grade-I listed house, but it did have a future. The Palladian mansion, near Guildford, was bequeathed to the NT in 1956. Lord Onslow told BBC Surrey it should be allowed to go to ruin. \"The tragedy is that the house has gone. It's happened, Clandon has been lost,\" he said. \"My question, which I think is best answered by the members, is what would they wish to have done with the insurance money? \"Do the [NT] members want to see what would be a suburban mock-Georgian monolith sitting on a small garden? \"Or would they like to see restoration of a building of historic genuine nature that is in danger of collapsing?\" He added: \"I will never forget seeing orange fire in 44 windows on four floors of that house. \"It's not because I didn't love Clandon it's just that I don't think the [NT] members would genuinely benefit from a replica. \"I think it should be shorn up and left as a tragic sad site.

{"article": "The taskforce was appointed by the Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland. It was asked to examine the impact of negative equity and repossessions. The taskforce has warned that the number of people falling behind on their mortgage payments could increase as interest rates begin to rise. The taskforce is now undertaking further work aimed at developing policy recommendations. Northern Ireland suffered a huge housing bubble followed by a crash that saw prices fall by almost 50%. As a consequence, rates of negative equity are much worse than elsewhere in the UK and repossessions have also increased. A major \"at risk\" group identified by the taskforce are households who undertook \"equity release\" remortgages at the height of the market. They are people who increased their mortgages to release cash for other purposes, such as home improvements or to finance buy-to-let properties. In 2007, 74% of remortgaging in Northern Ireland was for equity release. The taskforce said this category of \"credit hungry\" borrower was disproportionately active in Northern Ireland. Lower income groups who took out \"second charge\" mortgages with subprime lenders are also at high-risk. The taskforce said those lenders have shown \"a more tenacious approach to arrears management\". However, it said, in general, lenders have shown \"forbearance\" and if they had not done so rates of repossessions would be higher. The taskforce warned that, despite a gradual recovery in the Northern Ireland economy and the housing market, major risks remain. It said that the Northern Ireland economy \"remains some distance from reaching escape velocity\"' and that borrowers are \"poorly equipped to absorb future income shocks\".", "question": "The Northern Ireland housing market remains \" @placeholder \" and poses a risk to economic recovery , a Stormont - backed taskforce has concluded .", "option_0": "unacceptable", "option_1": "unfair", "option_2": "dysfunctional", "option_3": "disappointing", "option_4": "priority", "label": 2}

But the talks broke down when one of the clerics was arrested in Jordan for promoting jihadist views, he said. The FBI has confirmed to the BBC that it was aware of the discussions, but refused to elaborate. New York lawyer Stanley Cohen said he was asked to help by a US veteran and Palestinian activists who knew Mr Kassig. He was known as Peter before he converted to Islam while in captivity.

But he was arrested by the Jordanian government for using the internet to promote jihadist views, and the talks subsequently broke down. The other cleric was reportedly Abu Qatada, who was released from prison in Jordan in September after being found not guilty of terrorism offences by a court in Amman. He confirmed in an interview with the Guardian newspaper that he had he worked with Abu Mohammed al-Maqdisi to help save Mr Kassig. Mr Cohen said negotiations with Islamic State, formerly known as Isis, had been \"sandbagged by the Jordanian government\". \"The bottom line is this: it wasn't Isis that broke the agreement although Isis did, in fact, kill Kassig,\" Mr Cohen told the BBC's Newsday programme. \"The agreement was broken by Jordan and the US did nothing to undo it.

{"article": "The choice has been well-received by both analysts and politicians - even some, like Senator John McCain, who have been critical of many of President Trump's decisions. But who is Herbert Raymond McMaster? Lieutenant General HR McMaster is a decorated military official, having served in command positions during the Gulf War in the early 1990s and with the Central Command during the Iraq war in the early 2000s. He was awarded the silver star for valour for his actions. In Afghanistan, he headed an anti-corruption and transparency task force. But he is also known for his academic interest in history - and applying that intellectual approach to the battlefield. Lt Gen McMaster graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1984, but went on to become something of a scholar of military history. He earned in MA in history from the University of North Carolina in 1994, and taught history at the military academy for two years, before being awarded a PhD in American history in 1996. That same year, he published a popular military history of the Vietnam War, \"Dereliction of Duty\", which was deeply critical of the decision-making process in Washington during the era. The New York Times review of the book credited Lt Gen McMaster as having \"doggedly waded through the records of every meeting of the Joint Chiefs\" and noted that he concluded that the war was ''lost in Washington . . . even before the first American units were deployed\". That academic mindset and intellectual approach to military command impressed many people during this time in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is widely labelled as a deep military thinker: Time magazine said that he \"might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker\". In 2005, he led an operation at Tal Afar in Iraq which was widely held as an example of success in a difficult war. He seized the town, cutting it off from outside fighters - and then slowly but surely worked his way through the city districts, leaving troop outposts in place - and not allowing the enemy to return, in stark contrast to earlier US strategy. Lt Gen McMaster's approach was lauded by President George W Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Writing at the time for the Daily Telegraph, Tim Collins, a former SAS officer and journalist, said Lt Gen McMaster - then a colonel - had taken \"a refreshingly unconventional approach\". \"By using academics and Middle East experts as advisers, he sought to educate his men about the intricacies of Tal Afar. Successfully, it would seem, for his forces won over at least some of the disillusioned Turkmen population at the same time as isolating the relatively small cadre of die-hard extremists,\" he wrote in September 2005. Yet despite attempts to replicate the strategy, Lt Gen McMaster himself told the New Yorker magazine the following year that constant fresh consideration was the key. \"It is so damn complex. If you ever think you have the solution to this, you're wrong, and you're dangerous. You have to keep listening and thinking and being critical and self-critical,\" he said. He also spoke about some of the tragedies he witnessed during the operation in a 2007 interview with the Sunday Times, in which he spoke of the \"child abuse\" of al-Qaeda training young men, through often brutal means. \"I saw the most unimaginable horrors,\" he said. \"Things you can't even imagine another human thinking of. In one case, the terrorists murdered a young boy in his hospital bed, booby-trapped the body, and when the family came to pick up the body they detonated the explosives to kill the father.\" Sir Max Hastings, writing in the Guardian in 2007, called Lt Gen McMaster \"the most successful unit commander to have served in Iraq\" and Pulitzer Prize winner Thomas Ricks noted that his \"influence already outstrips [his] rank\". He was pulled back to Baghdad in 2007 to be part of the informally-titled \"Baghdad brains trust\" - along with several other military academics - tasked with coming up with a fresh approach. In the year since, he has applied his famous deep-thinking approach to his work at the Army Capabilities Integration Centre, which he began in 2008. He also served as the commander of the Army's Manoeuvre Centre of Excellence. During this period, he was promoted up the chain of command for his contributions to his current rank, a three-star lieutenant general - the second-highest rank ordinarily achievable.", "question": "Donald Trump 's new national security advisor has been @placeholder in the shadow of a controversy after his predecessor lasted just three weeks in the job .", "option_0": "rediscovered", "option_1": "declared", "option_2": "dismissed", "option_3": "condemned", "option_4": "appointed", "label": 4}

The fast-moving worm is currently outpacing malicious equivalents seeking the same vulnerable gear. Security researchers say they do not know who created Hajime or how it might ultimately be used. Hajime was first discovered in October 2016 and, said security researchers, had been hunting down IoT devices with security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a different worm, called Mirai. Earlier the same month, a network of devices compromised by Mirai was responsible for knocking offline high-profile websites including Twitter, Spotify and Reddit. Modest estimates suggested Hajime was now present on \"tens of thousands\" of devices, wrote Symantec researcher Waylon Grange in a blog. Programs such as Hajime and Mirai must keep scouring the net for victims, because switching off a vulnerable device generally cleans out the infection. Mr Grange noted that Hajime currently had no attack code built in so could not be used to mount the kinds of attacks Mirai had been implicated in. The only action taken by Hajime is to regularly display a message from the worm's author on the internal interface for each device. The message says, among other things: \"Just a white hat, securing some systems.\" The term \"white hat\" is typically applied to those hackers seeking to secure rather than exploit vulnerabilities. Malicious or criminal hackers are known as \"black hats\". \"There is a question around trusting that the author is a true white hat and is only trying to secure these systems, as they are still installing their own backdoor on the system,\" wrote Mr Grange.

Beijing and Shanghai both failed the assessment, which was based on measurements of major pollutants. China is attempting to cut pollution but the country still relies heavily on coal for its energy needs. The government shut more than 8,000 coal-burning factories in Hebei last year. But the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing says like many places in China, the authorities are struggling to balance factory closures with the demands of the country's slowing economy. The environment ministry's statement published on its website  (in Chinese) noted that the 2014 result was an improvement over the previous year, where only three cities met the standards. But it added that \"presently, the country's air pollution situation remains serious\". The assessment was based on readings of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone. The southern city of Haikou, in Hainan province, was found to have the cleanest air. Most of the eight cities that made the grade were in the east of the country. Meanwhile the northern industrial city of Baoding had the dirtiest air. The statement did not give the rankings for Beijing and Shanghai, although it noted that Beijing's air quality had improved slightly over the previous year. The Chinese authorities announced a \"war on air pollution\" last year, and recently began publishing figures for the air quality in China's cities. Officials have pledged to restrict consumption of coal, scrap millions of cars and rely more on clean energy sources. At November's Apec summit, China made a historic pledge that its carbon emissions would peak by 2030, but did not set a specific target. It also attempted to improve the air quality in Beijing during the Apec summit, imposing tight limits on car use and ordering factories to close in the weeks leading up to the meeting.

The Red Forest (2012) uses infrared film to document the condition of the most radioactive forest in the world and in turn reimagines Ukraine in deep Soviet burgundy,\" says Thompson. Thompson's other pictures reflect previous uses for the Kodak film, from the medical application seen in the picture In The Vein (2014) to its deployment by the military in aerial surveillance. The film was used to photograph military paintings, Thompson says, \"simultaneously manipulating the film's historical military application of uncovering camouflage and also revealing hidden charcoal underdrawing\". Like photographer Richard Mosse, who also worked with Aerochrome, Thompson is clear that despite the otherworldly look, these pictures are as real any documentary image. He said: \"There is much debate in contemporary photojournalism and documentary photography about manipulations, both in the construction and post-production of photographic imagery. \"Although the infrared photographs in The Unseen look strangely sensational, they are not constructed or manipulated.

In its report, Ofsted said the county's most vulnerable children were not being protected or given appropriate help when needed. It said key areas of social work had \"fundamental weaknesses\" and it took the authority too long for social workers to see children most at risk. The watchdog blamed some problems on the recent re-organisation of the department and its focus on putting new systems in place, which in turn failed to spot whether the basic requirements of social work practice were being met. Ofsted added that poor leadership, social worker supervision and record-keeping had contributed to the authority's low grading. It said \"immediate action\" must take place to ensure vulnerable children and their families have adequate access to support, with the roles of the authority's leadership also needing to be clearly established.

{"article": "The Ministry of Defence revealed the name, to coincide with Trafalgar Day, for the first vessel of the £31bn project to replace existing submarines. The MoD said nine Navy vessels had previously been named Dreadnought. Perhaps the most famous was HMS Dreadnought, commissioned in 1906, which transformed naval warfare. The name became used at the time to describe a new era of warship design. Other Dreadnoughts included one that sailed with Sir Francis Drake to battle the Spanish Armada in 1588, and another that was present with Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Britain's first nuclear-powered submarine, launched 56 years ago, also shared the name. Critics of the project to renew the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system believe the enormous investment could be better spent elsewhere. But Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: \"Every day our ballistic missile submarines are used to deter the most extreme threats to Britain's security. \"We cannot know what dangers we might face in the 2030s, 2040s and 2050s, so we are building the new Dreadnought class. \"Along with increasing the defence budget to buy new ships, more planes, and armoured vehicles, this commitment shows we will never gamble with our security.\" Dreadnought will be the lead boat of the four new submarines, as well as the class name for the whole fleet. The MoD, which received approval for the name from the Queen, said the next three boats would also be given names with \"historical resonance\". But there are still groups fighting against the project who have said the bill will run much higher than predicted. Dave Webb, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: \"Replacing and running Trident is set to cost a staggering £205bn. \"The government dishonestly states Trident will cost between £31bn and £41bn, but that's only the cost of manufacturing four submarines. \"Hundreds of billions for a nuclear weapons system that does nothing to address the real and serious security threats we face - like terrorism and cyberwarfare - but not enough money for schools, hospitals, welfare and jobs.

He subjected his victim, a disabled woman, to sexual assaults while holding her as a virtual prisoner. His 54-year-old wife Caroline received a three-year sentence, 18 months of which will be spent in jail. Prosecutors are considering appealing against the sentences the Bakers received. Police rescued the victim from the house in Craigavon, County Armagh, in 2012. She had been reported missing to Suffolk Police by her husband eight years earlier. The force confirmed she was reported as missing by her husband on 15 March 2004. \"On 16 March 2004, police took a call from a woman who said her husband had reported her as missing. \"She told officers she was not missing, but was on holiday with a friend. \"Police updated her husband to this effect and, as a result, enquiries were concluded.\" Asked by BBC Radio Ulster whether it was usual for a missing person search to be given up after one phone call was received, Tim Passmore, Police and Crime Commissioner for Suffolk, said: \"In today's situation, it certainly wouldn't be. \"I would be seriously alarmed if that happened today.\" Ask those who knew Baker and knew the family set-up - described in court as \"grossly unconventional\" - and one word keeps cropping up: \"Control\".

I was terrified of him, really terrified. People kept telling me to leave him, but I said: 'I can't because he'll find me.'\" Another woman who knew the family tells a similar tale.

A Public Prosecution Service (PPS) spokesman said: \"The Public Prosecution Service is currently considering if there is a basis to refer the sentences handed down in this case to the Court of Appeal on the grounds that they may be unduly lenient. \"An unduly lenient sentence is one that falls outside the range of sentence that a judge, taking into consideration all relevant factors and having regard to sentencing guidance, could reasonably consider appropriate.\"", "question": "Police were told that the victim of rapist Keith Baker was not missing , but \" on holiday with a friend \" , it has @placeholder .", "option_0": "suggested", "option_1": "emerged", "option_2": "admitted", "option_3": "confirmed", "option_4": "resigned", "label": 1}

Mr McDonald will also chair a national child protection action group. Opposition parties broadly welcomed the plans, while raising questions about specific issues. The announcement follows the findings of an independent review of the child protection system, led by former Crown Office chief Catherine Dyer, and the government's child protection improvement programme report. Ms Dyer's report concluded that the child protection system \"works well\" for young people identified as being at risk, and is \"capable of delivering the support needed\". However, it noted the \"complex and sensitive\" issues dealt with and the \"new risks emerging\". It recommended the establishment of a national child protection leadership group, the development of a national child protection register, and a set of national standards for those undertaking significant case reviews. In a statement to MSPs, Mr McDonald said all 12 recommendations from the report would be taken forward. The new criminal offence would be an amendment to the Children and Young Persons (Scotland) Act 1937, the \"archaic\" wording of which Mr McDonald said was making it difficult to prosecute abusers. He told members: \"Catherine Dyer's review concludes that, in general, our child protection system works well. However, both she and the Child Protection Improvement Programme Report have identified opportunities to strengthen all aspects of the system to better protect our children. \"I have made clear where I expect to see improvements in Scotland's child protection system, particularly in relation to consistency of approach. \"If in a year's time there is little evidence of real and substantial progress then I will not hesitate to bring forward legislation to provide an appropriate statutory underpinning.\" During the subsequent questions, Scottish Conservative Miles Briggs raised the \"worrying trend\" of human trafficking, asking if there would be specific measures to tackle this.

The court upheld the law itself, but ruled that it could not be applied in cases where protests did not constitute a threat. Last November, Mr Dadin said he had been tortured in prison. Now, his lawyer says he expects the case against the activist to be overturned when it is reviewed by the Supreme Court. Mr Dadin's wife, Anastasia Zotova, was in court and told the BBC the court's decision was \"a bit better\" than she had expected. \"It's very good that the court decided the case must be reviewed and probably overturned,\" she said. \"It seems Ildar won't have to stay in prison for [the remaining 172 days of his sentence], that he will be out before then. \"We are all very happy about that and we are waiting for him. \"However, it is bad that the court did not overturn Article 212.1, which means that those people who keep staging pickets can still be prosecuted under that law.\" What is Article 212.1? Protesting in Putin's Russia Ildar Dadin has become a symbol of Russia's growing intolerance of dissent. The laws regulating protests were tightened after a wave of mass street rallies in Moscow in 2011 and 2012 that worried the Kremlin. Since then, the new rules have seen even lone, silent picketers detained by police and fined. In 2014 the authorities went further. Article 212.1 made repeat violations of the strict new laws a criminal offence, punishable by up to five years behind bars. But the constitutional court now says that repeat offenders should not get a prison sentence if there is no threat to the public or to public property. That qualification will be added to the law, but the controversial article itself - Article 212.1 - will remain. This ruling could lead to Mr Dadin's early release. He was transferred to the far east of Russia late last year, after he complained to his wife that he had been beaten and threatened repeatedly by prison guards.

Boss Tim Cook told Uber founder Travis Kalanick to remove the \"fingerprinting\" code or he would  ban the app from the Apple Store, the paper claims. Apple declined to comment. Uber said the practice of fingerprinting deterred criminals from installing its app on stolen phones, using stolen credit cards to book journeys, then wiping the phone and doing it again. \"Being able to recognise known bad actors when they try to get back on to our network is an important security measure for both Uber and our users,\" it said.

The New York Times also claimed Uber ringfenced Apple's Cupertino headquarters so that employees using the app there would not notice. Cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from University of Surrey, said the act of fingerprinting is fairly common and generally not blocked by other operators - for example, if you sign into a service from a different device and get an email warning you about it, it's because there is a device ID linked to your account. \"Digital fingerprinting can be effective in tracking who goes where on the web, and it can be used to prevent fraud, but also it has the potential to invade your privacy,\" he said. \"Whether it should be allowed ultimately will be a matter for the legislators and not all jurisdictions will necessarily agree.\" The practice is still banned by Apple.", "question": "Uber reportedly used a @placeholder called fingerprinting to track iPhones in order to fight fraud - despite Apple banning the practice .", "option_0": "rare", "option_1": "decision", "option_2": "popular", "option_3": "controversial", "option_4": "tactic", "label": 4}

Tomorrow is also the 750th anniversary of the de Montfort parliament convoked by Simon de Montfort, the first nobleman to seize power and govern the country. It is seen as the first English parliament as it was the first with a house of commons to which knights from the counties and burgesses from the towns were summoned. Historian Professor David Carpenter notes that de Montfort may have opposed King Henry III under the umbrella of \"England for the English\" even though he wasn't English himself. There was also a strong Welsh dimension to his power grab. Prof Carpenter told me: \"One of the bases of Montfort's power was his alliance with Llywelyn who was very soon to be recognised as prince of Wales. In fact Montfort himself, very soon after the parliament, affirmed that alliance with Llywelyn by actually recognising him as just that, recognising him as prince of Wales and that laid the foundation for the later treaty of Montgomery in which King Henry III did the same. \"The result was there was a very, very large contingent on Montfort's side at the final, fatal battle of Evesham and as they marched out of Evesham this Welsh contingent of footsoldiers let out a great shout which shook the heavens. And for many of them it was the last shout of their lives because they were then massacred in the battle in which Montfort himself was also gruesomely killed.\" The BBC is today marking the 750th anniversary of the de Montfort parliament in what we are calling \"Democracy Day\".

IS said she was killed in a Jordanian air strike, but the US blames IS for her death. \"We were told Kayla was tortured, that she was the property of Baghdadi. We were told that in June by the government,\" her parents, Carl and Marsha, told ABC News. Baghdadi personally took the humanitarian aid worker to the home of another senior IS member - Abu Sayyaf - who was in charge of IS oil and gas until his death in a US special forces operation in May, ABC news, citing US officials, reports. The channel said he regularly visited the compound where she was being held and repeatedly assaulted her. Officials said they had obtained information about the abuse from at least two teenage Yazidi girls who were held hostage as sex slaves and found inside the Sayyaf compound at the time of the US attack. Mueller was reportedly held for some time by Sayyaf and his wife, Umm Sayyaf, who was also captured by US special forces in May. At the time, the Pentagon said Umm Sayyaf was suspected of being an IS member and of being complicit in the enslavement of a young Yazidi woman who was rescued in the raid. Hundreds of young women and girls - many of them Yazidis captured in northern Iraq - are believed to be held as sex slaves by IS militants in areas under their control. The Yazidi girls provided intelligence used by the US to interrogate Sayyaf's wife, who \"spilled everything\" about several IS leaders and their whereabouts, a counterterrorism official told ABC. Umm Sayyaf was handed over to the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq last week to face trial.

He's learned, in his words, to cultivate a \"double rhino skin\". \"I've learned a lot in the last nine years under the guidance and tutelage of Warren Gatland. There's a bit of Kiwi in me somewhere. You have to be tough,\" Howley says. \"The hardest part of the role is probably the influence it has on your family, and your children in particular. I try to stay away from social media. I'm not on it. \"Ultimately we like to think that we can make our own more informed decisions with the information that we have.\" The rise of social media has led to a more abrasive, pernicious form of public discourse. From the bunker of a social media account, criticism becomes more stinging, pronouncements more vitriolic and while Howley gives it a wide berth, he's witnessed the effect of its darker side on his charges. \"I'm not going to mention the players' names, but it certainly has affected players who played for Wales over the last four to five years and it's not nice, is it?\" he continues. \"It's very critical and when you see statements in black and white, it hurts.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Human nature dictates that one negative comment will resonate longer and louder than 10 positive ones, but Howley accepts that you have to take the rough with the smooth. \"If you are going to go on Twitter and Facebook when you're playing well, you have to be able to take it when you're not playing well,\" he adds. \"That's a decision and it's about making better decisions by the players because ultimately [social media criticism] has an influence when you don't pay well, particularly in a country like Wales.\" That is the crux of it. Gareth Edwards once marvelled at the fact David Duckham, an England contemporary during Wales' 1970s golden era, could walk down an English high street unrecognised - a rugby superstar, but a relative stranger in his own land. Welsh players have never had that luxury. A winning try can turn you into a national hero. A missed tackle can turn you into a pariah. And in a culture where mobile phones are ubiquitous, where lives are lived through our screens, confidence can be shattered, and careers destroyed. Media playback is not supported on this device Modern rugby is no place for sensitive souls - neither on the pitch nor off - but what it does show is that people care. Whether they express themselves politely or not, they are moved to comment because Wales is their team and the team is the embodiment of their national pride. The criticism aimed at Howley's players during the autumn was that they lacked enterprise, urgency and creativity, that they were humbled by Australia and pushed to the verge of humiliation by Japan. Victories over Argentina and a neutered Springbok side offered scant consolation to a rugby public with soaring expectations. While Howley accepts that Wales have some distance to travel to match the level of performance produced by England and Ireland during the same period, he maintains that winning ugly still trumps losing valiantly. \"I can see that and I can also see the other side of the coin where we've come up short and we've lost those games and then we've been criticised for not winning those games. So sometimes you're damned if you do and damned if you don't,\" he says. The Six Nations, he argues, is a different tournament with a different set of pressures, and the fact that people are already talking about Ireland v England as a Grand Slam decider does not bother him in the slightest. \"We'll come in under the radar and back ourselves. We've got a captain who backs himself and I know all of our players will follow,\" he adds. \"He [Wales skipper Alun Wyn Jones] has high expectations, and the supporters do, as do we as coaches. \"And sometimes there are 15 players trying to stop you, and ultimately, sometimes they do.\" That is sport in a nutshell. No one has a divine right to win. But do not tell Howley and his players they are not trying. Unless you are willing to say it to their face.", "question": "It is often said that if you @placeholder your job , you will never do a day 's work in your life , but if your every action is scrutinised and critiqued by millions , enjoyment can soon turn to misery and misery to paranoia .", "option_0": "offer", "option_1": "overcome", "option_2": "hopes", "option_3": "guarantee", "option_4": "enjoy", "label": 4}

{"article": "Brawn told BBC Sport: \"I have had some discussions with them to see if I can help them have any clarity on what they need to do for the future.\" His remarks come at the end of a difficult week for Honda, in which it has been heavily criticised by McLaren. McLaren executive director Zak Brown said: \"Something needs to change.\" Brown had already said on Wednesday that he had \"serious concerns\" about Honda's ability to succeed in F1 and that the company appeared \"lost\" when it came to solving its problems with performance and reliability. The team have scored no points this season and McLaren cars have finished only four times in 12 races. Honda F1 boss Yusuke Hasegawa said: \"It is very difficult. It is very unfortunate we cannot convince them we can do that. From the results point of view, we demand much improvement. We need to do everything.\" He added: \"It is obviously a frustrating current situation and we are disappointed with our results so it is no wonder there is some complaining comments. \"But the things we can do is try our very best for the team and we are aiming to go in the same direction.\" Brawn added: \"We value Honda as part of the sport and if we can do anything to support their efforts to improve for the future we will do that.\" Asked about Brawn's comments, Hasegawa said: \"I appreciate his comments and I will ask him if we need his support.\" There is growing speculation that McLaren and Honda are nearing the point where their partnership will become untenable. The pair have a long-term contract but Brown has shifted from McLaren's previous position of being \"100% committed\" to the partnership. He said in an interview with BBC Sport on Friday at the Canadian Grand Prix: \"The plan right now is to have the Honda in the back of the car (in 2018) but some things need to happen between now and then for us to have the confidence we can be at the front of the field next year. \"We need to get competitive and show regular signs that we are getting competitive. \"Right now, we're not racing well, not finishing races and that can't happen any more. \"We are starting to work on the 2018 car so we need to make any decisions that impact 2018 by the summer break. Something needs to change. If you keep doing the same thing, you are going to get the same result. Maybe take some risks, do things they wouldn't normally do. Can't keep doing the same thing and expect things to change.\" He added: \"We have a plan B, a Plan C. We have some plans.\" At least one of those options is an approach to Mercedes to use their engines on a customer basis next year. McLaren-Honda's lack of performance is threatening their hopes of persuading two-time champion Fernando Alonso to stay with them next year. Brawn ruled out the F1 Group playing any role in trying to find the Spaniard a competitive car in 2018, as former F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone has been known to do with drivers in the past. Alonso said on Thursday that he would stay at McLaren if they were winning by September but that if they were not \"maybe it was time for a change of project\". Brown said: \"We want Fernando Alonso to stay. If we are not fortunate enough to keep him then we will find someone else. \"We have a lot of races between now and September so we will just focus on getting back up the field. That's what he wants and we want.\" Brawn's partner on the commercial side of the F1 Group, Sean Bratches, said he was confident of securing the future of the British Grand Prix despite the threat hanging over the race. Silverstone has strongly hinted it will activate a break clause that would end the contract after the 2019 race if F1 does not reduce its fee. The track's owners the British Racing Drivers' Club has until this year's race next month to action the clause. Bratches said: \"We are in conversations with the British Grand Prix and the team there and we are optimistic of having a long-term future of having a grand prix in Great Britain. \"We have three years to the last grand prix under the contract. So there is a lot of things that can happen in that period of time, notwithstanding what happens in the next three weeks.\" One likely scenario is that Silverstone will activate the break clause next month but that talks will continue between the two parties aimed at securing the future of the race beyond 2019 on the basis of a new contract.", "question": "Formula 1 technical and sporting boss Ross Brawn says he has @placeholder to help McLaren 's engine partner Honda with its performance problems .", "option_0": "retaliated", "option_1": "promised", "option_2": "offered", "option_3": "agreed", "option_4": "managed", "label": 2}

The Colombian official responsible for the programme, Rafael Pardo, said the government would invest $340m (Â£271m), which would benefit 50,000 families. Last year, President Juan Manuel Santos decided to suspend US-backed aerial fumigation of illegal coca crops. The government has set a goal of destroying 100,000 hectares of coca this year, and has yet to rule out other methods to bring coca levels down.

Dr Mathias said: \"The weaknesses in this document raise the question of whether the Forensics Strategy stands up as a strategy. It is missing a coherent vision for forensic services and a route-map to deliver it.\" Other criticisms the MPs made of the strategy include: The committee concluded that the government should publish a redrafted strategy after the Biometrics Strategy is released and police scoping work is completed. A Home Office spokesman disputed the committee's findings. \"We are confident that the Forensic Strategy, which was drafted after extensive consultation with experts, represents the best way for policing to develop an effective approach to procurement,\" he said. \"The strategy sets out a clear vision for the future of forensic service provision, but it is equally clear that it must be designed and delivered by policing. \"It has been designed specifically in order to sit alongside and complement the biometrics strategy and the two were developed in parallel.\"", "question": "The government plan for the future of forensic science in England and Wales is @placeholder and incoherent , MPs have said .", "option_0": "economic", "option_1": "available", "option_2": "vague", "option_3": "expected", "option_4": "continuing", "label": 2}

An inquiry later criticised the care she received from her health trust.

One of the core criticisms of the trust was its failure to act quickly when a health worker reported Ms Henderson's condition had deteriorated significantly.

The case, being heard in the High Court, must decide whether the claim contravenes the law which prohibits a person from recovering damages for the consequences of their own illegality.

{"article": "Giving mooncakes to relatives and business associates is an integral part of the festival, which is being celebrated on Monday across China. Mooncakes are traditionally filled with salted egg yolk and sweet lotus paste, and symbolise the moon. However, the festive season also turns into opportunities for officials to misuse public funds to purchase expensive mooncakes as gifts. This prompted the authorities to issue a strong warning against the practice ahead of the festival. As a result, several media outlets have observed a drop in sales of expensive mooncakes and other luxury items. \"This year many officials will think thrice before accepting gifts because of the government's anti-corruption drive,\" says the Shanghai Business Daily. The China Daily notes that expensive boxes of mooncakes have been pulled off from the shelves of many supermarkets. Zhou Shuzhen, a professor of clean-governance with Renmin University of China, tells the daily that the government is \"expected to regain the public's trust\" with the implementation of its frugality rules. \"What the top anti-graft watchdog banned is not just a small mooncake, but a type of corrupt behaviour that was hated by the people,\" she says.

A young man, wearing a shirt printed with an image of the flag used by the Japanese army until the end of World War Two was confronted by an angry crowd in Mount Taishan, Shandong province, on Saturday.

Commenting on the issue, the agency says \"going after after individual freedom... is extremely foolish\". The Beijing Youth Daily and The Beijing Times, however, raise questions over the violence displayed by the crowd and calls for a ban on controversial military symbols. \"Tearing off the T-shirt infringes the rights of the person. The public can express their opinion, but should not take law into their own handsâ€¦ Instead, as one of the biggest victims in World War Two, China should legislate a ban on the spread of such symbols,\" says The Beijing Times.

{"article": "Authorities found the pills - usually used to treat erectile dysfunction - while investigating corruption allegations against Ms Park. The government says the Viagra was bought to combat altitude sickness. The South Korean leader is accused of allowing her friend, Choi Soon-sil, to influence her decisions. The presidential office confirmed it bought 364 Viagra and similar generic pills to deal with altitude sickness on official trips to East Africa, although the pills were never used. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul, says the discovery of Viagra will add an air of remoteness to the president. Many Koreans believe Ms Park is living in a \"different world\" which will exacerbate political pressure on her to resign. Some early rumours among Koreans alleged Ms Park could have been involved with cultish rituals with her friend Ms Choi. Ms Choi, a long-time friend of Ms Park's, is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, a shadowy quasi-religious leader who was closely linked to Ms Park's father, then-president Park Chung-hee. How will India destroy 20 billion banknotes? Ellen DeGeneres lauded by Obama for gay rights influence Amazing white rainbow snapped over Scottish moor The discovery of Viagra grew out of the drug UK92480, a new treatment for angina, a heart condition that constricts the vessels that supply the heart with blood. It failed in treating angina, but during drug trials many volunteers reported an unusual side effect - lots of erections. Scientists ran more tests and discovered its effectiveness at treating erectile dysfunction. Because of biological similarities between the lungs and penis, scientists also discovered it could help protect against pulmonary hypertension, common in climbers. At high altitudes decreased levels of oxygen can trigger high blood pressure in the lungs, which in extreme circumstance can be fatal. Viagra reduces high blood pressure and improves the transport of oxygen in the blood. Meanwhile, South Korean authorities have raided the offices of Samsung and the national pension fund as part of a corruption investigation linked to the president. They are probing whether Ms Park pressured the fund to support a Samsung merger, said the Yonhap news agency. Samsung's offices had already been raided over related allegations. Wednesday's raid had to do with a merger last year between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries.

Meanwhile, the new justice minister has threatened to remove teams from the Petrobras inquiry if any more material is leaked to the press. In a statement, Brazil's presidency said Ms Rousseff will sue Senator Amaral for defamation over his interview with a magazine. He was the leader of her Workers' Party in the Senate and had agreed a plea bargain with prosecutors after being arrested as a result of the Petrobras scandal. What the Petrobras scandal is about Rousseff faces a perfect storm The inquiry has led to the arrest or investigation of dozens of executives and politicians, suspected of overcharging for contracts with Petrobras and using part of the money to pay for bribes and electoral campaigns. There is widespread public support for the investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, but Ms Rousseff and her allies have criticised its leading judge, Sergio Moro. They argue the inquiry has become politicised and some of his actions have been illegal. Last week, Mr Moro released phone recordings suggesting Ms Rousseff had appointed her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as her chief of staff to spare him arrest over money-laundering charges he denies. Even though Ms Rousseff vehemently denies it, Supreme Court judge Gilmar Mendes has suspended Lula's nomination, and a final decision is yet to be announced. Lula, the most hated and loved man in Brazil If Lula is a minister, any charges against him can only be dealt with by the Supreme Court, which operates more slowly, and not by Mr Moro. Earlier this month, Lula was briefly detained and questioned at Mr Moro's request. Ms Rousseff's supporters have also criticised leaks of questioning and details of the investigation to the media. New Justice Minister Eugenio Aragao questioned the publication of the unverified phone tap conversations between Ms Rousseff and Lula and said the Car Wash investigation was losing its objectivity. The release of the recordings has also been criticised by Supreme Court judge Marco Aurelio Mello, who has questioned its legality. However, the content of the phone calls has increased pressure on Ms Rousseff, who is facing growing calls for her removal. Additionally, there has been a resurgence in allegations of media bias against Ms Rousseff and her Workers' Party. Much of the criticism has been against Globo, the country's largest media group and one of the biggest in the world, allegations it denies.
